2022-11-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/politics/us-hypersonic-china-russia-competition/index.html,"US is increasing pace of hypersonic weapons development to chase China and Russia, senior admiral says","China and Russia are driving the US to develop hypersonic weapons faster as the Pentagon seeks to increase the pace of testing and research and avoid falling behind, a senior Navy admiral responsible for US efforts said. ""Up until just recently, there hasn't been a real driver for us to take that technology and put it into a weapon system. The need was not there,"" said Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, director of the Navy's Strategic Systems program. ""The need is now there, which is why we've got a sense of urgency to get after this."" Wolfe, speaking to CNN last month as the military carried out two rocket test launches to gather data for hypersonic development, acknowledged that China and Russia have developed weapons the US hasn't. Each of the two test launches carried about a dozen different experiments in different fields such as heat-resistant materials, high-end electronics, and lightweight materials, all of which are necessary to successfully develop and deploy a hypersonic weapon. Russia has deployed its own hypersonic Kinzhal missiles in Ukraine, marking perhaps the first time such weapons have been used in war. And during a test last year, a Chinese hypersonic missile flew around the world before hitting its target. ""China and Russia are the driver,"" said Wolfe. Hypersonic weapons travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, or approximately 4,000 miles per hour, making them difficult to detect and intercept in time. The missiles can also maneuver and vary altitude, allowing them to evade current missile defense systems. The Pentagon requested $4.7 billion for hypersonic research in the next fiscal year, up from $3.8 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service. The US is developing a number of different hypersonic weapons programs across the military services, but a string of testing failures plagued certain programs. The Air Force carried successful tests of its Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), but that came only after 3 consecutive testing failures. The Common Hypersonic Glide Body, a joint venture between the Army and Navy, also suffered a testing failure over summer during the first test of the full system. Not afraid of failure But Wolfe says failure should not be a dirty word since hypersonic systems are on the cutting edge of current capabilities. ""Every test is an opportunity to learn, regardless of what the final outcome is,"" he says. ""I think failure is part of the process. When you're looking at high-end technologies and you're looking at how you really want to lean in and get something in the warfighter's hands rapidly, we've got to accept the fact that to do that, we're going to take risks."" The Army plans to field the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) next year, which would make it the first hypersonic system fielded by the military. The system uses a two-stage booster rocket to accelerate a gliding projectile to hypersonic speeds. The glide body then coasts to its target at very high speeds, using its kinetic energy as a weapon. The Navy plans on fielding its own version of the system on Zumwalt-class guided missile destroyers in 2025, and a version for a submarine-launched hypersonic missile is currently scheduled late this decade. ""Fundamentally, it's just the next generation of missilery,"" says Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Karako says the US backed away from research and development around hypersonic programs in past years. But as China and Russia boosted investment in their own systems, the US has made it a priority to catch up, with its own aggressive schedules. ""We're not doing it just because they are. We're doing it for particular military needs,"" Karako said. ""You need that unpredictability, not just speed. Ballistic missiles will get you the speed, but it's the hypersonic gliders and scramjets that combine the speed with the maneuverability."" It's not only the world's superpowers looking at these high-end weapons. North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hypersonic missile earlier this year. And last week, Iran claimed its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force had developed a hypersonic missile. ""We've seen the reports asserted and coming out of Iran. We remain skeptical of these reports,"" said Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh. ""We will continue to monitor closely any development or proliferation of advanced technology coming out of Iran.""",49,0.0,0.0,0.0,12
2022-11-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/us-weapon-stocks-ukraine/index.html,US is running low on some weapons and ammunition to transfer to Ukraine,"As the first full winter of Russia's war with Ukraine sets in, the US is running low on some high-end weapons systems and ammunition available to transfer to Kyiv, three US officials with direct knowledge tell CNN. The strain on weapons stockpiles -- and the ability of the US industrial base to keep up with demand -- is one of the key challenges facing the Biden administration as the US continues to send billions of dollars of weapons to Ukraine to support its fight against Russia. One of the officials said the stockpiles of certain systems are ""dwindling"" after nearly nine months of sending supplies to Kyiv during the high-intensity war, as there's ""finite amount"" of excess stocks which the US has available to send. Among the weapons systems where there's particular concern about US stockpiles meeting Ukrainian demands are 155mm artillery ammunition and Stinger anti-aircraft shoulder-fired missiles, the sources said. Some sources also raised concerns about US production of additional weapons systems, including HARMs anti-radiation missiles, GMLRS surface-to-surface missiles and the portable Javelin anti-tank missiles -- although the US has moved to ramp up production for those and other systems. For the first time in two decades, the US is not directly involved in a conflict after withdrawing from Afghanistan and transitioning to an advisory role in Iraq. Without the need to produce weapons and ammunition for a war, the US has not manufactured the quantities of materiel needed to sustain an enduring, high-intensity conflict. Defense officials say the crunch is not affecting US readiness, as the weapons sent to Ukraine don't come out of what the US keeps for its own contingencies. But the seriousness of the problem is a source of debate within the Defense Department, officials say. While the US will not be able to provide high-end munitions to Ukraine indefinitely, assessing whether the US is ""running low"" on stockpiles is subjective, one senior defense official said, as it depends on how much risk the Pentagon is willing to take on. Multiple officials underscored that the US would never put at risk its own readiness, and every shipment is measured against its impact on US strategic reserves and war plans. Both Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley monitor levels of US stockpiles closely, officials said. A major manufacturing challenge One reason for the concern about low stockpiles is that the US industrial base is having difficulty keeping up with demand quickly enough, the sources said. In addition, European allies cannot sufficiently backfill Ukrainian military requests due to their need to maintain to their own forces' supplies. ""It's getting harder and harder,"" Rep. Mike Quigley, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN. ""This is a war we thought would be over in days but now could be years. At a time when global supply chains are melting down, the West is going to have a very difficult time to meet demands at this very high level."" Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder told CNN that the US will continue to support Ukraine ""as long as it takes,"" while adding that no weapons transfers to Ukraine have diminished US military readiness. ""DoD takes into consideration the impacts on our own readiness when drawing down equipment from US stocks"" Ryder said. ""We have been able to transfer equipment from US stocks without degrading our own military readiness and continue to work with industry to replenish US inventories and backfill depleted stocks of allies and partners."" At a press conference Wednesday following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, Austin touted the commitments of a half-dozen countries providing additional weapons to Ukraine, including Greece pledging more 155mm ammunition. ""All Ukraine is asking for is the means to fight, and we are determined to provide that means. Ukrainians will do this on their timeline, and until then, we will continue to support all the way for as long as it takes,"" Milley said at the press conference. ""It is evident to me and the contact group today that that is not only a US position, but it is a position of all the nations that were there today. We will be there for as long as it takes to keep Ukraine free."" The degree to which weapons stockpiles are running low varies system by system, as the US defense industrial base is better equipped to ramp up production of some weapons, while others are more difficult -- or the production line has been shut down altogether and can't be easily resumed. ""In most instances, the amounts given to Ukraine are relatively small compared to US inventories and production capabilities. However, some US inventories are reaching the minimum levels needed for war plans and training,"" Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a September article. ""The key judgment for both munitions and weapons is how much risk the United States is willing to accept."" The Pentagon said in a September fact sheet it had committed more than 806,000 155mm artillery rounds to Ukraine, for instance. Cancian wrote that ammunition for the 155mm howitzers was ""probably close to the limit that the United States is willing to give without risk to its own warfighting capabilities."" At the same time, he wrote that a dozen other countries could supply the same ammunition, and Ukraine was unlikely to be constrained in what it needed thanks to the global market. ""Someone saying uncomfortably low - that's a judgment,"" Doug Bush, Assistant Army Secretary for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, told reporters. ""You know, that's a judgment about risk between sending munitions to an ally to use them in combat versus a hypothetical other contingency that we need to stockpile for. You know, that's a judgment call."" 'No question' there is pressure on stockpiles Colin Kahl, the Pentagon's undersecretary for policy, told reporters in a recent roundtable, ""there's no question"" the weapons pipeline to Ukraine has put pressure on the stockpiles and industrial base of the US as well as its allies. ""Look, we're seeing the first example in many decades of a real high intensity conventional conflict and the strain that that produces on not just the countries involved but the defense industrial bases of those supporting, in this case supporting Ukraine,"" Kahl said. ""I will say Secretary (Lloyd) Austin has been laser-focused since the beginning in making sure that we were not taking undue risk. That is that we weren't drawing down our stockpiles so much that it would undermine our readiness and our ability to respond to another major contingency elsewhere in the world."" Kahl added that the support the US has provided to Ukraine has not put the US military ""in a dangerous position as it relates to another major contingency somewhere in the world,"" but he said it has revealed there's more work to do to make sure the US defense industrial base is more nimble and responsive. The questions about weapons stockpiles comes as Congress is finalizing the Pentagon budget for the current fiscal year through the annual National Defense Authorization Act as well as the government spending package Congress is expected to try to pass before government funding expires on December 16. The US military often turns to Congress for a funding boost -- lawmakers have routinely added billions to the Pentagon's budget requests in annual spending bills. The Biden administration on Tuesday sent a letter to Congress seeking an additional $37.7 billion in funding for Ukraine. The funding includes $21.7 for the Pentagon to be spent in part to address weapons shortages, according to a White House fact sheet that says the money the Defense Department spending is for ""equipment for Ukraine, replenishment of Department of Defense stocks, and for continued military, intelligence and other defense support."" The $37.7 billion request comes as Republicans are projected to reclaim the House majority in the next Congress, which could make it more difficult for the Biden administration to authorize funding to Ukraine next year. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy has said Republicans won't give Ukraine ""a blank check"" -- though he also clarified to his conference's foreign policy hawks that he supports continuing to fund Ukraine's war -- and there are numerous Republicans pushing for a significant curtailing of US aid to Ukraine.",49,0.0,0.0,0.0,8
2022-11-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/europe/poland-missile-russia-ukraine-investigation-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html,"Poland, NATO say missile that killed two likely fired by Ukraine defending against Russian attack","The leaders of Poland and NATO said the missile that killed two people in Polish territory on Tuesday was likely fired by Ukrainian forces defending their country against a barrage of Russian strikes, and that the incident appeared to be an accident. The blast occurred outside the village outside the rural eastern Polish village of Przewodow, about four miles (6.4 kilometers) west from the Ukrainian border on Tuesday afternoon, roughly the same time as Russia launched its biggest wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities in more than a month. On Wednesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda told a press conference that there was a ""high chance"" it was an air defense missile from the Ukrainian side and likely had fallen in Poland in ""an accident"" while intercepting incoming Russian missiles. ""There is no indication that this was an intentional attack on Poland. Most likely, it was a Russian-made S-300 rocket,"" Duda said in a tweet earlier Wednesday. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have used Russian-made munitions during the conflict, including the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, which Kyiv has deployed as part of its air defenses. The incident in Poland, a NATO country, prompted ambassadors from the US-led military alliance to hold an emergency meeting in Brussels Wednesday. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg too said there was no indication the incident was the result of a deliberate attack by either side, and that Ukrainian forces were not to blame for defending their country from Russia's assault. ""Our preliminary analysis suggests that the incident was likely caused by the Ukrainian air defense missile fired to defend Ukrainian territory against Russian cruise missile attacks,"" Stoltenberg said. ""But let me be clear, this is not Ukraine's fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility, as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine."" Stoltenberg also said there were no signs that Russia was planning to attack NATO countries, in comments that appeared to be intended to defuse escalating tensions. News of the incident overnight led to a flurry of activity thousands of miles away in Indonesia, where US President Joe Biden convened an emergency meeting with some world leaders to discuss the matter on the sidelines of the G20 summit. A joint statement following the emergency meeting at the G20 was deliberately ambiguous when it came to the incident, putting far more focus on the dozens of strikes that happened in the hours before the missile crossed into Poland. Duda and Stoltenberg's comments tally with those of two officials briefed on initial US assessments, who told CNN it appeared the missile was Russian-made and originated in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military told the US and allies that it attempted to intercept a Russian missile in that timeframe and near the location of the Poland missile strike, a US official told CNN. It's not clear that this air defense missile is the same missile that struck Poland, but this information has informed the ongoing US assessment of the strike. The National Security Council said that the US has ""full confidence"" in the Polish investigation into the blast and that the ""party ultimately responsible"" for the incident is Russia for its ongoing invasion. Investigations at the site where the missile landed will continue to be a joint operation with the US, Polish President Duda said Wednesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for Ukrainian experts to be allowed to the site. Zelensky said Wednesday he did not believe that the missile was launched by his forces, and called for Ukrainian experts to play a part in the investigation. ""I have no doubt that it was not our missile,"" he told reporters in Kyiv. Earlier Wednesday, a Zelensky adviser said the incident was a result of Russia's aggression but did not explicitly deny reports that the missile could have been launched by the Ukrainian side. ""Russia has turned the eastern part of the European continent into an unpredictable battlefield. Intent, means of execution, risks, escalation -- it is all coming from Russia alone,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said in a statement to CNN. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force said on national television Wednesday that the military would ""do everything"" to facilitate the Polish investigation. Earlier, Biden said that preliminary information suggested it was unlikely the missile that landed in Poland was fired from Russia, after consulting with allies at the G20 Summit in Bali. ""I don't want to say that [it was fired from Russia] until we completely investigate,"" Biden went on. ""It's unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia. But we'll see."" Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Russia doesn't have ""any relation"" with the missile incident in Poland, and that some leaders have made statements without understanding ""what actually happened."" ""The Poles had every opportunity to immediately report that they were talking about the wreckage of the S-300 air defense system missile. And, accordingly, all experts would have understood that this could not be a missile that had any relation with the Russian Armed Forces,"" Peskov said during a regular call with journalists. ""We have witnessed another hysterical frenzied Russophobic reaction, which was not based on any real evidence. High-ranking leaders of different countries made statements without any idea about what actually happened."" Russia's Ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya echoed Peskov on Wednesday, rejecting claims from other members of the UN Security Council that Russia was ultimately responsible for the missile incident in Poland on Tuesday. ""We have long ago stop being surprised by your attempts, in any circumstances in spite of fact or common sense, to blame Russia for everything,"" Nebenzya said during a UN Security Council meeting in New York. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told CNN that NATO allies must ""keep a cool head"" in light of the incident. ""I think we really have to keep a cool head, knowing there might be a spillover effect, especially to those countries that are very close [to Ukraine],"" Kallas told CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour in an interview Wednesday. The incident comes after Russia unleashed a barrage of 85 missiles on Ukraine Tuesday, predominantly targeting energy infrastructure. The bombardment caused city blackouts and knocked out power to 10 million people nationwide. Power has since been restored to eight million consumers, Zelensky later confirmed. Ukrainians across the country were expected to face further scheduled and unscheduled power cuts Wednesday.",49,4.959128815174683,3.6107365259329165,1.3483922892417666,25
2022-11-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/milley-ukraine-strength-russia/index.html,Top US general argues Ukraine may be in a position of strength to negotiate Russian withdrawal,"One week after saying there may be a window for peace talks to end the war in Ukraine, the top US general laid out a comprehensive list of Russia's failures and suggested negotiations -- if they were to occur -- would be done from a position of strength for Kyiv. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said the Russian military was ""really hurting bad"" after nearly nine months of war in which the Kremlin has failed to achieve any of its goals. The Ukrainians have racked up ""success after success after success,"" Milley quipped, while the Russians ""have failed every single time."" Those failures, Milley suggested, which come on top of Ukraine's recent liberation of Kherson, may even allow Ukraine to push for what it is unlikely to achieve militarily: a withdrawal of Russian forces. ""There may be a political solution where politically the Russians withdraw,"" Milley said at a press conference Wednesday. ""You want to negotiate at a time when you're at your strength, and your opponent is at weakness. And it's possible, maybe, that there'll be a political solution. All I'm saying is there's a possibility for it."" He was speaking following a meeting of allies who make up the Ukraine Contact Group and after leaders of Poland and NATO said the missile that killed two people in Polish territory on Tuesday was likely fired by Ukrainian forces defending their country against a barrage of Russian strikes, and that the incident appeared to be an accident. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, speaking at the same press conference, said the US has seen no information so far that ""contradicts"" Poland's ""preliminary assessment"". Milley appeared to be making a concerted effort to lay out his position on the state of the war, one week after he appeared to push for negotiations amid stabilizing front lines and a potential winter lull in fighting in comments that ruffled some allies and members of his own administration. Speaking in New York last Wednesday, Milley said both Russia and Ukraine will have to realize that military victory is impossible to achieve and that a negotiated end to the conflict would end the suffering of war. ""When there's an opportunity to negotiate, when peace can be achieved, seize it,"" Milley said at the time. Those remarks forced the Biden administration to reassure Ukraine that there had been no change in the US position of allowing the country to decide its own future or to pressure Kyiv into negotiations. Austin underscored that position on Wednesday, standing next to Milley at the press conference. ""What's a good time to negotiate? We've said repeatedly that the Ukrainians are going to decide that and not us."" Nevertheless, Milley laid out the realities of the fight ahead, with winter already setting in on the battlefields of Ukraine. Russia has knocked out parts of Ukraine's energy grid and infrastructure, leaving many homes without electricity or water. Ukraine's military has conducted successful counteroffensives in the east and the south, but the front lines are stabilizing, Milley said, and the fight tends to slow down in winter. Russia's mobilization efforts have also given them more manpower for the war, even if their troops arrive ill-equipped and with hardly any training. The odds of Ukraine achieving the outright military victory of pushing Russia out of the country are ""not high, militarily,"" he said. This time, Milley was more careful with his talk of negotiations, implicitly acknowledging that the chances of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reaching any sort of agreement still seem very off. ""So if there's a slowdown in the actual tactical fighting, if that happens, then that may become a window, possibly -- it may not -- for a political solution, or at least the beginnings of talks to initiate a political solution,"" he said. But one day after Russia launched perhaps the largest barrage of missiles against Ukraine, the US and the West made it clear they're preparing for a longer conflict, one in which Kyiv still needs air defenses and ammunition for the fight ahead. ""We will be there for as long as it takes to keep Ukraine free,"" said Milley.",7,2.5983241713500007,4.719134889095695,-2.1208107177456945,6
2022-11-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/us-intelligence-russia-withdrawal-midterm-election/index.html,CNN Exclusive: US intelligence suggests Russia put off announcing Kherson retreat until after midterm elections,"The US has intelligence that Russia may have delayed announcing its withdrawal from the Ukrainian city of Kherson in part to avoid giving the Biden administration a political win ahead of the midterm elections, according to four people familiar with the intelligence. Senior Russian officials discussed the US midterms as a factor during deliberations about the withdrawal announcement, one person familiar with the intelligence said. Waiting until after the US election was always a ""pre-planned condition"" of Russia's withdrawal from Kherson, a second person familiar with the intelligence told CNN. Still, the election was far from the only consideration in Russia's retreat, officials said. Military analysts say Russia had few other operational options and had been preparing to pull back for weeks, leading US officials to wonder when the Russians would officially acknowledge the withdrawal. While the intelligence is not a formal assessment of Russia's intentions, it is a sign that Russia has a continued interest in influencing the US political landscape — although the sources said Russia probably miscalculated the impact such an announcement would actually have on the elections. ""I doubt Americans would really have noticed,"" said another source familiar with western intelligence. President Joe Biden last week appeared to hint that the US believed that the timing of Russia's announcement was more than mere coincidence. ""I find it interesting they waited until after the election to make that judgement, which we knew for some time they were going to be doing, and it's evidence of the fact that they have some real problems -- the Russian military,"" Biden said at a press conference last Wednesday. Biden also said he hopes that with the elections over, the Russians will be more willing to negotiate the release of US citizens detained in Russia, including Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan. After the midterm elections, Griner's attorney announced that the US basketball star would be moved to a Russian penal colony where she is due to serve the remainder of a nine-year drug smuggling sentence that was upheld in late October. CIA Director Bill Burns was in Ankara on Monday discussing the American prisoners with his Russian counterpart, the National Security Council said, though the bulk of the discussion centered around managing the risk posed by nuclear weapons. The NSC declined to comment for this story. The intelligence suggesting that Russia wanted to avoid giving the Democratic administration and Congress positive news on the eve of the elections adds to a growing body of evidence that Russia is betting that a Republican-led United States will offer less support to Ukraine. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has hinted as much in recent interviews, telling CNN that a Republican House will more closely monitor and control the money and weapons flowing to Kyiv. Some Republicans say his public comments have been taken out of context and military support for Ukraine will remain high no matter who controls the House. Still, there remain vocal critics of US support for Ukraine in the GOP conference, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and JD Vance, the incoming Republican senator from Ohio. ""Even though there is still robust bipartisan agreement on Ukraine, the party that has been much more vocally supportive is the Democratic Party, and particularly the Biden administration,"" said one of the people familiar with the intelligence. Kremlin-linked oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin appeared to confirm last week what the US intelligence community has known for years: that the Russian government sought to support Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign in the 2016 and 2020 elections because it deemed him friendlier to its interests. ""We interfered, we interfere and we will interfere"" in US elections, Prigozhin, who runs the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm deployed during past US elections to spread disinformation, said on Telegram. According to private researchers, suspected Russian operatives also used far-right media platforms to denigrate Democratic candidates in a handful of battleground states in the week leading up to this year's midterm elections. Still, multiple US and congressional officials who track Russian influence operations say that if Russia did choose to time its official withdrawal from Kherson to the US midterms, it likely overestimated how much Americans care about individual battles in Ukraine. That demonstrates a lack of sophistication in Russia's information operations, these sources said. ""For all our hoopla about their information operations and political meddling, they're still not that great at it in the grand scheme,"" said the source familiar with western intelligence. ""There is some really fundamental cultural misunderstanding there."" Russian President Vladimir Putin himself did not announce the withdrawal — which Russia has termed a ""maneuver"" rather than a ""retreat"" — distancing himself from what has become a profound embarrassment for the Russian military. The withdrawal has been heavily criticized on Russian pro-war blogs. ""An announcement like this — no matter how Russia tries to spin it — it's still clear that they're giving up the only provincial capital that they seized during the invasion,"" said one of the people familiar with the intelligence. ""So it's a ton of egg on their face.""",20,4.3897905492225,6.557058666101609,-2.167268116879109,0

The sanctions target several aviation related companies and two individuals -- Abbas Djuma and Tigran Khristoforovich Srabionov -- who facilitated the Russian mercenary Wagner Group's ""acquisition of UAVs from Iran,"" according to the department. ""As we have demonstrated repeatedly, the United States is determined to sanction people and companies, no matter where they are located, that support Russia's unjustified invasion of Ukraine,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. ""Today's action exposes and holds accountable companies and individuals that have enabled Russia's use of Iranian-built UAVs to brutalize Ukrainian civilians. This is part of our larger effort to disrupt Russia's war effort and deny the equipment it needs through sanctions and export controls."" Last month, the US sanctioned an air transportation provider for its involvement in the shipment of the Iranian drones to Russia. Such drones have played a significant role in the conflict in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion in late February. They are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and striking only once an enemy asset is identified. Russia has launched a series of drone attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks, striking vital civilian infrastructure and sowing terror in Ukrainian cities far from the frontlines of the war. While Iranian officials for months denied supplying Russia with any weapons for use in Ukraine, Iran's government acknowledged this month sending a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine. ""Some western countries have accused Iran of helping the war in Ukraine by providing drones and missiles to Russia. The part regarding missiles is completely wrong. The part about drones is correct, we did provide a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of the war in Ukraine,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told reporters in Tehran. Officials from a western country that closely monitors Iran's weapons program also told CNN earlier this month that Iran is preparing to send more attack drones, along with surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles, to Russia to use in its war effort.",49,6.411746065067238,5.3342564575734,1.0774896074938374,11
2022-11-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/world/kyiv-strikes-russia-zelensky-peace-intl/index.html,Wave of Russian missiles hit Ukraine after Zelensky outlines conditions for peace at G20 summit,"Russia launched its biggest wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities in more than a month on Tuesday -- hours after Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky proposed a peace plan in front of world leaders at the G20 summit in Indonesia. Air raid sirens sounded out across Ukraine shortly after its leader outlined a 10-point plan including the withdrawal of Russian troops and the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity. The strikes targeted power infrastructure in several regions of the country, leaving more than seven million Ukrainians without power and the supply of electricity in a critical condition, according to senior Ukrainian officials. The deputy head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said that 15 facilities of Ukraine's energy infrastructure had been damaged during the Russian missile strikes, but Ukrainian air defenses had shot down 70 of more than 90 missiles fired at Ukraine. Two missiles or rockets also reportedly hit a farm in Poland near the border with Ukraine, killing two people, according to Polish media. It is unclear where the projectiles came from, but they landed roughly the same time as a Russian missile attack on western Ukraine. Two projectiles reportedly hit Poland around the same time as the Russian onslaught in Ukraine, with Polish media showing an image of a deep impact and upturned farm vehicle at the site, near the town of Przewodow. A government spokesman said that Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has convened the Committee of the Council of Ministers for National Security and Defense Affairs. Poland is a NATO member state, and the defense alliance is looking into the matter, a NATO official told CNN. Fellow NATO members the United States and the United Kingdom remained circumspect in their statements about the incident. A senior White House official said they do not have confirmation of any rocket or missile strike in Poland, but that US officials are currently working to try and figure out exactly what has happened. Zelensky in contrast blamed Russia for incident, which was echoed by NATO member Latvia. ""The terror is not limited to our national borders,"" Zelensky said in his daily address. Amid speculation over the projectiles' origin, Russia's Defense Ministry denied responsibility, saying there were ""no strikes made on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border."" Polish authorities also have not confirmed that Russian missiles landed in their territory. Power supplies disrupted in Ukraine At least a dozen cities and districts in Ukraine were targeted by Rusisan strikes, according to a CNN analysis of the missile strikes. The wave of strikes appears to be the largest since October 10, when Russia stepped up its campaign to destroy electricity, water and gas infrastructure across Ukraine. In a video message posted to Telegram on Tuesday evening local time, Zelensky said that 85 missile strikes had been launched against Ukraine so far, and warned there may be more to come. ""We can see what the enemy wants, they will not succeed,"" he said. ""We may yet have 20 more strikes, please look after yourselves, stay in shelter for some time."" In the capital, Kyiv, the city military administration said that one person had been killed. Two explosions had been heard, it added, instructing residents to remain in shelters. It said four missiles had been shot down. Kyiv mayor Vitaliy Klitschko then said there had been a third strike. ""Another hit in Pechersk district of Kyiv city. A high-rise building,"" Klitschko said. Power supplies were disrupted to several Ukrainian regions as a result of the missile strikes. State power supplier Ukrenergo said the Russians were ""trying to turn off the lights in the country again."" ""The attack is still ongoing, we cannot yet estimate the full extent of the damage, there are strikes on our infrastructure in all regions of the country, but the most difficult situation is in the northern and central regions,"" it added. In his video message, Zelensky said that authorities are working to restore power. ""We will withstand,"" he said. In addition the country ""is currently experiencing a major internet disruption,"" according to Netblocks, which tracks cybersecurity and connectivity around the world, with connectivity at 67% of previous levels. Neighboring Moldova also suffered power cuts following the Russian strikes on Ukraine, Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister and Infrastructure Minister Andrei Spinu said on Tuesday. Spinu said in a post on his Telegram account that ""following Russia's bombardment of the Ukrainian power system,"" one of the power lines carrying electricity to Moldova has been disconnected. Authorities are working to restore the connection to the line, which was not damaged but was disconnected as a safety measure, he added. Zelensky addresses G20 Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky set out a proposal for ending the Russian invasion, according to a transcript shared by the Embassy of Ukraine in Indonesia on Tuesday. The president's peace plan has 10 steps including a path to nuclear safety, food security, a Special Tribunal for Russian war crimes, and a final peace treaty with Russia, according to the speech transcript. He urged G20 leaders to use all of their power to ""make Russia abandon nuclear threats"" and implement a price cap on energy imported from Moscow. Zelensky also called on Russia to stop bombing Ukraine's energy infrastructure as winter approaches. ""Let Russia prove by its rejection of terror that it is really interested in the restoration of peace,"" he said. Moscow has been isolated at this year's G20 summit as multiple Western leaders vowed not to have any contact with its Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who is in attendance on behalf of the Kremlin. World leaders condemned Tuesday's strikes. At the summit, British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a tweet that the attacks targeting Ukrainian cities ""shows only Putin's weakness,"" who ""is losing on the battlefield and -- as we saw today at the G20 -- diplomatically too."" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said ""at the moment we are hearing again of brutal Russian missile attacks on Kyiv, Kharkiv and Lviv and other places, and especially again on civilian infrastructure,"" during remarks on Tuesday with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi in Berlin. She added that the attack ""is also an unprecedented attack on nuclear safety and nuclear security.""",47,5.653867582837368,7.380778691262204,-1.7269111084248365,25
2022-11-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/us-ukraine-military-drones-gray-eagle/index.html,US studying how to modify powerful armed drone as Ukrainian demand grows,"As Russian forces have retreated in Ukraine's south, the Biden administration has announced a slew of new military aid packages for Ukraine, but all were missing a piece of weaponry that Ukraine's military has long sought: the multi-use Gray Eagle drone, armed with Hellfire missiles. According to two officials, the US has been looking into modifications that can be made to the deadly drone. Changes that would make the potential of losing any -- with their sensitive onboard technology -- less of a danger and possibly increase the likelihood of Ukraine receiving them. ""There are specific and very technical tweaks and neutering that can be done to these that may make it possible in the nearer term,"" a congressional official said. ""But those things take time and are fairly complex."" A US official confirmed that the Army is leading the efforts to study what changes are possible to the drone, which is made by General Atomics and referred to in the Army as the MQ-1C. ""When you're talking drones, this is about as good as you can get,"" says Seth Jones, the director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""These are really sophisticated drones."" Without any changes however, the Gray Eagle, which can carry four Hellfire missiles and fly at 25,000 feet for almost 30 hours, would likely not be on upcoming lists of military aid allocated to Ukraine. ""There's still real interest in providing this particular system, provided we can make the necessary modifications and they are still useful to Ukraine on the battlefield,"" the US official said. Discussions over the Gray Eagle are ongoing and it has not been ruled out or officially denied to Ukraine, the US official and a Ukrainian official said. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the Pentagon had declined Ukraine's request. Ukraine is 'pushing back' ""We are pushing back, we didn't give up,"" the Ukrainian official said. ""This is about survivability [for Ukraine]."" Pentagon spokesman Colonel Roger Cabiness would not comment specifically on the Gray Eagle, saying only that the Department of Defense continues to consult with Ukraine on security assistance. The White House declined to comment and General Atomics did not respond to a request for comment. On top of the lethal capability of the missiles it carries, the Gray Eagle would allow Ukrainian forces greater ability to gather intelligence and carry out reconnaissance from farther away, expand the assistance of targeting by artillery on the ground and combat the drones flown by Russia. Throughout the war, the US has been slow and reluctant to provide Ukraine with dramatically more advanced and longer-range capabilities, like missiles that would allow Ukraine to strike inside Russia and therefore potentially be seen by Moscow as a significant escalation in the conflict. In the case of the Gray Eagle, a US official argued, the concern is less about escalation than technological security: the potential for the pricey drones to go down in Ukraine and be recovered by the Russians. ""These are very expensive systems and there are concerns that they could be shot down,"" said the official, declining to say what parts of the drone would be most dangerous if they end up in Russian hands. It's a scenario that the US has recently been on the receiving end of. After Iranian drones were shot down in Ukraine, the US was able to examine the wreckage, the Washington Post reported. The US official declined to elaborate on what technology on the Gray Eagle is the most sensitive but said they wouldn't be considered escalatory since similar capabilities are being provided. The technology in question likely centers on the imaging and intelligence-gathering capabilities and sensors, Jones from CSIS said, adding that he believes US fears are really rooted more in escalating the conflict with Russia.' ""You're really going to fly those pretty far back from the frontlines,"" he said. ""I don't think you'd risk them up close and you wouldn't need them up close because they can fire from a distance and they can collect [intelligence] from a distance."" US has modified weapon systems before This wouldn't be the first time modifications have been made to US systems to get them to Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that classified components were removed from Stinger antiaircraft missiles by simply taking out several screws. That was enough for the US to be able to ship them out. Like the Gray Eagle, the US has also so far pushed back on requests for the long-range ATAMCS missiles, with a range of around 200 miles (300 kilometers). Ukraine is so keen to get them that they have offered a remarkable level of transparency with the US, sharing their targets, sources told CNN. ""We need ATACMS,"" the Ukrainian official reiterated when asked what else, along with the Gray Eagle, is at the top of their wish list. A $400 million US package for Ukraine announced earlier this month included another commitment of more than 1,000 unmanned Phoenix Ghost drones. Unlike the Gray Eagle, those are smaller, single-use suicide drones. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late March, the Biden administration has supported Ukraine with increasingly advanced weapons. Pushing, while trying not to cross, a line that they believe Russia would see as overly escalatory. Last week, President Joe Biden reiterated his team's concerns, telling reporters at a news conference: ""I'm not looking for [Ukraine] to start bombing Russian territory."" Biden highlighted the fact that while the US has given Ukraine the highly-effective HIMARS mobile rocket systems, they have not been offered the longer-range munitions that go with those systems, which includes ATACMS. Nor have fighter jets been sent to Ukraine by any NATO country, perhaps the most hotly debated part of any discussion over what weapons should be given to Ukraine. They are still being considered, three people familiar with the discussions say. Whether that means US warplanes or Soviet-origin fighters like the Mig-29 is a key part of the conversation. The US could ask a country like Poland to give Ukraine Mig-29s and backfill Poland with American jets. Sending American warplanes directly to Ukraine makes little sense, the congressional official said, since there is little air-to-air combat, Ukrainian pilots aren't trained on them and they require significant maintenance. Then there's the question of how that would affect Russian President Vladimir Putin's calculus amid fears he could use a nuclear weapon. ""Are we pouring escalatory measures that might be tolerated by Putin into a bucket that at some point overflows?"" another person familiar with the discussions asked. ""What level is in that bucket right now? And how much volume are you proposing adding to it? Those are things US intelligence and defense officials are trying constantly to figure out."" Ukrainian officials are increasingly frustrated with the administration's general fears of escalation, pointing out that they could already have used the HIMARS -- the most advanced US system in Ukraine to date -- to hit Russian territory, but haven't. ""This is bullshit frankly, what kind of escalation?"" the Ukrainian official asked. ""They drop a nuclear bomb, or what we are afraid of? This I don't understand.""",49,5.493411718162828,2.643273436077257,2.8501382820855707,6
2022-11-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/us-artillery-south-korea-ukraine/index.html,"US plans to buy 100,000 rounds of artillery ammo from South Korea for Ukraine","The US intends to buy 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition from South Korean arms manufacturers to provide to Ukraine, a US official said, as part of a broader effort to find available weaponry for the high-intensity battles unfolding in Ukraine. As part of the deal, the US will purchase 100,000 rounds of 155mm howitzer ammunition, which will then be transferred to Ukraine through the US. The arrangement allows South Korea to stick to its public pledge that it would not send lethal aid to Ukraine. In a statement issued Friday morning, the South Korean Defense Ministry said it had not changed its position on shipping weapons to Ukraine, and that it believed the ""end user"" of the ammunition is the United States. ""Negotiations are ongoing between the US and Korean companies to export ammunition, in order to make up for the shortage of 155mm ammunition inventories in the US,"" the ministry said. The Pentagon said in a statement it has been ""in discussion"" about ""potential sales"" of ammunition by the US from South Korea. But statements from South Korea and the US make clear that the deal, which has been in the works for months, has not yet been finalized. The purchase of such a large supply of artillery ammunition is highly sensitive for South Korea, especially given the recent missile launches and weapon tests conducted by North Korea. South Korea has taken part in meetings of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, the multi-national group set up by the United States to identify available stockpiles of weapons and ship them to Ukraine. But Seoul has so far publicly refused to send lethal aid to Ukraine, only delivering non-lethal and humanitarian aid, such as medical supplies and bulletproof vests. News of the transfer, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as the US has warned that North Korea is secretly supplying Russia with artillery shells for the war in Ukraine. The intended transfers from both Pyongyang and Seoul highlight the pressure the war has put on the defense industrial bases of US and Russia. ""There's no question that it's put pressure on our own stockpiles,"" said Colin Kahl, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, speaking to reporters at a virtual meeting of George Washington University's Project for Media and National Security. ""It's put pressure on our own industrial base. That's been true of our allies."" Since the early months of the war, artillery has been one of the key weapons provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russian forces. The Ukrainian military previously relied on Soviet-era 152mm artillery pieces, but as that ammo supply ran dry, the US and Western countries transitioned them to NATO-standard 155mm howitzers. To date, the US has sent in 142 of these artillery pieces. The challenge has been the supply of ammunition as the war nears its 9-month mark. ""[The war] has revealed that we have work to do to make our defense industrial base more nimble, more responsive, more resilient,"" Kahl said. The US has sent nearly one million rounds of 155mm ammo to Ukraine in recent months. Last week, a defense official said Ukraine is going through 4,000 to 7,000 rounds of artillery ammunition per day, while Russia is firing approximately 20,000 rounds. Although the main focus is now on air defense systems to protect Ukraine against Russian UAVs and missiles, artillery remains critical to the fight on the ground. Officials emphasized that the deal between the US and South Korea would not affect the readiness of either country. In a statement, the Pentagon said South Korea has a ""world-class defense industry which regularly sells to allies and partners, including the US."" The US ""has been in discussions about potential sales of ammunition to the United States by the South Korean non-governmental industrial defense base,"" said Lt. Col. Martin Meiners. The Pentagon would not comment on details of the discussions, including specific numbers or timelines. In August, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said he wanted to make the country one of the world's top weapons suppliers. Yoon's goal is to make Seoul the fourth-largest supplier in the world, behind only the United States, Russia and France. Though South Korea has been willing to provide weapons to Europe -- in July, it signed its largest arms deal to provide Poland with tanks, artillery, and fighter jets -- it has so far refused to sell or deliver weapons directly to Ukraine.",49,4.887527695133297,5.435579976054736,-0.5480522809214392,21
2022-11-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/politics/microsoft-russian-linked-hackers-poland-ukraine/index.html,Microsoft blames Russian military-linked hackers for ransomware attacks in Poland and Ukraine,"Hackers linked to Russia's military were very likely behind ransomware attacks last month on Ukrainian and Polish transportation and logistics organizations, Microsoft said Thursday. The revelation will raise concerns in Washington and European capitals that allies supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion could face greater cyber threats from Moscow. Poland is a NATO member and a key conduit for supplying military aid to Ukraine. The hacks ""did cause damage"" at the transportation and logistics companies in Poland and Ukraine, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN. The extent of the damage was unclear. CNN has requested further details from Microsoft. Microsoft attributed the hacks to a group that the Justice Department alleges works on behalf of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency and which caused power blackouts in parts of Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. One of Ukraine's main cybersecurity agencies, the State Special Communications Service, declined to comment. It's a rare public example of an alleged Russian hack related to the war causing damage in a NATO member country. During Russia's February invasion, another suspected Russian hack wiped data at two Ukrainian government contractors with a presence in Latvia and Lithuania, but that was widely seen among analysts as collateral damage rather than deliberate. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said a cyberattack could trigger NATO's collective defense clause, requiring all members to defend an attack on another member. But that has never happened, and it is unclear what exactly NATO's threshold in cyberspace is for a response. ""We do not state openly what level or damage the cyber-attack would have to cause,"" NATO spokesperson Matthias Eichenlaub said in an email. ""Any invocation of article 5 is always a political decision taken by all Allies by consensus."" The GRU-linked ransomware attacks signal ""increased risk to organizations directly supplying or transporting humanitarian or military assistance to Ukraine,"" researchers from Microsoft, which has worked directly with the Ukrainian government to respond to the hacks, said in a statement. The Russian embassy in Washington, DC, did not respond to a request for comment on Microsoft's statement. Moscow routinely denies conducting cyberattacks. Russian hacking groups have carried out a slew of cyberattacks during the war on Ukrainian government and corporate networks in activity that sometimes overlaps with Russia military strikes. But the kind of high-impact hack that takes out power or other critical networks has largely been missing. Russian hacking has played a peripheral, rather than central, role in the Kremlin's efforts to dismantle Ukrainian critical infrastructure, US and Ukrainian officials previously told CNN.",20,5.297167639211846,4.768791702807822,0.5283759364040241,2
2022-11-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/europe/yevgeny-prigozhin-russia-us-election-meddling-intl/index.html,Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin appears to admit to US election interference,"Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin-linked oligarch known as ""Vladimir Putin's chef,"" appeared to admit to Russian interference in US elections in a Telegram post on Monday. Prigozhin said that Russia has interfered, is interfering and will continue to interfere in the US democratic process, in response to a journalist's question about Russia potentially meddling in US congressional elections on Tuesday. ""I will answer you very subtly, and delicately and I apologize, I will allow a certain ambiguity. Gentlemen, we interfered, we interfere and we will interfere,"" Prigozhin said. ""Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way, as we know how. During our pinpoint operations, we will remove both kidneys and the liver at once,"" he added. Prigozhin has no post in the Russian government, but his statement appeared to be the first admission of a high-level Russian campaign to interfere in US elections from someone close to the Kremlin. Prigozhin is reportedly one of Putin's trusted confidants -- so close that the Russian press dubbed him the ""chef"" to the Russian President after he began catering events for the Kremlin. Prigozhin subsequently won lucrative catering contracts for schools and Russia's armed forces, and by 2010 he was a Kremlin insider with a growing commercial empire. It was not immediately clear how serious Prigozhin was being in his comments, which appeared to have been made somewhat sarcastically. But the US has sanctioned Prigozhin for funding the Internet Research Agency, a notorious Russian troll farm accused of meddling in several recent US elections. Prigozhin was also charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States in 2018 by special counsel Robert Mueller in relation to the alleged election meddling. The Kremlin has been accused of interfering in US elections since at least 2016, when Russia-linked hackers successfully hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Those documents were released during the homestretch of the campaign to embarrass the Democratic nominee. US officials and prosecutors warned of similar hacking attempts and disinformation campaigns by Russia ahead of the 2020 presidential elections and Tuesday's contest. Private researchers said Thursday that suspected Russian operatives have used far-right media platforms to denigrate Democratic candidates in Georgia, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Russian government officials, including Putin, have consistently denied interfering in American politics. US officials appeared unsurprised by Prigozhin's admission of election interference. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said it ""didn't tell us anything we didn't already know."" ""His full confession, if anything, appears to be just a manifestation of the impunity that crooks and cronies enjoy under President Putin and the Kremlin,"" Price said at a State Department briefing. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said it's ""not surprising"" that Russia is attempting to promote narratives ""aimed at undermining democracy."" ""We also know that part of Russia's efforts includes promoting narratives aimed at undermining democracy and sowing division and discord. It's not surprising that Russia would be highlighting their attempted efforts and fabricating a story about their successes on the eve of an election,"" Jean-Pierre added. She, however, did not weigh in on whether there are any ongoing attempts by Russia to influence the midterm elections, directing that question to the Director of National Intelligence. Prigozhin for years operated mostly in the shadows and behind the scenes. In recent months, however, he has developed a more public persona, possibly due to shifting power balances inside Russia as losses in Ukraine piled up. In September, Prigozhin admitted to founding the Wagner Group -- a private mercenary group accused of war crimes in Africa, Syria and Ukraine -- after years of denying involvement with the outfit. More recently, US and European officials alleged that Prigozhin is attempting to use the faltering war effort to jockey for increased influence in the Kremlin. Prigozhin reportedly confronted Putin directly about his belief that the conflict is being mismanaged. The Kremlin has denied that officials have criticized the management of the war.",20,5.002771035954742,4.834675220923115,0.16809581503162718,14
2022-11-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/middleeast/iran-drones-russia-intl/index.html,Iran acknowledges providing drones to Russia before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine,"The Iranian government acknowledged for the first time Saturday that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine. The statement by Iran's foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian comes after previous denials by Tehran that it had supplied Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, saying it ""has not and will not"" do so. Amirabdollahian did not say if the drones that were supplied to Moscow were the type that carry explosives. ""Some western countries have accused Iran of helping the war in Ukraine by providing drones and missiles to Russia. The part regarding missiles is completely wrong. The part about drones is correct, we did provide a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of the war in Ukraine,"" Amirabdollahian told reporters in Tehran. Self-detonating drones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its invasion in late February. They are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and striking only once an enemy asset is identified. Russia has launched a series of drone attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks, striking vital civilian infrastructure and sowing terror in Ukrainian cities far from the frontlines of the war. Ukrainian officials said last week that they had shot down more than 300 Iranian drones. Officials from a western country that closely monitors Iran's weapons program also told CNN that Iran is preparing to send more attack drones, along with surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles, to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine. The last shipment of weapons from Iran to Russia included about 450 drones, officials said, which the Russians have already used to deadly effect in Ukraine. Amirabdollahian claimed Tehran had reached an agreement with Ukraine to review evidence that Russia had used Iranian drones in the war. ""We agreed with the foreign minister of Ukraine to provide us with any documents they have that Russia used Iranian drones in Ukraine,"" he said, adding that an Iranian delegation had planned to meet with Ukrainian officials in Europe to discuss the issue, but that the gathering was canceled by Kyiv. ""We had such an appointment two weeks ago in a European country, a military and political delegation went to that European country, but unfortunately at the last minute the Ukrainian delegation did not attend due to pressure from the US and some European countries, in particular Germany,"" Amirabdollahian added. The Iranian foreign minister said he spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba last week and they agreed to let Iran review any evidence Ukraine has in the coming days. ""Of course, if it is proven that Russia used Iranian drones in the war against Ukraine, we will not remain indifferent to this issue,"" Amirabdollahian said. ""Our position regarding the war in Ukraine is to cease the war, return the parties to negotiations, and return displaced persons to their homes,"" he continued.

2022-11-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/politics/russia-cyber-attacks-missiles-ukraine-blackouts/index.html,Russian missile strikes overshadow cyberattacks as Ukraine reels from blackouts,"Russia has pummeled Ukrainian cities with missile and drone strikes for much of the past month, targeting civilians and large swaths of the country's critical infrastructure. By Monday, 40% of Kyiv residents were left without water, and widespread power outages were reported across the country. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of 'energy terrorism' and said that about 4.5 million Ukrainian consumers were temporarily disconnected from the power supply. The destruction exemplifies how indiscriminate bombing remains the Kremlin's preferred tactic eight months into its war on Ukraine. Moscow's vaunted hacking capabilities, meanwhile, continue to play a peripheral, rather than central, role in the Kremlin's efforts to dismantle Ukrainian critical infrastructure. ""Why burn your cyber capabilities, if you're able to accomplish the same goals through kinetic attacks?"" a senior US official told CNN. But experts who spoke to CNN suggest there is likely more to the question of why Russia's cyberattacks haven't made a more visible impact on the battlefield. Effectively combining cyber and kinetic operations ""requires a high degree of integrated planning and execution,"" argued a US military official who focuses on cyber defense. ""The Russians can't even pull that sh*t off between their aviation, artillery and ground assault forces."" A lack of verifiable information about successful cyberattacks during the war complicates the picture. A Western official focused on cybersecurity said the Ukrainians are likely not publicly revealing the full extent of the impacts of Russian hacks on their infrastructure and their correlation with Russian missile strikes. That could deprive Russia of insights into the efficacy of their cyber operations, and in turn affect Russia's war planning, the official said. To be sure, a flurry of suspected Russian cyberattacks have hit various Ukrainian industries, and some of the hacks have correlated with Russia's military objectives. But the kind of high-impact hack that takes out power or transportation networks have largely been missing. Nowhere was that more evident than the recent weeks of Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. That's a stark contrast to 2015 and 2016 when, following Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, it was Russian military hackers, not bombs, that plunged more than a quarter million Ukrainians into darkness. ""All the Ukrainian citizens are now living in these circumstances,"" said Victor Zhora, a senior Ukrainian government cybersecurity official, referring to the blackouts and water shortages. ""Imagine your ordinary day in the face of constant disruptions of power or water supply, mobile communication or everything combined."" 'Big, showy public response' Cyber operations aimed at industrial plants can take many months to plan, and after the explosion in early October of a bridge linking Crimea to Russia, Putin was ""trying to go for a big, showy public response to the attack on the bridge,"" the senior US official said. But officials tell CNN that Ukraine also deserves credit for its improved cyber defenses. In April, Kyiv claimed to thwart a hacking attempt on power substations by the same group of Russian military hackers that caused blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. The war's human toll has overshadowed those triumphs. Ukrainian cybersecurity officials have for months had to avoid shelling while also doing their jobs: protecting government networks from Russia's spy agencies and criminal hackers. Four officials from one of Ukraine's main cyber and communications agencies — the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) — were killed October 10 in missile attacks, the agency said in a press release. The four officials did not have cybersecurity responsibilities, but their loss has weighed heavily on cybersecurity officials at the agency during another grim month of war. Better prepared after years of attacks Hackers linked with Russian spy and military agencies have for years targeted Ukrainian government agencies and critical infrastructure with an array of hacking tools. At least six different Kremlin-linked hacking groups conducted nearly 240 cyber operations against Ukrainian targets in the buildup to and weeks after Russia's February invasion, Microsoft said in April. That includes a hack, which the White House blamed on the Kremlin, that disrupted satellite internet communications in Ukraine on the eve of Russia's invasion. ""I don't think Russia would measure the success in cyberspace by a single attack,"" the Western official said, rather ""by their cumulative effect"" of trying to wear the Ukrainians down. But there are now open questions among some private analysts and US and Ukrainian officials about the extent to which Russian government hackers have already used up, or ""burned,"" some of their more sensitive access to Ukrainian critical infrastructure in previous attacks. Hackers often lose access to their original way into a computer network once they are discovered. In 2017, as Russia's hybrid war in eastern Ukraine continued, Russia's military intelligence agency unleashed destructive malware known as NotPetya that wiped computer systems at companies across Ukraine before spreading around the world, according to the Justice Department and private investigators. The incident cost the global economy billions of dollars by disrupting shipping giant Maersk and other multinational firms. That operation involved identifying widely used Ukrainian software, infiltrating it and injecting malicious code to weaponize it, said Matt Olney, director of threat intelligence and interdiction at Talos, Cisco's threat intelligence unit. ""All of that was just as astonishingly effective as the end product was,"" said Olney, who has had a team in Ukraine responding to cyber incidents for years. ""And that takes time and it takes opportunities that sometimes you can't just conjure."" ""I'm pretty certain [the Russians] wish that they had what they burned during NotPetya,"" Olney told CNN. Zhora, the Ukrainian official who is a deputy chairman at SSSCIP, called for Western governments to tighten sanctions on Russia's access to software tools that could feed its hacking arsenal. ""We should not discard the probability that [Russian government hacking] groups are working right now on some high-complexity attacks that we will observe later on,"" Zhora told CNN. ""It is highly unlikely that all Russian military hackers and government-controlled groups are on vacation or out of business."" Tanel Sepp, Estonia's ambassador-at-large for cyber affairs, told CNN that it's possible the Russians could turn to a ""new wave"" of stepped up cyberattacks as their battlefield struggles continue. ""Our main goal is to isolate Russia on the international stage"" as much as possible, Sepp said, adding that the former Soviet state has not communicated with Russia on cybersecurity issues in months.",20,4.957757521711295,6.227070513519596,-1.2693129918083015,2
2022-11-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/north-korea-russia-ammunition/index.html,First on CNN: US accuses North Korea of trying to hide shipments of ammunition to Russia,"The US is accusing North Korea of secretly supplying Russia with artillery shells for the Ukraine war by concealing where they are being transported to, according to newly declassified intelligence. US officials believe that the surreptitious North Korean shipments -- along with drones and other weaponry that Russia has acquired from Iran -- are further evidence that even Moscow's conventional artillery arsenals have dwindled during eight months of combat. North Korea is trying to hide the shipments by making it appear as if the ammunition is being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa, the intelligence says. The recent intelligence comes about two months after the US intelligence community said that it believed Russia was in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for use on the battlefield, CNN and other outlets reported at the time. ""In September, the (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) publicly denied that it intended to provide ammunition to Russia,"" the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said in a statement to CNN. ""However, our information indicates that the DPRK is covertly supplying Russia's war in Ukraine with a significant number of artillery shells, while obfuscating the real destination of the arms shipments by trying to make it appear as though they are being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa."" Officials did not provide evidence to support the new allegations. The declassified intelligence also did not provide details about how many weapons are part of the shipments, or how they would be paid for. ""We will continue to monitor whether these shipments are received,"" Kirby said, noting that Russia has continued to look to actors like North Korea and Iran to sustain its aggressive war in Ukraine ""amid supply shortages and the efficacy of international sanctions."" Ongoing effort to resupply Russian artillery American officials, however, have publicly touted the alleged deal as evidence that Russia is running out of weapons to continue the war. As recently as two weeks ago, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines argued that ""export controls are forcing Russia to turn to countries like Iran and North Korea for supplies, including UAVs, artillery shells and rockets."" Kirby said on Wednesday that the support from Iran and North Korea is ""not going to change the course of the war,"" with the US remaining committed to providing Ukraine with continued security assistance. But the shipments may now help Russia to bolster an important part of its war effort: a grinding artillery fight on the front lines. ""It could be significant development because one of the challenges for Russia has been sustaining artillery fire,"" said Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses, who emphasized he had no knowledge of the underlying intelligence. ""The Russian army has likely gone through millions of shells at this point."" Russia has been ""offsetting a deficit of manpower with much higher output of fires,"" Kofman said, a strategy that he said has ""likely been very costly on ammunition supplies"" and has left Russia, like Ukraine, scouring the globe for countries with Soviet-caliber artillery supplies that are compatible with its systems in order to sustain the war. In the weeks before the new intelligence was acquired, some military and intelligence officials were beginning to believe that North Korea was backing away from its agreement to provide weaponry to Russia, multiple officials explained to CNN. Some officials had begun to tout it as a victory for the Biden administration's strategy of selectively declassifying and publicizing some classified intelligence on Russia's pursuit of the war, believing that when the United States made the deal known, it shed an unwelcome light on a transaction that Pyongyang did not want disclosed. But now, US officials say that despite North Korea's denials, they believe the rogue regime has moved ahead with its support for Moscow as the war appears poised to grind into its second year. US officials have argued publicly that Russia has been forced to turn to North Korea and Iran for weaponry both because it has burned through its stockpiles in a conflict that has stretched many months longer than anticipated and because US and western export controls have made it more difficult for Russia to acquire the technological components it needs to rebuild its stocks on its own. US officials have said they will work to expose and counter the shipments to Russia from Iran and North Korea and target the networks that enable these shipments, but they have not explicitly laid out how they plan to do that. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Tuesday that the US military ""has engaged in interdictions"" of weapons shipments in the past, but would not say if interdictions are being considered as weapons flow into Russia. 'They're anxious for ammunition anywhere they can get it' The new intelligence that Russia is acquiring artillery shells from North Korea suggests that its shortages run deeper than just more sophisticated, precision-guided munitions, which US and western officials have long emphasized is a weak point in the Russian arsenal. It also extends to basic artillery. ""The Russians, by many accounts, are really wearing thin when it comes to some of those inputs that it needs to prosecute its war on Ukraine,"" Price said on Tuesday, pointing to export controls and sanctions that have starved Russia of the inputs to make certain weapons. The precise state of of Russia's conventional munitions stocks isn't publicly known, but Russia is ""burning through tens of thousands of rounds a day,"" said Adam Mount, the director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists, who specializes in North Korea. ""They're anxious for ammunition anywhere they can get it."" Over the summer, Russia was able to make some grinding progress in parts of Ukraine through a punishing artillery campaign. But since then, western-provided artillery has contributed to a successful counteroffensive push by Ukraine that has retaken large swaths of territory previously held by Russia. North Korea would likely be able to provide Russia with 122- or 152-millimeter artillery shells and either tube artillery or multiple-rocket-launcher artillery that would be compatible with Russia's systems, said Bruce Klingner, a former Korea analyst at the CIA who is now at the Heritage Foundation. But for now, it's unclear how impactful North Korea's artillery shells will be to Russia on the battlefield. In 2010, North Korea fired 170 122-millimeter shells at South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island. Fewer than half hit the island, and of those, about a quarter failed to detonate -- a high failure rate that ""suggests that some DPRK-manufactured artillery munitions, especially (multiple rocket launcher) rounds, suffer from either poor quality control during manufacture or that storage conditions and standards are poor,"" according to a 2016 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The last time that they made use of these systems showed that their systems were fairly inaccurate,"" Mount said. ""You'd expect these Soviet-era systems are aging so they will start to break down."" This has been updated with additional reporting.",49,3.693666336590006,3.0168255922172635,0.6768407443727424,21
2022-11-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/politics/iran-missiles-russia/index.html,"Iran is preparing to send additional weapons including ballistic missiles to Russia to use in Ukraine, western officials say","Iran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine, officials from a western country that closely monitors Iran's weapons program told CNN. The shipment is being closely monitored because it would be the first instance of Iran sending advanced precision guided missiles to Russia, which could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield. The last shipment of weapons from Iran to Russia included about 450 drones, officials said, which the Russians have already used to deadly effect in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said last week that they have shot down more than 300 Iranian drones. This new expected shipment would mark a significant increase in Iranian support to Russia's war effort. While the precise timing of when the shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will definitely be delivered before the end of the year. Drones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired drones from Iran. In recent weeks these Iranian drones have been used to target critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine. The Iranian drones are known as a ""loitering munition"" because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified. They are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance. Yuriy Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force Command, said on Tuesday that Ukraine currently has ""no effective defense against these missiles. It is theoretically possible to shoot them down, but it is very difficult to do it with the means we currently have."" The US has also alleged that Iran has sent military personnel to Crimea to assist Russian drone attacks on Ukrainian targets. Sending further Iranian weaponry to Russia is a move that will likely cause relations with the US to further deteriorate. On Monday, the US envoy to Iran Rob Malley said the Biden administration is not going to ""waste our time"" on talks to revive the nuclear deal ""if nothing's going to happen."" Tehran's support for Russia in the Ukraine war and its crackdown on nationwide protests prompted by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September have prompted the US to impose further sanctions on Iran. Earlier this month John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council, said the presence of Iranian personnel was evidence of Tehran's direct engagement in the conflict. ""We can confirm that Russian military personnel that are based in Crimea have been piloting Iranian UAVs, using them to conduct strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv,"" Kirby said, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles. Malley spoke out strongly against Iran supplying the drones on Monday. ""We know that those drones have been used to target civilians and civilian infrastructure. And we know that Iran, in the face of all of this evidence, keeps lying and denying that it's happening,"" Malley said. On Monday a senior US defense official said they didn't have any information to provide on the suggestion Iran is preparing to send missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. On Tuesday a Pentagon spokesman said the US has ""concerns"" that Russia may ""seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran,"" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday. ""We do have concerns that Russia may also seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran, for example surface-to-surface missiles, to use in Ukraine,"" Ryder said. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment about the new expected shipment. Iran has previously denied supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, saying it ""has not and will not"" do so. The Washington Post was first to report Iran's plans to send missiles and additional drones to Russia. The US is ""looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions"" in order to disrupt the Iranian weaponry from going to Russia, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said last week. He said that the US is ""trying to break up these networks."" But it is unclear if the US will be able to prohibit further shipments from going ahead, even as concerns mount about Iranians sending even more advanced weaponry to Russia. US officials have also said that they are aware of discussions about additional Iranian weaponry to Russia that has not yet been delivered. Last month the US sanctioned an air transportation provider for its involvement in the shipment of the Iranian drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Russia. The US is also ready to ""target producers and procurers"" contributing to the UAV program, the Treasury Department's Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence said. The question of longevity and sustainability remains because it is unclear how long Iran can or would continue providing weaponry -- including more advanced missiles -- to Russia.",49,3.070377840167332,4.40944509296536,-1.3390672527980279,11
2022-10-31,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/europe/russian-missile-strikes-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Russian missiles bombard cities across Ukraine, hitting power and water infrastructure","Russia launched a barrage of missile strikes at Ukrainian cities on Monday as it ramped up its attacks on infrastructure facilities across the country. Explosions and air raid sirens were heard in Kyiv early on Monday and 80% of residents were left without water -- with many losing electricity, too -- following power outages caused by Russian strikes, the capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram. One of the strikes hit an energy facility that powered 350,000 apartments in the capital, Klitschko said, adding that emergency services were attempting to restore power and ""stabilize the situation as soon as possible."" Attacks on critical infrastructure in the central regions of Cherkasy and Kirovohrad, the eastern region of Kharkiv, and the southern region of Zaphorizhzhia were also reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that the onslaught was ""partly"" a response to an attack on Russia's fleet in the Crimean city of Sevastopol on Saturday, which he blamed on Kyiv. Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014 and has controlled the territory since then. Putin also warned that the strikes are ""not all we could do."" Shot down by Ukraine The Ukrainian military said it had eliminated about 90% of the Russian missiles used in the attacks. ""The enemy attacked military and civilian infrastructure facilities with 55 aircraft guided missiles, 45 of which were shot down by our defenders,"" the military's General Staff said. By Monday afternoon, power was still partially out for many -- though it had been restored to some. ""Power engineers plan to stabilize the situation with the electricity supply at about 9-10 pm."" Klitschko said on Telegram, adding: ""But even after the resumption of electricity supply, power cuts will still be applied. Because the situation is difficult."" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that diplomats ""are in constant contact with their partners"" to try to get assistance and equipment to repair the extensive damage. Kyiv is in touch with the European Union and NATO as well as several governments. It had already concluded agreements in 12 countries to obtain nearly 1,000 units of power equipment, including generators, according to Kuleba. ""We continue to work on increasing the number of partners and the volume of support,"" he added. Earlier, Klitschko urged residents of the capital to stock up on water from shops and pumping stations after an attack on a nearby power facility. ""Currently, due to damage to the energy facility near Kyiv, 80% of the capital's consumers remain without water supply,"" he said on Telegram. ""Just in case, we ask you to stock up on water from the nearest pumps and points of sale. Specialists are doing everything possible to return water to the apartments of Kyiv residents."" Speaking to CNN on the ground in Kyiv, 31-year-old Yana Lysenko said: ""Monday morning has started horribly as usual. I have a 4-year-old child, so of course I feel stressed. ""We don't have water right now, but we do have electricity. We hope that the services will restore everything very quickly. Our spirit is very high, and we are waiting for victory. Such terrorist actions targeting water and electricity supply, I believe, do not scare people anymore."" Viktor Halashan, aged 70, told CNN he is remaining positive despite having no water supply. ""Not having water is fine, we can handle this,"" he said, adding that he hopes Ukraine's ""troops will get us closer to victory soon."" Local office worker Oleksandr Nechepuriak told CNN he was collecting water for 15 people. ""It's important to get (the)office running,"" said Nechepuriak, who works in food production. ""We will handle this,"" he said, adding that there are ""no other options."" Homes in Kharkiv also without water Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, described the attacks as ""barbaric,"" saying on Facebook: ""Electric substations, hydropower and heat generation facilities were hit by rocket fire."" He added: ""As a result of this massive attack, there was a partial blackout and emergency power outage schedules were introduced for consumers in Kyiv, Cherkasy (and) Zaporizhzhia, and Cherkasy, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, (and) Poltava regions."" The water supply in Kharkiv -- Ukraine's second-largest city -- was also affected after an infrastructure facility was hit, while most subway train services were halted, mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram. ""The blow fell on a critical infrastructure facility, resulting in the subway and ground electric transport being de-energized,"" he said. ""At the moment, we have managed to launch the Kholodnohirsko-Zavodska (subway) line, and we have replaced trolleybuses and trams with buses."" Terekhov said engineers were ""doing everything possible to resume water supply to the homes of Kharkiv residents as soon as possible."" Two missiles hit Kharkiv on Monday morning, the mayor had previously said on Telegram. And in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, one missile hit an industrial enterprise, mayor Oleksandr Vilkul said on Telegram. ""During the morning missile attack, two missiles were shot down (thanks to the Air Defense Forces), and one cruise missile hit an industrial enterprise,"" he said. There were no casualties reported. Monday's strikes hit 10 regions and damaged 18 facilities, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Telegram. ""Their target was not military facilities, but civilian critical infrastructure,"" Shmyhal said. ""Missiles and drones hit 10 regions, where 18 facilities were damaged, most of them energy-related."" He said ""hundreds of settlements in seven regions"" had lost power and engineers were ""working at full capacity"" to repair the damage. Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched more than 50 cruise missiles into Ukraine on Monday, and said it had intercepted 44 of them. ""At 7:00 a.m. on October 31, the Russian occupiers launched several waves of missile attacks on critical infrastructure facilities in Ukraine,"" the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said. ""More than 50 X-101/X-555 cruise missiles were launched from the Tu-95/Tu-160 strategic aviation missile-carrying aircraft north of the Caspian Sea and the Volgodonsk region (Rostov region). 44 cruise missiles were destroyed"" by the Ukrainian military, the air force statement added. At least 10 Russian missiles were shot down over Kyiv early on Monday, regional police chief Andrii Nebytov said on Telegram. ""The police of the Kyiv region are now discovering debris from downed rockets of the occupiers in various areas of the region,"" he said. ""Air defense forces shot down at least 10 enemy missiles."" Oleksii Kuleba, head of Kyiv region military administration, said the strikes ""hit critical infrastructure targets"" and two people had been injured, one seriously. Monday's missiles were launched from Soviet-era Tupolev Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers that took off from Russia's Rostov region and over the Caspian Sea, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force Command said on television. Yurii Ihnat said there had been ""several waves of missile launches"" and repeated the claim that Ukraine had shot down ""a really high percentage."" Ihnat also appealed for more US and German air defenses in the wake of the attacks. ""We need air defense. Those systems that we have already mentioned, the (German-made) IRIS-T, we need more of them,"" he said. So far Germany has supplied Ukraine with one IRIS-T. ""This system works and it worked today, and worked with a 100% result,"" Ihnat said. ""And we want the Germans to increase production."" He also mentioned the US-made NASAMS system, which is due to be delivered, and older systems such as the US-made HAWK ground-to-air missile. Moscow defended the attacks. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Telegram Monday that it had targeted Ukraine's ""military command and energy systems."" ""The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continued strikes with high-precision, long-range air and sea-based weapons against Ukraine's military command and energy systems,"" it said. ""All assigned objects have been hit."" Kremlin says can't guarantee navigation safety after pulling out of grain deal In recent weeks, Russia has launched a barrage of attacks on Ukraine's power and heating infrastructure. Even before Monday's strikes, the situation was grave. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that about four million Ukrainians had power restrictions after attacks on energy infrastructure that day. Dmytro Sakharuk, executive director of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, said it's not possible to say how long outages will last following the latest strikes, while the necessary equipment to make repairs is also running low. Sakharuk told Ukrainian television: ""Unfortunately, we have already used up the stock of equipment that we had in our warehouses after the first two waves of attacks that have been taking place since October 10. We were able to purchase some equipment. But unfortunately, the cost of the equipment is now measured in hundreds of millions of dollars."" ""We are working on the ways to purchase it or get it from our partners. This is a problem for all power engineers. Cumulative losses as of yesterday are hundreds of millions of dollars for our company,"" he added. The assault on infrastructure is all part of a bigger plan by President Vladimir Putin, Melinda Haring, deputy director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council, told CNN last week. ""Putin's game plan is obvious: he wants to make this winter the coldest and darkest in Ukraine's history,"" she said. ""He will continue to strike infrastructure grids so as to knock out Ukraine's power and heat. His kamikaze drone attacks are meant to break the will of the Ukrainian people and to spark panic."" Some experts question how successful this strategy will be. Speaking to CNN, Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said: ""That Ukrainian air defences are successfully engaging some of the Russian cruise missiles being launched appears clear, what is less so are the claims regarding the exact numbers being intercepted, and the numbers getting through to the target. ""Conversely the number of air-launched cruise missiles that Russia still holds in its inventory has been reduced greatly, raising the question of how long it could continue to sustain such attacks."" Monday's attacks come after Russia suspended its participation in a United Nations-brokered grain deal viewed as key to addressing the global food shortage. Moscow announced it was leaving the deal on Saturday, blaming Ukraine for a drone attack on Crimea. Kyiv accused Russia of inventing ""fictitious terrorist attacks"" and using the deal as ""blackmail."" In a regular call with reporters on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Black Sea grain deal is ""risky"" and """,49,6.2174628898850575,4.466495529053733,1.750967360831324,25

The second annual ""summit"" to counter ransomware will take a hard look at virtual currencies that facilitate cybercriminal profits and additional ways that companies and governments can fortify themselves against hacks, a senior administration official told reporters. The summit comes as a major US hospital network, CommonSpirit, continues to recover from a ransomware attack that has cut off some health providers' access to electronic health records. A separate ransomware attack over Labor Day weekend disrupted the computer systems of the Los Angeles Unified School District, one of the largest in the US. ""We're seeing the pace and the sophistication of the ransomware attacks increasing faster than our resilience and disruption efforts,"" the official said. FBI Director Christopher Wray, along with Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, will this week brief the visiting delegations on ransomware issues, according to the senior administration official. Canada, Singapore, Ukraine and the UK are among the many governments expected to participate. The summit will begin with a briefing from US intelligence and security agencies that highlights 4,000 cyberattacks in countries around the world over the last 18 months, the senior administration official said. Russia, where analysts believe many ransomware gangs find refuge, will be notably absent from the US-backed ransomware discussions for the second year in a row. In January, Russian authorities arrested the person whom US officials believed was behind the ransomware attack on a major US fuel pipeline operator last year. But Russia's February invasion of Ukraine has dampened hopes of any substantive cooperation on cybercrime between Washington and Moscow. Despite Russia's absence, the governments will address issues that implicate Moscow. That includes ""how we as a set of countries make it harder, costlier and riskier for ransomware actors to operate,"" the senior administration official said. This year, big tech firms such as Microsoft and SAP — which often have more data on cyberattacks than some government agencies — will also take part in the summit.",20,6.75253086184386,4.527050345648455,2.2254805161954057,2

The rocket carried 11 different experiments designed to test and collect data for hypersonic weapons research to support the joint Army-Navy program, the Navy said. This was the second test carried out under the program focused on developing both sea and land-based hypersonic capabilities. The first test was conducted in October 2021. In this test, a sounding rocket was fired from the launchpad, carrying out different experiments to gather data and collect information on components of hypersonic missiles, including heat-resistant materials and high-end electronics. ""The launch today went extremely well,"" said Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, the director of Strategic Systems Programs who oversaw the test. ""As a matter of fact, we've just gotten done looking through our key observables, and every piece of data that we wanted to collect - at least preliminarily - has shown that we collected all that data."" A second rocket is scheduled for launch on Thursday and will carry out an additional 13 experiments designed to inform hypersonic weapons development, the Navy said. The data collected from these tests will help in the development of the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic system and the Army's Long Range Hypersonic Weapon. The two programs will both use the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, a projectile carried atop a booster rocket that coasts towards its target at speeds greater than Mach 5. Hypersonic weapons travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, or approximately 4,000 miles per hour, making them difficult to detect and intercept in time. The missiles can also maneuver and vary altitude, allowing them to evade missile defense systems. The Pentagon has made the development of hypersonic weapons one of its top priorities after China conducted successful hypersonic launches last year and Russia has begun to use hypersonic missiles in its war in Ukraine. After China tested a hypersonic weapon in 2021, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley called the test ""a very significant technological event"" that is just one element of China's military capabilities. ""The Chinese military capabilities are much greater than that"" single test, Milley said in October 2021.

Norway's police told NRK that the man, a researcher at the university, claims to be a Brazilian citizen but they suspect he could be using a false identity and could actually be a Russian citizen. ""We have asked that a Brazilian researcher at the University of Tromsø be expelled from Norway as we believe he represents a threat to fundamental national interests,"" said Hedvig Moe, Assistant Head, Norwegian Police Security Service, speaking to NRK. ""PST (Norwegian Police Security Service) is worried that he may have acquired a network and information about Norwegian politics of the northern area. Even if this network or the information gathered bit by bit is not a threat to the security of the kingdom, we are worried that the information could be misused by Russia,"" Moe added. CNN has reached out to the police force for comment. The agency did not reveal the man's name but said on its Twitter account that he was being held on suspicion of violating two sections of the Norwegian penal code, dealing with ""illegal intelligence"" that could ""damage fundamental national interests"" and ""security interests of other states."" PST said it was working closely with other countries' intelligence agencies as they work on the case. Russian authorities have yet to comment on the arrest but in an email to NRK the Russian embassy said they were not aware of the circumstances of the case and described it as part of the ""spy mania"" in Norway, where ""everything Russian ... is suspicious and smells of espionage."" The public broadcaster said the case is being treated as an immigration case, and the man's lawyer said he opposes the detention and ""does not agree with the basis for it."" He said he'd received ""very little concrete information on the case so far."" In July, Richard Moore, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence service MI6, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, European countries have expelled ""north of 400 Russian intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover"" across the bloc. The country has been on edge after a series of leaks in two Russian gas pipelines -- both of which run under the Baltic Sea near Sweden and Denmark -- that leaders of several countries said were the likely result of sabotage.

""18 enemy cruise missiles were destroyed by aviation, anti-aircraft missile units and mobile fire groups,"" a post from the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said. ""In addition, the Russians attacked from ships in the Black Sea with Kalibr cruise missiles. A total of 16 starts,"" it continued. CNN cannot independently confirm the Ukrainian military's claims. Several rockets flying towards Kyiv on Saturday were shot down by air defense forces in the region, the city's Mayor Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said in a separate statement. A series of attacks across Ukraine Saturday left residents in parts of Odesa, Cherkasy, Kropyvnitsky, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Lutsk without electricity, according to officials in each region. The scale of the damage brought on Western Ukrainian power facilities is similar -- or could be worse -- than the effect of Russian attacks earlier in the month from October 10-12, the state-owned electricity transmission company Ukrenergo said. Russia has launched a series of attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks, striking civilian infrastructure and sowing terror in Ukrainian cities far from the frontlines of the war. The attacks have increased since the summer when, according to the United States and Kyiv, Moscow acquired suicide drones from Iran. On Friday, France called for a United Nations investigation into whether drones used in the attacks are being supplied by Tehran. ""We expect the UN experts to go on the ground and to collect the remains of these drones and to tell us where they are coming from. This is part of their mandate, they report twice a year and it has to be done,"" France's Ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Rivière, told reporters in New York on Friday. Iran's Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian on Saturday denied US and Western allegations of Iran having supplied drones to Russia to use against Ukraine, according to Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency. ""We condemn the allegations of giving drones to Russia in the Ukraine war. We are against war anywhere in the world,"" Abdollahian said following his meeting with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in Yerevan. Previously Iran has accused the West of running a disinformation campaign against it. Russia has also denied using Iranian drones, saying such claims are ""unsubstantiated inferences"" and ""far-fetched assumptions."" The French ambassador dismissed these denials, saying ""nobody is paying any attention to them"" and that ""the facts are crystal clear."" France views Russia's use of drones in Ukraine as ""a massive violation of international humanitarian law and international law,"" he added, saying that it also went against a UN resolution on Iran's nuclear program. His comments came after a UN Security Council meeting on the situation in Ukraine, held following requests by France and Mexico. CNN reported Tuesday that Iran has sent military personnel to Russian-occupied territory inside Crimea to train and advise the Russian military on the use of their drones, according to two sources familiar with US intelligence. Suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a loitering munition because they are capable of waiting for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only strike once an enemy asset is identified. They are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance. Ukrainian authorities say Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran and that it is rebranding and using the Shaheds under the name of ""Geran."" US officials say there has been ""some evidence already"" that the Iranian drones have ""experienced numerous failures"" on the battlefield. De Rivière, the French ambassador, said Moscow was changing its tactics and targeting civilian infrastructure because ""the Russian army is clearly in trouble on the ground."" ""Therefore, Russia has decided to increase its pressure on Ukrainian civilians to destroy energy facilities, hospitals, schools. Many cities in Ukraine have been targeted by the Russian artillery. This must clearly stop. ""So this is where we are, we need to talk, we need to discuss, we need to put this war to an end,"" de Rivière said, ""and the sooner, the better."" Attacks across Ukraine Just hours later, on Saturday, nearly 1,000 homes in the southern Ukrainian town of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk region were left without electricity after Russian shelling during the night severed power lines, according to governor Valentin Reznichenko. The city of Khmelnytskyi in western Ukraine also reported losing power, folllowing a series of explosions. Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation said air sirens were activated across the country, in all regions except Russian-annexed Crimea. The governor of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine said rockets had been seen overhead ""probably on [their way] to western and central Ukraine."" The governor of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine also warned residents of the ""threat of a rocket strike."" And in western Ukraine, the head of the Khmelnytskyi regional military urged residents to stay indoors amid reports of explosions.

""Iranian military personnel were on the ground in Crimea and assisted with these operations,"" he said. ""Russia has received dozens of UAVs so far and will likely continue to receive additional shipments in the future."" The US has said before that Russia was obtaining drones from Iran, but has not previously disclosed that Iranian personnel are on the ground assisting in using the weapons. Kirby said it was a ""relatively small number"" of Iranian personnel on the ground. ""Tehran is now directly engaged on the ground and through the provision of weapons that are impacting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, that are killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in Ukraine,"" he said. He said the Russians weren't familiar with the use of the drones, and needed help from the Iranian personnel to use them. He said the US is now concerned that Russia is seeking to acquire additional weapons, including surface-to-surface missiles, from Iran.

""The United States began warning in July that Iran was planning to transfer UAVs to Russia for use in Russia's brutal war against Ukraine, and we now have abundant evidence that these UAVs are being used to strike Ukrainian civilians and critical civilian infrastructure,"" Price said in a statement. The United Nations Security Council received expert briefings on Iran's transfer of such drones to Russia, Price said, and the issue was collectively raised by the US, United Kingdom and France at a closed-door UNSC meeting Wednesday. Drones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired the drones from Iran. Iran has denied supplying weapons to Russia despite evidence to the contrary. CNN reported Tuesday that Iran has sent military personnel to Russian-occupied territory inside Crimea to train and advise the Russian military on the use of their drones, according to two sources familiar with US intelligence. A spokesman for the Iranian mission at the United Nations said, ""Iran does not confirm this claim and rejects it."" Iran's UN Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani denied his country supplied Russia with drones for use in Ukraine and told reporters the West was running a disinformation campaign against Iran. ""Iran categorically rejected unfounded and unsubstantiated claims that Iran has transferred UAVs for the use (in) the conflict in Ukraine,"" Iravani said during a news conference from New York. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Thursday that reports Russia is using Iranian UAVs are ""unsubstantiated inferences"" and ""far-fetched assumptions,"" despite ample evidence of their use in Ukraine. Still, the US has said there will be consequences for these Iranian drone transfers to Russia, and Price dangled the possibility of sanctions being rolled out. ""We will not hesitate to use our sanctions and other appropriate tools on all involved in these transfers,"" he said. Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a loitering munition because they are capable of waiting for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only strike once an enemy asset is identified. They are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance.",49,1.32048122087535,3.0922892537473015,-1.7718080328719514,11

""These people loved life,"" Anna Petrukova said of Victoria Zamchenko and her husband Bohdan, both 34, who she described as a ""wonderful couple."" ""They had a lot of plans -- they dreamed of their own home, children, a full-fledged family, travel. They had very big plans for this life,"" Petrukova said. The Zamchenkos died at home in their apartment in Kyiv on Monday, following a barrage of strikes by Russian-launched, Iranian-made ""kamikaze"" drones, according to Ukrainian officials. Victoria Zamchenko was six months pregnant with the couple's first child. Drones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since Moscow acquired new drones from Iran over the summer. Unlike more traditional, larger and faster military drones that return to base after dropping missiles, ""kamikaze"" drones are designed to crash into a target and explode, detonating their warhead and destroying the drones in the process. The Ukrainian military and US intelligence say Russia is using Iranian-made attack drones. US officials told CNN in July that Iran had begun showcasing Shahed series drones to Russia at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran the previous month. In August, US officials said Russia had bought these drones and was training its forces how to use them. According to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran. 'Yin and yang' The Zamchenkos were among at least five people killed in the Russian drone attacks on Kyiv Monday, which sent shock waves through the Ukrainian capital, damaging residential buildings and burying civilians under rubble. At least three people died in separate strikes on Tuesday. Petrukova, who was in phone contact with Victoria Zamchenko just minutes before her death, said the first drone strikes Monday had trapped the couple in their apartment. ""They could no longer leave the house because there was an incoming hit at the [thermal power plant] right opposite,"" Petrukova recalled. ""So they were sitting in the corridor."" ""The last message from her was at 8:18 a.m. [when] she heard two more incoming hits. After that, obviously, there was a fifth one. And the connection with her was lost."" Petrukova added that the couple had been considering leaving the city, after the windows of their apartment were blown out in an attack last week. Victoria Zamchenko had returned to Kyiv in August from her home city of Rinve in western Ukraine. She had missed her work as a sommelier at a local wine shop, Petrukova said. ""She was cheerful, highly intelligent, soulful, funny, deep kind of person,"" Petrukova said of her friend. ""We always had something to talk about and something to be silent about."" Together since their university days, the Zamchenkos were ""inseparable,"" like ""yin and yang,"" Petrukova said. ""It is impossible to imagine them separately. They always held hands, always hugged. There was a lot of tenderness and warmth between them. It was always a pleasure to be around them. They were fun people.""",49,2.038417778680869,2.48160612664064,-0.4431883479597709,11

The death toll in Kyiv continues to climb this week, officials said. At least five people were killed Monday following Russian attacks with Iranian-made ""kamikaze"" drones and at least three people died in separate strikes on Tuesday. 'Save water as much as possible' Moscow has targeted key Ukrainian power facilities in recent days, leaving areas in at least three cities without power. A residential neighborhood in the capital Kyiv is experiencing power cuts and water outages, local energy company DTEK said on Facebook Tuesday. ""Russian shelling has damaged a critical infrastructure facility in the Desnyansky district, causing interruptions in the electricity supply to the residents of the Troyeshchyna residential district and the water channel that supplies water to the Left Bank of the capital,"" the company said. In Dnipropetrovsk region, at least three areas, including parts of Dnipro city, experienced electrical outages and a water pumping facility lost power after Russia launched two missiles at an energy facility, causing ""fire and severe destruction,"" according to local authorities. A CNN team in Dnipro saw from a distance the aftermath of a hit on a power plant in Dnipro and smoke rising from the facility. Further west, the mayor of Zhytomyr said in a statement that the city was experiencing power and water cuts, with hospitals running on back up energy. Residents in the Ukrainian capital were also urged by local officials to limit electricity and water usage, after two key infrastructure complexes were hit on Tuesday. ""Currently, the provision of electricity and water supply services is partially limited in many houses on the left bank of the capital ...

Russia has launched many of what is believed to be a store of hundreds of Iranian-made drones from Crimea in a fusillade that has targeted Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure in increasing numbers in recent weeks. The drones have been seen as a signal of growing closeness between Tehran and Moscow. A spokesman for the Iranian mission at the United Nations said ""Iran does not confirm this claim and rejects it."" State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Tuesday that the ""deepening"" of relations between Moscow and Tehran should be seen as ""a profound threat."" The Daily Mirror first reported the trainers' presence in Ukraine. It was not immediately clear how many trainers traveled to Crimea and whether they remain present. One source briefed on US intelligence said ""dozens"" of Iranian personnel had been sent. US officials have said that when Russia first began testing and deploying the drones in Ukraine in August, many of them experienced numerous failures. Russian operatives had been training on the systems inside Iran, but Iranian personnel began traveling to Crimea in recent weeks to help Russia operate the systems and try to fix their problems. Tehran has provided two types: Shaheds, which explode on impact and have a range of upwards of 1,000 miles, and the Mohajer-6, which can both carry missiles and be used for surveillance. US officials have seen Russia's reliance on these Iranian drones — in particular the Shaheds — as evidence that Russia is struggling to replenish its native stocks of munitions after eight months of missile salvos and a punishing regime of Western sanctions that the US believes has cut Moscow off from needed components for new weapons. Iran has denied sending the drones to Russia. Patel said that the United States would ""continue to take practical, aggressive steps to make these weapons sales harder, including sanctions, export control actions against any entities involved."" A US official told CNN that on Wednesday, the US, France and the United Kingdom plan to discuss Iran's drone transfers to Russia during a closed UN Security Council meeting. The US, France, and the UK have said that the transfer of the Iranian-made drones to Russia violates UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which restricts certain arms transfers to or from Iran.

2022-10-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/europe/russia-ukraine-belarus-troops-intl-cmd/index.html,"Ukraine looks anxiously towards its northern border, and a fresh influx of Russian troops into Belarus","The announcement last week by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko that his country and Russia would form a joint regional force and carry out exercises set off alarm bells in Kyiv. The last time Belarusian and Russian forces held joint exercises, in February, many of those Russian forces went on to cross the Ukrainian border in their ill-fated drive towards the capital. It's not that Belarus has a mighty army -- it doesn't. But the prospect of Ukraine's long northern border becoming a passageway for Russian forces for the second time this year would be a nightmare for Ukraine's already stretched forces. Ukraine and Belarus share a 1,000-kilometer frontier, much of it sparsely populated and thickly forested. The first group of Russian soldiers to join the new force with Belarusian troops arrived in Belarus Saturday, Minsk's defense ministry said. Altogether, the Russian contingent will be less than 9,000 people, according to the head of the Belarus Department of International Military Cooperation, Valery Revenko. At the moment, the Ukrainian army is conducting offensives in the east and south while holding off Russian forces in parts of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. After seven months of war, the Ukrainian military has suffered attrition just like its enemy: moving forces to defend its northern flank would stretch forces already fighting on multiple fronts. Predictably enough, Belarus says the joint force is purely defensive. The country's Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said that ""all activities carried out at the moment are aimed at providing a sufficient response to activities near our borders."" Those activities, according to Belarus, are aimed at deterring Ukrainian preparations to attack the country. Lukashenko said last week that his government had been ""warned about strikes against Belarus from the territory of Ukraine."" Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei followed up Friday, saying an anti-terrorist operation was underway ""amid reports of impending provocations by nearby states."" Ukraine has vehemently denied the claims. The Foreign Ministry said it ""categorically rejects these latest insinuations by the Belarusian regime. We cannot rule out that this diplomatic note may be part of a provocation on the part of the Russian Federation."" President Volodymyr Zelensky told a meeting of the G7 group of the world's advanced economies last week that UN peacekeepers should be sent to the border. ""Russia is trying to directly draw Belarus into this war,"" Zelensky told the G7. There's certainly been much more movement of military hardware on the railways of Belarus. Social media videos have shown multiple rail convoys of tanks and other equipment moving across the country. The markings on one convoy were from the Moscow military region. Analysts think it's probable that much of this hardware belongs to Russia and is being retrieved from stocks in Belarus to make up for the losses Russian forces have suffered in Ukraine, especially last month. Less likely: that this spasm of activity indicates that Belarus is preparing to enter the fray. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last week the US had not seen indications that Belarusian troops ""are preparing to go in or will go in ... Any additional troops under Russian command is something to be concerned about, but we're just not there yet."" Despite often bombastic rhetoric, Lukashenko has not committed his forces to Russia's Special Military Operation, and most analysts believe that even if he did it would make little difference. Konrad Muzyka, an independent defense analyst based in Poland, follows the Belarus military closely and believes they are ""relatively weak."" Muzyka said on Twitter: ""The Belarusian Armed Forces are largely a mobilizational force. Their manpower is at around 50-60% of the required peacetime strength."" To reach full strength, they'd need to mobilize at least 20,000 men, Muzyka added. That would be a warning sign. But Lukashenko repeated last week that Belarus was not planning to announce any mobilization. Unlike Russian forces, the Belarus military rarely conducts exercises above battalion level. But it has had a high level of exercises this year; another was announced last week. Serhii Naiev, the commanding officer of Ukraine's Joint Forces, said last week: ""That is another demonstration of their readiness and an artificial increase in the level of tension."" Analyst Muzyka imagines three scenarios: the exercises are designed to prepare for an attack by NATO states; they aim to tie up Ukrainian forces along the border; or are preparations for an assault on Ukraine. The first is not going to happen; the last option would be immensely unpopular in Belarus, where there is nowhere near the level of animosity towards Ukraine that has been whipped up in Russia. But it's in Moscow's interests that the Ukrainians worry about their northern border, not least because of its proximity to Kyiv. Naiev says Belarus is already important for Russian missile stacks. Ukraine estimates there are four ballistic missile systems there and 12 S-400 surface-to-air systems, and some Iranian-made drones came from the north last week. More Russian combat planes have also begun arriving in Belarus, according to the Belarusian Defense Ministry. Ukrainian officials estimate there are as few as 1,000 Russian troops in Belarus at the moment. But a surge would ""create a threat of a repeated offensive in the Northern operational zone, in particular on the city of Kyiv,"" Naiev said. Despite the recent partial mobilization in Russia, the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) believes the Russian military is -- at the moment -- incapable of forming another phalanx to attack Ukraine from the north. ""Russian forces continue to attrit their own combat capabilities as they impale themselves on attempts to capture tiny villages in Donbas and simply do not have the combat-effective mechanized troops available to supplement a Belarusian incursion into northern Ukraine,"" the ISW said Friday Lukashenko has trodden a fine line throughout the conflict -- supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""special military operation"" without committing his own troops. Last week, he said, ""We are participating (in the operation). We do not hide it. But we are not killing anyone. We are not sending our military anywhere. We do not violate our obligations."" However, his room for maneuver may be shrinking. The mass protests that erupted after his disputed re-election in 2020 left Lukashenko ever more reliant on Moscow. As the Kremlin's need for some ""wins"" in Ukraine becomes more urgent, its ally to the west may find itself under growing pressure to collaborate. But at the same time, Lukashenko will want to avoid the risk of his untested troops getting mauled in Ukraine as he is vulnerable to further domestic unrest if his security forces are distracted or weakened.",7,5.099133868647557,5.48318778332348,-0.3840539146759232,16

Four people were injured in the attacks and 19 people trapped under the destruction have been rescued, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior official working for Ukraine's president. The strikes on Kyiv appear to be part of a wider assault involving drones and cruise missiles aimed at critical infrastructure, especially power sources. The Ukrainian Air Force said it had destroyed 37 Iranian-made kamikaze drones and three cruise missiles in the south and east of the country early Monday. Ukraine Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi said that security forces were able to shoot down 36 of 42 drones that Russia launched on Monday. Around 30 of the drones targeted Kyiv, Monastyrskyi said on Ukrainian television. Fresh attacks in the eastern regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy targeted crucial infrastructure. Three people in Sumy were killed by rockets, nine were wounded and 1,625 were left without power, a local military official said. Energy infrastructure was damaged in central and northern regions of Ukraine, but the power grid was ""under control,"" the state energy utility Ukrenergo said in a statement on Facebook. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal asked citizens to reduce power consumption, especially during peak hours, to help stabilize the country's electricity system. In Kyiv, blasts were heard as early as 6:45 a.m. local time, including one in the city's Shevchenkivskyi district. Kyiv was hit five times, Shmyhal said. One of the strikes hit close to Kyiv's main train station, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs. Authorities have asked people to stay indoors. Later on Monday, officials said Kyiv region's air defense was actively responding to another Russian drone attack. ""Air defense system is working above our city so I strongly recommend everyone to stay in shelters,"" Volodymyr Borysenko, the mayor of Boryspil, which is on the outskirts of city, said on Facebook. ""Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said. ""The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us. The occupiers will get only fair punishment and condemnation of future generations. And we will get victory."" Russia's Defense Ministry on Monday said it had launched high-precision weapons at military energy targets across Ukraine aimed military and energy targets. Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are small, portable aerial weapon systems that are hard to detect and can be fired at a distance. They can be easily launched and are designed to hit behind enemy lines and be destroyed in the attack. One of the people killed in the capital was a woman who was six months pregnant, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a statement. Klitschko also told CNN's Clarissa Ward that Russian forces were targeting infrastructure to ""switch off the electricity"" ahead of the winter months. 'A flash and an explosion' Vitalii, a Kyiv man in his 20s, witnessed one attack after he had just arrived at a railway station. ""We saw a flash and an explosion. We went to the basement,"" said Vitalii, who declined to give last name for safety reasons. Vitalii and others sought shelter for about two hours. When the coast appeared clear, they attempted to leave -- only to see another blast. Vitalii said he and others recognized the triangular shape of the Iranian-made drone and how it buzzed. ""There was another explosion,"" he said. ""Everyone went back to the basement. People were running, screaming. There was panic. People were scared because they didn't understand what was going on."" Once the situation eventually calmed after the second blast, Vitali took a taxi and left. Monday's assault comes a week after Russia began an intense, two-day nationwide bombardment of Ukraine that killed at least 19 people and leveled civilian targets, drawing global outrage. The strikes also caused major damage to power systems across Ukraine, forcing people to reduce consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said there was no need for more ""massive"" strikes for now. However, a series of Russian attacks over the weekend killed 11 civilians -- eight in the eastern region of Donetsk, two in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and one in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. The city of Zaporizhzhia was attacked with kamikaze drones and missiles on Saturday, while Kyiv was hit by an apparent Russian rocket.",47,4.078148409423166,2.73495351617588,1.3431948932472864,25
2022-10-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/politics/us-air-defense-ukraine-drone-attacks/index.html,US trying to speed up delivery of key air defense systems to Ukraine after Russia's Iranian-supplied drone attacks,"The US Defense Department is trying to speed up the delivery of two advanced surface-to-air missile systems to Ukraine as Russia has increasingly used Iranian-supplied drones that explode on impact to pummel Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. The Pentagon's effort is just the latest evidence of a newly urgent push by the US and its allies to help Ukraine build a comprehensive air and missile defense system to protect itself against these drones, which killed four in an attack on Kyiv on Monday. The drones have become an increasingly urgent problem for Ukraine, and one that has drawn US condemnation. The State Department on Monday said that the drones are a violation of a UN Security Council resolution which restricts certain arms transfers to or from Iran. With its reserves of precision munitions believed to be running low, Moscow has turned to these loitering drones to maintain its ability to strike high-value targets — and terrorize Ukrainian cities — from afar, Western analysts say. In recent days, they have been used to strike energy infrastructure. Unlike more traditional, larger and faster military drones that return to base after dropping missiles, the Iranian-supplied drones are designed to crash into a target and explode, detonating their warhead and destroying the drones in the process. They are smaller and more easily controlled than cruise missiles. The US doesn't know exactly how many drones Iran has provided to Russia, but military analysts say the number is clearly substantial. Russia fired 43 on Monday alone, with 37 shot down by air defense systems, according to Ukraine's Air Force. One US defense official estimated the total number to be in the hundreds. ""The big effect is definitely economic exhaustion, attacking Ukraine's electricity availability going into the winter and also keeping the war nationwide,"" said Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses. ""They're essentially using these drones as sort of a poor man's precision guided weapon against Ukrainian infrastructure."" A US defense official told CNN Monday that the Pentagon is now trying to accelerate the delivery of two National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS —systems owned by 12 nations and already used to protect Washington, DC. The US has already committed eight NASAMS to Ukraine including the two being accelerated, according to Pentagon officials. The US first announced it would send two NASAMs to Ukraine on July 1 in a Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package of military assistance and announced it would send six more on August 24. The systems are currently being manufactured by Raytheon in a joint partnership with Norway's Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace, according to the Pentagon. The US now is hoping to complete manufacturing two of the systems by the end of October or early November -- perhaps as much as a full month sooner than originally slated. Once the systems are completed, they must still be transported to Ukraine. The NASAMS will be flown to a nearby country and then shipped over land into Ukraine. Drone attacks reflect Russian weakness Even as they remain deeply concerned about the success Russia has had with the Iranian drones, sources familiar with the intelligence and Western military analysts say that their heavy usage reflects a weakness in Russia's arsenal. Western officials believe that Russia is running low on its precision guided munitions, and, according to one source familiar with Western intelligence, is likely on the brink of dipping into its strategic reserves to continue the war. Later on Monday the top US spy chief said Russia has been firing its precision munitions ""at an unsustainable rate,"" leaving them reliant on lower-end weapons and technological band-aids that ""are probably leading to weapons and systems that are less capable."" ""Russia entered the war with prodigious stocks of munitions, but it has been firing them at an unsustainable rate,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told an intelligence conference in Washington. ""This is especially true for high-end precision weapons such as cruise missiles they use in strikes on Ukraine's electric grid and other targets. In short, they're running through their stocks."" Meanwhile, Haines said, US sanctions and export controls have helped contribute to ""major supply shortages in Ukraine,"" forcing Russia to turn to Iran and North Korea, as well as rely on makeshift solutions. ""Export controls have forced Russia to rely on contraband chips where it can and to frankly jury rig microelectronic components when no alternatives exist — steps that are probably leading to weapons and systems that are less capable,"" she said. Russia still has plenty of older, less precise Soviet weapons, the source familiar with Western intelligence said -- although it's not clear how much of the old Soviet stockpiles Moscow has managed to bring to the fight because the West doesn't know how many were sold or stripped for parts after the Cold War. Still, Ukraine remains deeply vulnerable to attack from the air. At a meeting of allied defense chiefs focused on Ukrainian aid last week, US Chairman of the Joint chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said that the US and its allies should contribute air defense systems they have and then help Ukraine knit the systems together to create a comprehensive defense. ""Many countries have other systems, there's a whole series of Israeli systems that are quite capable. The Germans have systems as we mentioned, so a lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems,"" Milley said. Milley suggested if multiple countries send the air defense systems they have, Ukrainians can ""link"" them together ""with a command and control and communication systems.""",49,3.82399607424093,2.4907219128111646,1.3332741614297654,21

Here's what we know,"Russia has launched a series of ""kamikaze"" drone attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks, striking civilian infrastructure and sowing terror in Ukrainian cities far from the frontlines of the war. The Ukrainian government says Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and other cities have suffered a barrage of drone attacks, and pleaded with Western countries to step up their assistance in the face of the new challenge. Drones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since Moscow acquired new drones from Iran over the summer. The Ukrainians themselves have been using kamikaze drones to strike against Russian targets -- and asked their allies to supply them with more of these deadly weapons. Here's what we know about these drones. What are kamikaze drones? Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a ""loitering munition"" because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified. They are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance. The name ""kamikaze"" refers to the fact the drones are disposable. Unlike more traditional, larger and faster military drones that return to base after dropping missiles, kamikaze drones are designed to crash into a target and explode, detonating their warhead and destroying the drones in the process. They are smaller and more easily controlled than cruise missiles. Which drones is Russia using in Ukraine? The Ukrainian military and US intelligence say Russia is using Iranian-made attack drones. US officials told CNN in July that Iran had begun showcasing Shahed series drones to Russia at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran the previous month. In August, US officials said Russia had bought these drones and was training its forces how to use them. According to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran. Iran has denied supplying weapons to Russia despite evidence to the contrary. Iranian Foreign Minister Spokesman Nasser Kanaani was quoted by the state news agency IRNA on Monday as saying ""Iran has repeatedly declared that it is not a party in the war between Russia and Ukraine and has not sent any weapons to either side."" But Ukraine claimed its forces had shot down one of these drones for the first time last month near the city of Kupyansk in Kharkiv. There have been more reported attacks since then. Kyiv's military said Wednesday it had downed 17 Shahed-136 drones that day alone. According to photos released by Ukrainian authorities, Russia has rebranded the Shaheds and is using them under the name of ""Geran."" US officials say there has been ""some evidence already"" that the Iranian drones ""have already experienced numerous failures"" on the battlefield. US Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Sasha Baker told reporters late last month that ""the idea that they represent some technological leap ahead, frankly we're just not seeing borne out in the data."" Moscow also has its own kamikaze drones, made by the Russian weapons manufacturer Kalashnikov Concern. Ukraine claimed on Wednesday it had shot down two of these ZALA Lancet drones that day. How much damage can the drones cause? While relatively small, the Shahed drones are capable of carrying missiles and have a payload of approximately 50 kilograms (110 pounds). That means they can inflicted significant damage. Retired Australian Army Major General Mick Ryan told CNN the drones are ""generally of limited utility against military targets that require precision."" ""So the Russians are using these fairly unsophisticated drones against large targets like cities. As you mention there is no military utility to these attacks, this is about Putin satisfying hardliners in Russia they were in ecstasy last week after the missile attacks and probably will be after these ones,"" he said. Drone attacks can have major impact on the civilian population. Zelensky accused Moscow of using them to spread terror among civilians. ""All night and all morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population. Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine,"" he said Monday. As air raid sirens rang through the capital city, many people spent hours hiding in basements, underground stations and bomb shelters, while schools returned to online education. In a statement last week, the International Red Cross denounced the use of the drones, saying the use of explosive weapons in populated areas causes mental and psychological harm as well as life-threatening injuries. How can Ukraine defend itself against these drones? Ukraine has been asking its allies for air defense systems since the beginning of the war in February, but the need has become more urgent since Russia started using the Iranian-made drones. Air defense systems were one of the top three priorities on a Ukrainian weapons wish list presented during a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, according to a handout provided to defense ministers participating in the gathering. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters after the meeting on Wednesday that the US and its allies needed to provide Ukraine with air defense systems in order for Ukraine to help defend its airspace against incoming attacks from Russian forces. ""Many countries have Patriot, many countries have other systems, there's a whole series of Israeli systems that are quite capable, the Germans have systems as we mentioned, so a lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems,"" Milley said. ""The task will be to bring those together, get them deployed, get them trained, because each of these systems is different, make sure they can link together with a command and control and communication systems and make sure they have radars that can talk to each other so they can acquire targets on the inbound flights."" The air defenses Ukraine needs to combat kamikaze drones are different from the systems that are used against cruise missiles and similar weapons. The Patriot air defense missile system -- which stands for ""Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target"" -- is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, as well as advanced aircraft and cruise missiles, and could be used against drones. Ukrainian officials said that Ukrainian air defense forces were already taking down the ""bulk"" of the Shahed drones. Ukraine's senior military commander, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, tweeted Tuesday his thanks to Poland as ""brothers in arms"" for training an air defense battalion that he said had destroyed nine of 11 Shaheds. He said Poland had given Ukraine ""systems"" to help destroy the drones. Last month there were reports that the Polish government had bought advanced Israeli equipment (Israel has a policy of not selling ""advanced defensive technology"" to Kyiv) and was then transferring it to Ukraine. Zelensky made another plea for more air defense capacities on Thursday, saying Kyiv has only about 10% of what it needs to combat Moscow's attacks. Does Ukraine have kamikaze drones too? The Ukrainian military has been using RAM II kamikaze drones, which were developed by a consortium of Ukrainian companies and bought with money crowdfunded by ordinary Ukrainians. These precision-guided loitering munitions can carry 3 kilogram (6.6 pound) warheads and have a flight range of up to 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), according to the manufacturers. But Kyiv has also been relying on its allies for drone supplies. The US has sent several types of aerial weapon systems to Ukraine. These include Switchblade drones -- small, portable kamikaze drones that can carry a warhead and detonate on impact. The Switchblade 300 and the larger Switchblade 600 are produced by American defense company AeroVironment. The smaller Switchblade 300 can hit a target up to 6 miles away (9.6 kilometers), according to specifications provided by the company, while the larger Switchblade 600 can strike more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Both systems can be set up and launched within minutes. In May, the US sent the Ukrainian military ""phoenix ghost"" drones, which are believed to be similar to Switchblade, although little is known about their capabilities. The UK has also provided Ukraine with loitering munitions, including 850 hand-launched Black Hornet micro-drones. Ukraine has also been using Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones. These have become something of a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance. However, these are larger and designed to return home after dropping laser-guided bombs or missiles.",49,1.2513752206366737,5.119092665948132,-3.8677174453114587,11

The denial, reportedly made in a phone call between Iran's Foreign Minister and his Portuguese counterpart on Friday, follows claims by Kyiv and US intelligence that Russia is using Iranian-made ""kamikaze drones"" in its attacks on Ukrainian territory. The Iranian government said its Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian emphasized in the call ""once again"" that Tehran ""has not and will not"" provide any weapon to be used in the Ukraine war. ""We believe that the arming of each side of the crisis will prolong the war, so we have not considered and do not consider war to be the right way either in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria or Yemen,"" Amir-Abdollahian said, according to an Iranian readout of the call. The Portuguese government said its Foreign Minister João Gomes Cravinho had expressed concerns about the ""recently reported evidence on the use of Iranian drones by the Russian Federation in Ukrainian territory"" and ""stressed the need for the Iranian authorities to ensure that this equipment is not supplied to Russia."" Ukrainian authorities say Russia has used Iranian-supplied kamikaze drones in strikes against Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and other cities in recent weeks, and has pleaded with Western countries to step up their assistance in the face of the new challenge. The Ukrainians themselves have been using kamikaze drones to strike against Russian targets. A key weapon Drones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired the drones from Iran. On Saturday, just hours after the call between the foreign ministers, the Ukrainian military said the city of Zaporizhzhia had been hit by four kamikaze drone strikes overnight. Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a loitering munition because they are capable of waiting for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only strike once an enemy asset is identified. They are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance.

2022-10-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/15/europe/russian-general-surovikin-profile-intl-cmd/index.html,'They hated him.' Former subordinate recalls serving under Russia's new top commander in Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's devastating war on Ukraine is faltering. Now, there's a new general in charge -- with a reputation for brutality. After Ukraine recently recaptured more territory than Russia's army took in the last six months, Russia's Ministry of Defense last Saturday named Sergey Surovikin as its new overall commander for operations in the war. Notably, he previously played an instrumental role in Russia's operations in Syria -- during which Russian combat aircraft caused widespread devastation in rebel-held areas - as Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces. CNN spoke to a former Russian air force lieutenant, Gleb Irisov, who served under him in Syria. He said Surovikin was ""very close to Putin's regime"" and ""never had any political ambitions, so always executed a plan exactly as ​the government wanted."" Analysts say Surovikin's appointment is highly unlikely to change how Russian forces are carrying out the war but that it speaks to Putin's dissatisfaction with previous command operations. It is also, in part, likely meant to ""mollify"" the nationalist and pro-war base within Russia itself, according to Mason Clark, Russia Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think-tank. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has called for Russia to ""take more drastic measures​"" ​including the use of ""low-yield nuclear weapons"" in Ukraine following recent setbacks, welcomed the appointment of Surovikin, who first saw service in Afghanistan in the 1980s before commanding a unit in the Second Chechen War ​in 2004. Praise from Kadyrov, who is ​a key Putin ally, is significant, perhaps, as he himself is notorious for crushing all forms of dissent. ""I personally ​have know​n Sergei very well for almost 15 years. I can definitely say he is a real general and warrior, experienced, headstrong and foresighted commander who always takes patriotism, honor and respect above all,"" Kadyrov posted on social media, following news of Surovikin's appointment last Saturday. ""The united army group is now in safe hands,"" he added. 'They hated him' Irisov, Surovikin's former subordinate, left his five-year career in the armed forces after his time in Syria because his own political views conflicted with what he experienced. ""Of course, you understand, who is right and who is wrong,"" Irisov said. ""I witnessed a lot of stuff, being inside the system."" Irisov then began what he hoped would be the start of a career as an international journalist, as a military reporter with Russian state news agency TASS. His wife worked there and he felt at the time it was ""the only main information agency"" that tried to ​cover news in an ""unbiased"" way, with ""some opportunity of freedom of speech,"" he said. ""Everything changed"" on February 24, 2022, when Putin's invasion of Ukraine began and TASS received orders from the FSB security service and defense ministry ""that everyone will be prosecuted if they don't execute the propaganda scheme,"" Irisov said. He had family in Kyiv, hiding in bomb shelters, and told CNN he knew ""nothing could justify this war."" He also knew from his military contacts that there were already many casualties in the first days of the war. ""For me it was obvious from the beginning,"" Irisov recalled. ""I tried to explain to people this war will lead to the collapse of Russia... it will be a great tragedy not only for Ukrainians but also for Russia."" Irisov fled Moscow with his pregnant wife and young child on March 8, 2022, after standing against the invasion. He had quit his job at TASS and signed petitions and an open letter against the war, he told CNN. After traveling to Armenia, Georgia, Turkey and finally Mexico, where they contacted the US embassy to ask for help, they are now working to start a new life in West Virginia. While serving at Latakia air base in Syria in 2019 and 2020, the 31-year-old says he worked on aviation safety and air traffic control, coordinating flights with Damascus' civilian airlines. He ​says he saw Surovikin several times during some missions and spoke to high-ranking officers under him. ""He made a lot of people very angry -- they hated him,"" Irisov said, describing how the ""direct"" and ""straight"" general was disliked at headquarters because of the way he tried to implement his infantry experience into the air force. Irisov says he understands Surovikin had strong connections with Kremlin-approved private military company the Wagner group​, which has operated in Syria. The Kremlin denies any connections to Wagner and insists that private military companies are illegal in Russia. Awarded 'hero' title Surovikin, whose military career began in 1983, has a checkered history, to say the least. In 2004, according to Russian media accounts and at least two think tanks, he berated a subordinate so severely that the subordinate took his own life. And a book by the think tank the Washington DC-based Jamestown Foundation says that during the unsuccessful coup attempt against former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991, soldiers under Surovikin's command killed three protesters, leading to Surovikin spending at least six months in prison. CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment on Surovikin's appointment and regarding allegations about his harsh leadership. In a 2020 report, Human Rights Watch named him as ""someone who may bear ​command responsibility"" for the dozens of air and ground attacks on civilian objects and infrastructure in violation of the laws of war​"" during the 2019-2020 Idlib offensive in Syria. ​The attacks killed at least 1,600 ​civilians and forced the displacement of an estimated 1.4 million people, according to HRW​​, which cites UN figures. During his time in Syria, the ​now-56-year-old was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation. In February this year, Surovikin was sanctioned by the European Union in his capacity as head of the Aerospace Forces ""for actively supporting and implementing actions and policies that undermine and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine as well as the stability or security in Ukraine."" Irisov believes there are three reasons why he has been put in charge in Ukraine now: his closeness to the government and Putin; his interbranch experience with both the infantry and air force; and his experience since the summer commanding Russian forces in the southern Ukrainian regions of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Crimea. These are areas that Putin is trying to control ""at any cost,"" said Irisov. Just two days after Surovikin's appointment on Saturday, Russia launched its heaviest bombardment of Ukraine since the early days of the war. Surovikin is ""more familiar with cruise missiles, maybe he used his connections and experience to organize this chain of devastating attacks,"" Irisov said​, referencing the reports that cruise missiles have been among the weapons deployed by Russia in this latest surge of attacks. But Clark, from the ISW, suggests the general's promotion is ""more of a framing thing to inject new blood into the Russian command system"" and ""put on this tough nationalist face."" His appointment ""got widespread praise from various Russian military bloggers as well as Yevgeny (Prigozhin), who's the financier of the Wagner Group,"" Clark said. He believes what's happening now is a reflection of what happened in April, when another commander, Alexander Dvornikov, was appointed overall commander of the operations in Ukraine. ""Similarly, he before then was a commander of one of the groupings of Russian forces and had sort of a master reputation in Syria much like Surovikin for brutality, earning this sort of name of the 'butcher of Aleppo,'"" Clark said. Dvornikov was also seen at the time as the commander ""that was going to turn things around in Ukraine and get the job done,"" he added. ""But an individual commander is not going to be able to change how tangled Russian command and control is at this point in the war, or the low morale of Russian forces."" Andrea Kendall-Taylor, director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, also told CNN this week that Surovikin's appointment ""reflects the ascendancy of a lot of hardline voices inside Russia... calling on Putin to make changes, and to bring in someone who would be willing to execute these ruthless attacks."" Clark reasons that ""from what we've seen, it's highly ​probable that Putin is involved in decision-making down to a very tactical level and in some cases bypassing the senior Russian military officers to interact directly on the battlefield."" Surovikin personally signed Irisov's resignation papers from the air force, he says. Now, Irisov sees him put in charge of operations in Putin's brutal war in Ukraine -- but what impact the general will or can have is not yet clear. According to Clark, ""there isn't a good Kremlin option if Surovikin doesn't perform or if Putin decides that he is also not up to the task. There aren't many other senior Russian officers and it's just going to lead to a further degradation of the Russian war effort.""",7,5.31176158829753,5.222898301989174,0.08886328630835649,28

2022-10-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/politics/treasury-department-sanctions-russia/index.html,"Western sanctions hurting Russia's ability to replenish military supplies, intelligence analysis shows","Western sanctions have sharply curtailed Russia's ability to replenish the munitions it is using in Ukraine, according to a new analysis from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, forcing Moscow to task its intelligence services with finding ways to evade restrictions and procure the critical technology and parts to sustain its war effort. Russia has lost more than 6,000 pieces of equipment since the war began nearly eight months ago, the analysis obtained by CNN shows, with the country's military struggling to acquire the microchips, engines and thermal imaging technology required to make new weapons. Sweeping Western restrictions on exports to Russia have forced the country's defense industrial facilities to periodically go idle. Two of the country's largest domestic microelectronics manufacturers were forced to temporarily halt production because they weren't able to secure necessary foreign components. And a shortage of bearings -- a low-tech component -- has undermined the production of tanks, aircraft, submarines and other military systems. Even as early as May, only a few months into the war, the Russian defense industry found itself short of supplies and components for marine diesel engines, helicopter and aircraft parts and fire control systems, according to the analysis. And Russia has turned to Soviet-era tanks, removing them from storage to use in Ukraine. The details were shared in a presentation with senior finance officials from nearly 30 nations Friday, who gathered at the Treasury Department for an update from Deputy US Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves and Deputy Director of National Intelligence Morgan Muir on the sanctions' effectiveness in choking off Russia's military industrial complex. ""They have to make critical choices about what they can do on the battlefield because they don't have the tanks they need, they don't have the equipment they need to make helicopters, they don't have the semiconductors they need to launch precision missiles into Ukraine,"" Adeyemo told CNN in an exclusive interview. The meeting comes as Russia renews bombardments of civilian infrastructure, including in the capital Kyiv, a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin's intent on terrorizing the Ukrainian population after months of embarrassing losses on the battlefield. US President Joe Biden, who said this week the attacks were ""beyond the pale,"" has warned that nuclear threats emanating from Russia could result in catastrophic mistakes and has wondered aloud at what Putin's ""off ramp"" in the war could be. The US and its allies are hurriedly working to send more air defense systems to Ukraine, the latest in tens of billions of dollars of military assistance that's flowed into the country over the past several months. The effort has turned Ukraine into a nation heavily armed with advanced weapons and the latest technology. On a parallel track, however, has been the effort to deprive Russia of its own ability to make new, advanced weapons, a process that officials acknowledged in the spring would take months to yield results as the country's military ran through its stocks. The effort has been coordinated between the Treasury Department, Pentagon and US intelligence agencies, who each bring experience in the makeup of Russia's critical supply chains. ""Russia is running out of troops, they're running out of ammunition. They're running out of tanks and other materials. And what we're trying to do using sanctions and export controls to make it harder for them to reinforce their troops and to get the things they need to fight the war in Ukraine,"" Adeyemo said. At the onset of the war, Russia suffered heavy losses and struggled with some of its advanced weapons. When they did use precision guided munitions, Russia suffered failure rates as high as 60%, US officials have previously said. Now, the US says Russia is ""expending munitions at an unsustainable rate"" and turning to Iran and North Korea for help, a sign of the shortfalls facing the country's own domestic defense industry after the US and other nations banned the export of key technologies needed for advanced weaponry at the start of the war. The presentation delivered Friday at the Treasury Department went further in spelling out how the export controls have been effective in limiting Russia's ability to either purchase or make new weapons -- and in providing allies with critical information to tighten their own sanctions efforts. A goal of the meeting was ""to provide information to them that many of them have never received before,"" a senior Treasury official said beforehand. The export restrictions have forced ""reliance on contraband chips, work-arounds, and lower-quality imports (for example from China) undermining weapons systems,"" the presentation reads, and have ""exposed vulnerability in 'chokepoint' technologies (small and innocuous parts such as bearings and fasteners)."" The extent to which Beijing is assisting Russia in its war effort has been the subject of intense scrutiny in Washington. Biden warned Chinese President Xi Jinping in a telephone call earlier this year against providing military assistance to Moscow. The US has gone after Chinese companies and research institutes for supporting Russia's military. Still, Adeyemo said Beijing so far hasn't been much help. ""China can't provide Russia with what China doesn't have,"" he said. ""And China doesn't produce the most advanced semiconductors. Those are produced by our allies and partners. So Russia is searching for these things. The reason they're using their intelligence services and front companies to try and get them is because the countries they would naturally turn to don't have them."" Russia has sought to skirt the Western restrictions on critical technology through vast networks of wealthy oligarchs and front companies, the new analysis says, targeting Europe and North America in particular in an effort to procure the required components. The effort to prevent the sanctions evasion has led to a ""continuing cat-and-mouse game to detect and take action against these channels.""",49,5.65239101132439,4.205058000828668,1.447333010495722,23

According to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran. Ukraine claimed its forces had shot down one of these drones for the first time last month near the city of Kupyansk in Kharkiv. There have been more reported attacks since then. Kyiv's military said Wednesday it had downed 17 Shahed-136 drones that day alone. According to photos released by Ukrainian authorities, Russia has rebranded the Shaheds and is using them under the name of ""Geran."" US officials say there has been ""some evidence already"" that the Iranian drones ""have already experienced numerous failures"" on the battlefield. US Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Sasha Baker told reporters late last month that ""the idea that they represent some technological leap ahead, frankly we're just not seeing borne out in the data."" Moscow also has its own kamikaze drones, made by the Russian weapons manufacturer Kalashnikov Concern. Ukraine claimed on Wednesday it had shot down two of these ZALA Lancet drones that day. How can Ukraine defend itself against these drones? Ukraine has been asking its allies for air defense systems since the beginning of the war in February, but the need has become more urgent since Russia started using the Iranian-made drones. Air defense systems were one of the top three priorities on a Ukrainian weapons wish list presented during a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, according to a handout provided to defense ministers participating in the gathering. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters after the meeting on Wednesday that the US and its allies needed to provide Ukraine with air defense systems in order for Ukraine to help defend its airspace against incoming attacks from Russian forces. ""Many countries have Patriot, many countries have other systems, there's a whole series of Israeli systems that are quite capable, the Germans have systems as we mentioned, so a lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems,"" Milley said. ""The task will be to bring those together, get them deployed, get them trained, because each of these systems is different, make sure they can link together with a command and control and communication systems and make sure they have radars that can talk to each other so they can acquire targets on the inbound flights."" The air defenses Ukraine needs to combat kamikaze drones are different from the systems that are used against cruise missiles and similar weapons. The Patriot air defense missile system -- which stands for ""Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target"" -- is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, as well as advanced aircraft and cruise missiles, and could be used against drones. Ukrainian officials said that Ukrainian air defense forces were already taking down the ""bulk"" of the Shahed drones. Ukraine's senior military commander, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, tweeted Tuesday his thanks to Poland as ""brothers in arms"" for training an air defense battalion that he said had destroyed nine of 11 Shaheds. He said Poland had given Ukraine ""systems"" to help destroy the drones. Last month there were reports that the Polish government had bought advanced Israeli equipment (Israel has a policy of not selling ""advanced defensive technology"" to Kyiv) and was then transferring it to Ukraine. Zelensky made another plea for more air defense capacities on Thursday, saying Kyiv has only about 10% of what it needs to combat Moscow's attacks. Does Ukraine have kamikaze drones too? The Ukrainian military has been using RAM II kamikaze drones, which were developed by a consortium of Ukrainian companies and bought with money crowdfunded by ordinary Ukrainians. These precision-guided loitering munitions can carry 3 kilogram (6.6 pound) warheads and have a flight range of up to 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), according to the manufacturers. But Kyiv has also been relying on its allies for drone supplies. The US has sent several types of aerial weapon systems to Ukraine. These include Switchblade drones -- small, portable kamikaze drones that can carry a warhead and detonate on impact. The Switchblade 300 and the larger Switchblade 600 are produced by American defense company AeroVironment. The smaller Switchblade 300 can hit a target up to 6 miles away (9.6 kilometers), according to specifications provided by the company, while the larger Switchblade 600 can strike more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Both systems can be set up and launched within minutes. In May, the US sent the Ukrainian military ""phoenix ghost"" drones, which are believed to be similar to Switchblade, although little is known about their capabilities. The UK has also provided Ukraine with loitering munitions, including 850 hand-launched Black Hornet micro-drones. Ukraine has also been using Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones. These have become something of a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance. However, these are larger and designed to return home after dropping laser-guided bombs or missiles.",49,5.654471180613418,2.1336255736158583,3.5208456069975593,11
2022-10-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/europe/ukraine-russia-war-next-stages-intl/index.html,Russia is bruised as winter approaches. Can Ukraine land another blow?,"The relative calm in Ukrainian cities far from the country's battlefields was shattered by two painfully familiar sounds this week: the ominous ring of the air raid sirens, and the eruptions of Russian attacks. A wave of missiles, rockets and drones has struck dozens of locations across Ukraine since Monday, according to officials, targeting civilian infrastructure in several major cities, including Kyiv, located hundreds of miles from the front lines in the east and south. The wide bombardment echoed the early days of Russia's scattershot initial invasion in February, but also underlined that the conflict in Ukraine, which for months appeared to be descending into a slow and painful grind in the Donbas, has erupted once again as winter nears. Not for the first time, the war is teetering towards an unpredictable new phase. ""This is now the third, fourth, possibly fifth different war that we've been observing,"" said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia Programme. The strikes followed weeks of Ukrainian ground gains and began two days after a huge explosion damaged the Kerch bridge, the only crossing between the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russia. That blast, which was used by the Kremlin as a justification for Monday's onslaught, bruised the Russian psyche and handed Ukraine a significant strategic boost. With the cold months nearing and likely bringing a slowdown in ground combat, experts say the next weeks of the war are now expected to be vital, and another potential spike in intensity looms over Ukraine as each side seeks to strike another blow. ""What seemed a distant prospect for anything that could be convincingly described as a Ukraine victory is now very much more plausible,"" Giles said. ""The response from Russia is likely to escalate further."" 'Playing for the whistle' Monday's attacks, and further strikes throughout the week, were evidence of Russian President Vladimir Putin lashing out after a series of setbacks in the war that have put him under pressure domestically. And the airborne strikes distract from what has been a dismal stretch for Russia in the ground war. Oleksii Hromov, a senior Ukrainian military official, said last week that Kyiv's forces have recaptured some 120 settlements since late September as they advance in the Kharkiv, Donetsk and Kherson regions. On Wednesday, Ukraine said it had liberated more five settlements in its slow but steady push in Kherson. Russia said Thursday its forces would help evacuate residents of occupied Kherson to other areas, as Ukraine's offensive continued to make gains in the region. The announcement came shortly after the head of the Moscow-backed administration in Kherson appealed to the Kremlin for help moving residents out of harm's way, in the latest indication that Russian forces were struggling in the face of Ukrainian advances. These counter-offensives have shifted the momentum of the war and disproved a suggestion, built up in the West and in Russia during the summer, that while Ukraine could stoutly defend territory, it lacked the ability to seize ground. ""The Russians are playing for the whistle -- (hoping to) avoid a collapse in their frontline before the winter sets in,"" Samir Puri, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the author of ""Russia's Road to War with Ukraine,"" told CNN. ""If they can get to Christmas with the frontline looking roughly as it is, that's a huge success for the Russians given how botched this has been since February."" Faced with growing setbacks, the Kremlin appointed a new overall commander of Russia's invasion. But there is little sign that Gen. Sergey Surovikin can lead his forces back onto the front foot before the end of the year, given the pace and cost of the Ukrainian counter-offensives. Ukrainian troops are focused primarily on pushing Russian forces eastwards, having crossed the Oskil River in late September, with Moscow likely preparing to defend the cities of Starobilsk and Svatove in the Luhansk region, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Landing a major blow in Donbas would send another powerful signal, and Ukraine will be eager to improve on its gains before temperatures plummet on the battlefield, and the full impact of rising energy prices is felt around Europe. ""There are so many reasons why there is an incentive for Ukraine to get things done quickly,"" Giles said. ""The winter energy crisis in Europe, and energy infrastructure and power being destroyed in Ukraine itself, is always going to be a test of resilience for Ukraine and its Western backers."" NATO leaders have vowed to stand behind Ukraine regardless of how long the war takes, but several European countries -- particularly those that relied heavily on Russian energy -- are staring down a crippling cost-of-living crisis which, without signs of Ukrainian progress on the battlefield, could endanger public support. Recent days have meanwhile shown that sites beyond the current theater of ground fighting are far from immune to attacks. It remains unclear exactly how the Kerch bridge bombing was carried out -- and Kyiv has not claimed responsibility -- but the fact that a target so deep in Russian-held territory could be successfully hit hinted at a serious Ukrainian threat towards key Russian assets. Russia scrambles for manpower Russia is struggling on the ground and has failed to achieve supremacy in the air, but Monday's attacks may have achieved one goal -- sending a signal of strength towards the growing list of Putin's internal critics. The assault damaged civilian infrastructure in cities all across Ukraine, killing multiple people and knocking out power in pockets of the country. They were ""an indication of the nature of the threat from Russia,"" Giles said. ""For many months now, the Russian objective has been to destroy Ukraine rather than possess it."" Ukraine's national electricity company, Ukrenergo, says it has stabilized the power supply to Kyiv and central regions of Ukraine after much of the country's electricity supply was disrupted by Russian missile attacks on Monday and Tuesday. But Ukrainian Prime Minister has warned that ""there is a lot of work to do"" to fix damaged equipment, and asked Ukrainians to reduce their energy usage during peak hours. Experts believe it remains unlikely that Russia's aerial bombardment will form a recurrent pattern; while estimating the military reserves of either army is a murky endeavor, Western assessments suggest Moscow may not have the capacity to keep it up. ""We know -- and Russian commanders on the ground know -- that their supplies and munitions are running out,"" Jeremy Fleming, a UK's spy chief, said in a rare speech on Tuesday. That conclusion was also reached by the ISW, which said in its daily update on the conflict Monday that the strikes ""wasted some of Russia's dwindling precision weapons against civilian targets, as opposed to militarily significant targets."" ""Russia's use of its limited supply of precision weapons in this role may deprive Putin of options to disrupt ongoing Ukrainian counter-offensives,"" the ISW assessed. Exactly how much weaponry and manpower each side has left in reserve will be crucial to determining how the momentum will shift in the coming weeks. Ukraine said it intercepted 18 cruise missiles on Tuesday and dozens more on Monday, but it is urging its Western allies for more equipment to repel any future attacks. ""The barrage of missile strikes is going to be an occasional feature reserved for shows of extreme outrage, because the Russians don't have the stocks of precision munitions to maintain that kind of high-tempo missile assault into the future,"" Puri said. Some help for Putin may be on the way, however. An announcement by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that Belarus and Russia will ""deploy a joint regional group of troops"" raised fears of deepened military cooperation between the close allies and that Belarusian troops could formally join Russia in its invasion. Belarus has been complaining of alleged Ukrainian threats to its security in recent days, which observers say could be a prelude to some level of involvement. The impact of such an intervention in terms of pure manpower would be limited; Belarus has around 45,000 active duty troops, which would not significantly bolster Russia's reserves. But it would threaten another assault on Ukraine's northern flank below the Belarusian border. ""The reopening of a northern front would be another new challenge for Ukraine,"" Giles said. It would provide Russia a new route into the Kharkiv oblast (region), which has been recaptured by Ukraine, should Putin prioritize an effort to reclaim that territory, he said. Any further Belarusian involvement in the war could also have a psychological impact, Puri suggested. ""Everyone's mind in Ukraine and in the West has been oriented towards fighting one army,"" he said. Inside Russia, Belarus joining the invasion ""would play into Putin's narrative that this war is about reuniting the lands of ancient Rus states."" A plea to the West By flipping the narrative of the conflict over the past two months, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has achieved one of his own key objectives: showing Ukraine's Western allies that their military aid can help Kyiv win the war. Now Zelensky will hope for more supplies in the short-term as he seeks to drive home those gains. The leader has sought to highlight Ukraine's success in intercepting Russian missiles, saying more than half of the missiles and drones launched at Ukraine in a second wave of strikes on Tuesday were brought down. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that Ukraine needed ""more"" systems to better halt missile attacks, ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. ""These air defense systems are making a difference because many of the incoming missiles [this week] were actually shot down by the Ukrainian air defense systems provided by NATO Allies,"" he said. ""But of course, as long as not all of them are shot down, of course there is a need for more,"" Stoltenberg added. Justin Bronk, a military expert with the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), agreed with that assessment, telling CNN that, ""Ukrainian interception success rates against Russian cruise missiles have risen significantly since the start of the invasion in February."" Ukraine ""badly needed"" modern systems such as the IRIS-T that arrived this week from Germany and the NASAMS expected from the United States, Bronk said. Beyond weapons supplies, Ukraine will be watching to ensure that Western resolve stays firm if Russia tightens energy supplies even further. ""There are many things Russia can do to make the war personal, not just for people of Ukraine but around Europe, to try to force pressure on governments",7,4.897430513776793,3.0302775904520383,1.8671529233247544,13
2022-10-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/europe/ukraine-missile-defense-race-intl/index.html,Russia's hit-and-miss missile blitz forces a frantic race to shore up Ukrainian defenses,"The Russian military appears to have embarked on a new tactic in its efforts to turn the tide of its faltering war: trying to overwhelm Ukraine's largely Soviet-era air defenses with dozens of missiles and drones from multiple directions. As Ukraine races to shore up its missile defenses in the wake of the assault, the math for Moscow is simple: A percentage of projectiles are bound to get through. Russia's aerial onslaught of the last few days has been largely directed at Ukraine's energy infrastructure, using a variety of missiles and newly acquired Iranian drones. But while the damage has been substantial, Ukraine claims that it has taken out around half of the missiles fired -- and it expects that success rate to improve as new air defenses arrive from Germany, the US and elsewhere. Over the last three days, the Russians have been using a mix of their missile stocks. The majority were air-launched cruise missiles, some delivered by bombers based near the Caspian Sea. But they also deployed ship-launched Kalibrs from the Black Sea, ground-launched Iskander cruise missiles and dozens of attack drones. The great unknown is just how far such a blitz is depleting Russian inventories -- and whether increasingly they will resort to stocks of older, less accurate but equally powerful missiles. Estimating Russian missile inventories is guesswork. In May, President Volodymr Zelensky said Russia had launched 2,154 missiles and had probably used up 60% of its precision-missile arsenal. That now looks like wishful thinking. The Pentagon's view at the time was that of its weapons stocks, Russia was ""running the lowest on cruise missiles, particularly air-launched cruise missiles,"" but that Moscow still had more than 50% of its pre-war inventory. Some of that inventory was dispatched this week. But Russia has recently resorted to using much older and less precise KH-22 missiles (originally made as an anti-ship weapon), of which it still has large inventories, according to Western officials. Weighing 5.5 tons, they are designed to take out aircraft carriers. A KH-22 was responsible for the dozens of casualties at a shopping mall in Kremenchuk in June. Even the more modern KH-101 missile has an accuracy of up to 50 meters, which hardly qualifies as a ""precision weapon."" The Russians have also been adapting the S-300 -- normally an air defense missile -- as an offensive weapon, with some effect. These have wrought devastation in Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv, among other places, and their speed makes them difficult to intercept. But they are hardly accurate. There's no doubt this week's missile attacks, beyond causing dozens of casualties, have inflicted significant damage. Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko told CNN on Tuesday that around 30% of the country's energy infrastructure had been hit by Russian missiles since Monday. He told CNN's Richard Quest that this was the ""first time from the beginning of the war"" that Russia has ""dramatically targeted"" energy infrastructure. But Ukraine's energy operators are getting used to repairing electricity substations, pylons and thermal power plants. Zelensky said Tuesday: ""Most of the towns and villages, which terrorists wanted to leave without electricity and communication, already have electricity and communication back."" Over the past nine months, the Ukrainians have also had plenty of practice in using their limited air defenses, mainly BUK and S-300 systems. But Yurii Ihnat, spokesman for the Air Force Command, said Tuesday said of these systems: ""This equipment does not last forever, there may be losses in combat operations."" And he noted that ""the manufacturer of this [equipment] is Russia, so we will have to say goodbye to them sooner or later."" Ukrainian air defense battalions have become innovative: One video from Monday, referenced by Zelensky, showed a soldier using a shoulder-held missile to bring down a Russian projectile, purportedly a cruise missile. Zelensky said in a video message Tuesday that 20 of 28 missiles fired at Ukraine that morning had been shot down. Ukrainian officials have told CNN that more than half the Russian cruise missiles fired on Monday and Tuesday were brought down: 65 out of 112. But that still means about 50 hit their targets, enough to cause massive damage. Estimating the proportion of Iranian-made Shahed drones being eliminated is more difficult, because so many are being used. Zelensky said that ""every 10 minutes I receive a message about the enemy's use of Iranian Shaheds."" But he also said the bulk of them were being shot down. Last month, the US deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, Sasha Baker, said the US had seen ""some evidence already"" that the Iranian drones ""have already experienced numerous failures."" An 'air shield' Speaking to the G7 meeting on Tuesday, Zelensky appealed for an air shield for Ukraine. ""When Ukraine receives a sufficient number of modern and effective air defense systems, the key element of Russian terror -- missile strikes -- will cease to work."" Ukraine's allies understand this need. Ahead of a meeting in Brussels Wednesday of Ukraine's supporters, General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that ""after Russia attacked the Ukrainian civilian population, we will be looking for air defense options that will help the Ukrainians."" A senior Defense Department official added that work was continuing on improving Ukrainian air defenses, including ""finding Soviet-era capabilities to make sure that countries were ready (and) could donate them and help move those capabilities."" Ukraine's wish-list -- circulated at Wednesday's meeting -- included missiles for their existing systems and a ""transition to Western-origin layered air defense system"" as well as ""early warning capabilities."" Milley said that ""what we think can be provided is an integrated air missile defense system."" Speaking after the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, he said such a system would not ""control all the airspace over Ukraine, but they are designed to control priority targets that Ukraine needs to protect. What you're looking at really is short-range low-altitude systems and then medium-range medium altitude and then long-range and high altitude systems, and it's a mix of all of these."" Western systems are beginning to trickle in. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Tuesday that a ""new era of air defense has begun"" with the arrival of the first IRIS-T from Germany, and two units of the US National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAM) expected soon. ""This is only the beginning. And we need more,"" Reznikov said Wednesday before tweeting as he met with Ukraine's donors at the Brussels meeting:"" Item #1 on today's agenda is strengthening (Ukraine's) air defense. Feeling optimistic."" But these are hardly off-the-shelf-items. The IRIS-T had to be manufactured for Ukraine. Western governments have limited inventories of such systems. And Ukraine is a very large country under missile attack from three directions. It's also uneconomical to waste advanced systems on taking out cheap drones. But there may be other answers for the hundreds of attack drones Russia is now deploying. According to Zelensky, Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran. However, Ukrainian officials say that air defense forces are already taking down the ""bulk"" of the Shahed drones. Ukraine's senior military commander, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, tweeted Tuesday his thanks to Poland as ""brothers in arms"" for training an air defense battalion that had destroyed nine of 11 Shaheeds. He said Poland had given Ukraine ""systems"" to help destroy the drones. Last month there were reports that the Polish government had bought advanced Israeli equipment (Israel has a policy of not selling ""advanced defensive technology"" to Kyiv) and was then transferring it to Ukraine. There's now a race between the Ukrainians' ability to acquire new air defense hardware, train on it and deploy it -- and the Russians' ability to inflict massive damage on Ukrainian infrastructure (civilian and military) with their deep stocks of missiles, not all of which are precision weapons. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that Ukraine needed ""more"" systems to better halt missile attacks. ""These air defense systems are making a difference because many of the incoming missiles (this week) were actually shot down by the Ukrainian air defense systems provided by NATO Allies,"" he said. ""But of course, as long as not all of them are shot down, of course there is a need for more."" Until more arrive, there is the risk -- all too familiar to the government and people of Ukraine -- that the Russian mix of missiles will wreak much greater havoc among the civilian population, especially if the Russians persist with the tactic of using swarms of missiles, inundating air defenses.",49,1.6578490580425145,2.5623978892178223,-0.9045488311753078,21
2022-10-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/politics/milley-ukraine-air-defense/index.html,Top American general says US and allies need to help Ukraine build a comprehensive missile defense system,"The US and its allies need to help Ukraine build a comprehensive air and missile defense system by combining the different systems the allies operate to help Kyiv defend its airspace against Russian attacks, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said Wednesday after a gathering of military leaders and defense ministers in Brussels. ""What needs to be done here by all the various countries that were at the conference today is chip in and help them rebuild and sustain an integrated air and missile defense system,"" Milley said at a press conference after the meeting. Ukrainian leaders have re-emphasized their urgent need for air defense systems from Western nations after a series of Russian missile attacks targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure across the country over the weekend. Ministers and Chiefs of Defense from 50 countries participated in the sixth meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group hosted by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, the sixth meeting of the group since April. Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov and Major General Eduard Moskaliov, Ukraine's joint forces commander, attended the meeting and briefed the ministers on the ""latest battlefield dynamics"" in Ukraine, Austin said in the press conference. Milley emphasized the US cannot protect Ukraine's skies from incoming missile and air attacks on its own. In order to protect the skies above the country, the US and its allies should contribute air defense systems they have and then help Ukraine use the systems together to create a defense, Milley said. ""Many countries have other systems, there's a whole series of Israeli systems that are quite capable. The Germans have systems as we mentioned, so a lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems,"" Milley said. Milley suggested if multiple countries send the air defense systems they have, Ukrainians can ""link"" them together ""with a command and control and communication systems."" The top US general's remarks represent a possible change in approach from Ukraine's allies to help them counter the recent incoming attacks from Russian forces. While the US has provided billions of dollars worth of military assistance since Russia invaded in February, Putin's recent aerial attacks on civilian infrastructure highlight how vulnerable Ukraine still remains to missile attacks from the air. Pooling together different systems would potentially provide Ukraine the help it needs more quickly, but would likely present a logistical challenge in getting Ukrainians trained on the systems and able to operate them together. The US has already committed eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems to Ukraine, with the first two of the systems arriving by the end of November or early December, according to Pentagon officials. The US first announced it would send two NASAMs to Ukraine on July 1 in a Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package of military assistance and announced it would send six more on Aug. 24. Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative packages give the Pentagon the ability to source weapons from industry rather than supplying them directly from US stockpiles. In a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Monday, President Joe Biden ""pledged to continue providing Ukraine with the support needed to defend itself, including advanced air defense systems,"" a readout of the call from the White House said. Germany delivered its first of four IRIS-T SLM air-to-air missile systems to Ukraine Monday, German defense minister Christine Lambrecht said in a tweet. 'Complicated' but 'achievable' ""The task will be to bring those together, get them deployed, get them trained, cause each of these systems is different, make sure they can link together with a command and control and communication systems and make sure they have radars that can talk to each other so they can acquire targets on the inbound flights,"" Milley said. The execution of this strategy will be ""quite complicated from a technical standpoint,"" but Milley said it ""is achievable."" Austin said the US would get systems to Ukraine ""as fast as we can physically get them there,"" after the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting. ""This is something, as I said at the top, that we remain focused on,"" Austin said. ""We're going to provide systems that we have available, that countries like Germany have available. We're also going to try to provide additional munitions to the existing systems that Ukrainians are using."" US officials say it is difficult to know how many missiles and drones Russia has left at its disposal. In addition to launching cruise missiles and Iranian kamikaze drones, Russia also used surface-to-air missiles repurposed as ground attack weapons during the recent assault. ""The reliance on systems that were not intended for their current use is indicative of a depletion of [Russian] precision guided munitions,"" one US official told CNN. But without knowing how many Russia had before the war, it remains incredibly difficult to estimate how many they have left seven months later. Ukraine is also having to contend with Russia's use of Iranian drones. The US does not know how many Moscow has in its possession, but one senior US military official estimated Russia has purchased ""hundreds"" of them as of October 4.",49,1.9602333046316662,3.344303347466669,-1.3840700428350026,21

2022-10-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/politics/putin-rage-against-civilians-analysis/index.html,Putin's rage against civilians may herald a brutal new phase in the war,"Vladimir Putin's latest display of brutality and vengeance might be a fit of fury over his signature Crimean bridge being blown up. But his indiscriminate targeting of Ukrainian civilians also raises the prospect of a horrific new turn in a vicious war. Russian missiles damaged a glass-bottomed footbridge in Kyiv that is a popular tourist site, tore into intersections at rush hour and crashed down near a children's playground on Monday. Power outages rolled across the country, in places cutting off water supplies and transport, in strikes that recalled the terror inflicted on civilians in the invasion's early days but that had largely ebbed in recent months. Russian forces launched new attacks Tuesday, with rockets hitting two energy facilities in western Ukraine, ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's appearance at an emergency virtual meeting of G7 leaders. The assaults snatched away the semblance of normality that city dwellers, who spent months earlier in the war in subways turned into air raid shelters, have managed to restore to their lives and raised fears of new strikes. The message was obvious for the world to see. Putin does not intend to be humiliated. He will not admit defeat. And he is quite prepared to inflict civilian carnage and indiscriminate terror in response to his string of battlefield reversals. But the targets on Monday also had little military value and, if anything, served to reflect Putin's need to find new targets because of his inability to inflict defeats on Ukraine on the battlefield. The bombing of power installations, in particular, Monday appeared to be an unsubtle hint of the misery the Russian President could inflict as winter sets in, even as his forces retreat in the face of Ukrainian troops using western arms. This possibility that Putin could be heralding a bloody new twist in a war that has gone through multiple strategic phases since the invasion in February was weighing heavy on the minds of political and military leaders in Washington Monday. Their reaction was laced with revulsion that Putin was again unleashing callous warfare against civilians that recalled Europe's 20th century horrors. How should the US respond The attacks on civilians, which killed at least 19 people and injured more than 100 others, also drove new attention to what next steps the US and its allies must take to respond, after already sending billions of dollars of arms and kits to Ukraine in an effective proxy war with Moscow. President Joe Biden Monday spoke to Zelensky and offered advanced air systems that would help defend against Russian air attacks, but the White House did not specify exactly what might be sent. John Kirby, the coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council, suggested Washington was looking favorably on Ukraine's requests and was in touch with the government in Kyiv almost every day. ""We do the best we can in subsequent packages to meet those needs,"" he told CNN's Kate Bolduan. Kirby was also unable to say whether Putin was definitively shifting his strategy from a losing battlefield war to a campaign to pummel civilian morale and inflict devastating damage on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, though he suggested it was a trend developing in recent days and had already been in the works. ""It likely was something that they had been planning for quite some time. Now that's not to say that the explosion on the Crimea bridge might have accelerated some of their planning,"" Kirby said. An onslaught on civilians would be consistent with the resume of the new Russian general in charge of the war, Sergey Surovikin, who served in Syria and Chechnya. In both places, Russia indiscriminately bombarded civilian areas and razed built-up districts and infrastructure and is accused of committing serious human rights violations. The rain of fire against Ukrainian civilians on Monday was also chilling, given that it occurred following Putin's latest nuclear threats and days of debate over whether he might use a tactical nuclear weapon. If he does not, it seems unlikely -- given his obliviousness to civilian pain -- that any such decision would be motivated by a desire to spare innocents from such a horrific weapon. Still, Kirby said that there was no indication that Russia was activating nuclear arms or that the US needed to change its own nuclear posture. But French President Emmanuel Macron underscored western concerns that Monday's rush-hour attacks in Ukraine could be the prelude to another pivot in the conflict. ""It is a profound change of the nature of this war,"" he told reporters. Ex-US official: Putin is telegraphing a grim winter Retired Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, former director for European Affairs on the National Security Council, said that by attacking targets designed to hurt Ukrainian morale and energy infrastructure, Putin was sending a message about how he will prosecute the war in the coming months. ""He was telegraphing about where he is going to go as we get into the winter. He is going to try to force the Ukrainian population to compromise, to give up territory, by going after this infrastructure,"" Vindman said on CNN's ""New Day."" Bolstering the impression that Ukraine's power grid was now in the firing line, the Ministry of Defense in Moscow on Tuesday said it launched what it described as a ""massive attack"" on Ukraine's ""military control and energy system."" Authorities in the western Lviv region reported three explosions at two energy facilities. Vindman called on the US to provide air defense equipment and weapons that could go after Iranian-made drones used in Monday's attacks to help protect civilians and power plants. Igor Zhovkva, Zelensky's chief diplomatic adviser, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" that Ukraine had shot down 56 of the 84 missiles and drones that were fired by Russia, in apparent revenge for an explosion on a strategic bridge leading to annexed Crimea that is critical for Moscow's war effort and is a symbol of Putin's rule. ""So imagine if we had modern equipment, we probably could raise the number of those drones and missiles downed and not kill innocent civilians or wound and injure Ukrainians,"" Zhovkva said. Any prolonged campaign by Putin against civilians would be aimed at breaking Ukrainian morale and possibly unleashing a new flood of refugees into Western Europe that might open divisions among NATO allies that are supporting Ukraine. The early signs, however, suggest that Putin has once again misread how the world would respond to his brutality. Macron, for instance, said the attacks would prompt France to increase military assistance to Kyiv. Traumatic footage of Ukrainian civilians live streaming Russian missiles roaring over their heads and explosions may serve to harden the opinion of Western publics facing their own pressure this winter because of Putin's energy war. And if anything, the turning of fire on civilians hints at Russian -- rather than Ukrainian -- weakness, since it suggests Putin is unable to respond in the field to humiliating defeats for his forces. The lesson of this horrible war is that everything Putin has done to fracture a nation he doesn't believe has the right to exist has only strengthened and unified it. Olena Gnes, a mother of three who is documenting the war on YouTube, told CNN's Anderson Cooper live from her basement in Ukraine on Monday that she was angry at the return of fear and violence to the lives of Ukrainians from a new round of Russian ""terror."" But she vowed while cradling her infant that Putin's tactics wouldn't work. ""This is just another terror to provoke maybe panic, to scare you guys in other countries or to show to his own people that he is still a bloody tyrant, he is still powerful and look what fireworks we can arrange,"" she said. ""We do not feel desperate ... we are more sure even than before that Ukraine will win and we need it as fast as possible because ... only after we win in this war and only after Russia is defeated, we will have our peace back here.""

2022-10-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/europe/ukraine-russia-attacks-intl/index.html,Zelensky asks G7 for 'air shield' as rockets rain down on Ukraine,"As deadly Russian airstrikes continued into a second day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday asked the Group of 7 nations to help his country establish an ""air shield"" against aerial attacks. Zelensky's plea comes amid one of the fiercest bombing campaigns that Russia has waged against Ukraine since invading in late February. At least 19 people have been killed and more than 100 wounded across the country, as far away as the western city of Lviv, hundreds of miles from the war's main theaters in eastern and southern Ukraine. Russia has carried out over 30 missile strikes so far on Tuesday, compared to 84 on Monday. Roughly half of those on Tuesday were neutralized by air defenses, according to Ukraine's military. It is unclear how much longer the Russian military may be able to sustain such attacks. But Zelensky said his country needs more help with missile defense systems to combat Moscow's blitz. ""When Ukraine receives a sufficient number of modern and effective air defense systems, the key element of Russian terror -- missile strikes -- will cease to work,"" the Ukrainian President told leaders of the G7 nations Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Zelensky also reiterated his demand for Russia to be declared a terrorist state and further sanctions. ""We must block its energy sector with sanctions, break the stability of Russian revenues from oil and gas trade. A tough price cap is needed for the exports of oil and gas from Russia -- zero profit for the terrorist state,"" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday the intensified barrage of cruise missile and drone strikes are a response to what the Kremlin has called a terrorist attack on the Kerch Bridge, which connects the Russian mainland to the annexed Crimean Peninsula. The bridge, an important artery for both civilian and military traffic, was damaged in a huge explosion early Saturday. What exactly caused the blast remains unclear; Ukraine has not acknowledged responsibility for the incident, and some officials in Kyiv, including Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, allege that the Russian campaign this week was planned before the bridge blast. According to Russia, Tuesday's strikes targeted Ukrainian military sites and power stations -- the latter of which Kuleba described as a war crime ""aimed at creating unbearable conditions for civilians."" Two ""energy facilities"" in Lviv were among those struck. Russia's military escalation this week has been met with widespread outrage, especially among Western democracies. Following its virtual meeting Tuesday, the leaders of the G7 condemned Russia's recent moves to annex Ukrainian territory and its recent ""escalatory steps."" Experts have cautioned that Putin's recent maneuvers -- including annexations of occupied territory, this week's bombing campaign and allusions to nuclear weapons -- are signs of weakness from the Kremlin. The head of the UK's largest spy agency, Jeremy Fleming, said there is ""desperation at many levels inside Russian society and inside the Russian military machine,"" while NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said ""Ukraine has the momentum"" in the conflict. ""Russia is increasingly resorting to horrific and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and critical infrastructure. President Putin is failing in Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said at a news conference Tuesday.",49,2.349471871357447,1.660480932932391,0.6889909384250559,25

During the call, a White House statement said, Biden ""expressed his condemnation of Russia's missile strikes across Ukraine, including in Kyiv, and conveyed his condolences to the loved ones of those killed and injured in these senseless attacks. President Biden pledged to continue providing Ukraine with the support needed to defend itself, including advanced air defense systems."" The White House did not specify which air defense systems Biden discussed with Zelensky, but the United States previously committed to providing Ukraine with National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems. NASAMS would be capable of engaging Russian cruise missiles. Biden, the statement said, ""also underscored his ongoing engagement with allies and partners to continue imposing costs on Russia, holding Russia accountable for its war crimes and atrocities, and providing Ukraine with security, economic, and humanitarian assistance."" Asked whether the attacks of the past 24 hours would change the calculus on what the US would consider offering Ukraine, a senior administration official said they had no announcements to make on that front, but that the US will continue to help provide Ukraine with short- and long-range air defense systems, as it has in the past. And a second senior administration official provided the following summary of air defense aid provided to Ukraine from the US: ""We have transferred more than 1,400 Stinger anti-air systems to Ukraine, as well as air surveillance and multi-mission radars. We enabled our Allies to transfer air defense systems of their own to Ukraine -- including Slovakia's transfer of a critical S-300 system in April. And in August, President Biden announced a new assistance package for Ukraine that included orders for 8 new NASAMS—National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems. We will continue to provide Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself."" As of a Department of Defense briefing in late September, the US had yet to deliver NASAMS to Ukraine. At the time, Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said two systems were expected to be delivered in the next two months, with the remaining six to arrive at an undetermined date. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also spoke with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Monday to reiterate US support following the deadly strikes. Biden is expected on Tuesday to join an emergency video conference with G7 leaders during which Zelensky is expected to address the group. Russia launched a total of 84 cruise missiles against targets across Ukraine on Monday, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a Facebook post. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the strikes were a response to what he described as acts of ""terrorism"" by Kyiv. Specifically, he referred to Saturday's explosion on the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and Crimea -- which he blamed on Ukraine's ""special services"" -- and a list of other alleged ""crimes."" Kuleba said that such claims were ""nonsense,"" writing in a tweet, ""Putin is desperate because of battlefield defeats and uses missile terror to try to change the pace of war in his favor."" And Ukraine's defense intelligence agency claimed in a statement on Monday that Moscow had been planning a ""massive"" missile attack on Ukraine since early last week. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, also recently said he thinks Moscow should aim for the ""complete dismantling"" of Zelensky's ""regime."" In a post on Telegram, Medvedev -- who served as President of Russia between 2008 and 2012 -- said: ""The Ukrainian state in its current configuration ... will pose a constant, direct and clear threat to Russia. Therefore, in addition to protecting our people and protecting the borders of the country, the goal of our future actions, in my opinion, should be the complete dismantling of the political regime of Ukraine."" John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Monday that there will likely be additional support packages for Ukraine announced ""in the very near future."" ""It's clear that he's feeling the pressure both at home and overseas, and how he reacts to that only he can say,"" Kirby told CNN's Kate Bolduan on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Kirby added: ""He understands well that he's not doing well on the battlefield."" Asked if he thinks such strikes make it more likely Putin would resort to nuclear weapons, Kirby said that the US has seen nothing new. ""We continue to monitor his nuclear capabilities, Kate, best we can. And what I can tell you today is that we just don't see any indications that Mr. Putin has made a decision to use weapons of mass destruction or even nuclear weapons. And we've seen nothing, Kate, that would give us cause to change our own deterrent posture,"" Kirby said. The mention of air defense system comes amid a series of escalations in the war. Putin last month delivered a speech announcing the partial mobilization of some 300,000 reservists following successful Ukrainian counterattacks, raising the specter of nuclear weapons if he deemed the ""territorial integrity"" of Russia to be jeopardized. And the Russian president recently announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions in defiance of international law. Last week, Biden delivered a stark warning about the dangers of Putin's nuclear threats, invoking the prospect of ""Armageddon."" But multiple US officials have said the comment was not based on any new intelligence about Putin's intentions or changes in Russia's nuclear posture.

2022-10-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/europe/ukraine-kyiv-missile-strikes-russia-intl/index.html,"Putin warns of more attacks after deadly Russian strikes rock Kyiv, Lviv and other Ukrainian cities","Multiple explosions rocked Kyiv and several other Ukrainian cities reported blasts and power outages on Monday morning, as Russia lashed out with a massive wave of violent airstrikes that carried echoes of the initial days of its invasion. At least 11 people were killed in the strikes, while 64 were wounded, the Ukrainian emergency services said. Moscow fired at least 84 cruise missiles toward Ukraine on Monday, the Ukrainian military said, 43 of which were neutralized by missile defense systems. Twenty-four Russian attack drones were also used in the salvo, 13 of which were destroyed. The assault appears to be the heaviest bombardment of missile and rocket attacks seen in most of Ukraine since February, targeting power plants, bridges, civilian infrastructure and other locations. It comes two days after an eruption damaged a crucial bridge to Crimea and dealt a strategic blow to the Kremlin. A wounded Vladimir Putin, who has also seen weeks of Russian losses on the battlefield, had been under pressure to respond with force following the explosion, which Putin on Sunday blamed on Kyiv and described as an act of terror. ""It is simply impossible to leave such crimes unanswered,"" Putin said in a brief television appearance on Monday. ""If attempts to carry out terrorist attacks on our territory continue, responses from Russia will be tough and will correspond in scale to the level of threats to the Russian Federation."" At least four explosions were heard in Ukraine's capital during rush hour on Monday morning. A children's playground was among the sites hit by a rocket or missile, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who tweeted images of a smoldering crater in the ground next to the site. In the western city of Lviv, mayor Andriy Sadovyi said an explosion hit ""a critical infrastructure facility."" ""Part of the city is without electricity. A third of the traffic lights do not work,"" Sadovyi said on Telegram, warning civilians to stay inside. Authorities in Sumy, in the northeast of Ukraine, said there were power outages across the region after missile attacks, reporting that ""two missiles hit an infrastructure facility"" in Konotop. Officials in Kharkiv also reported attacks. For several hours on Monday morning Kyiv's subway system was suspended, with underground stations serving as bunkers. But the air raid alert in the city was lifted at midday, as rescue workers sought to pull people from the rubble caused by the strikes. Demys Shmygal, Ukraine's Prime Minister, said Monday that as of 11 a.m. local time, a total of 11 ""crucial infrastructure facilities"" in eight regions had been damaged. As of Monday afternoon, the electricity supply had been cut in Lviv, Poltava, Sumy, and Ternopil, said the Ukrainian State Emergency Services. Electricity was ""partially disrupted"" in the rest of the country. The blasts will be accompanied by concerns that Putin may seek to escalate the conflict in Ukraine, after Moscow's stuttering ground campaign and the damage to the Crimean bridge dealt a major blow to the Russian President. Putin held an operational meeting of his Security Council on Monday, a day after he called the explosions on the Crimea bridge a ""terrorist attack"" and said the organizers and executors were ""Ukrainian special services."" Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the blast on the enormous 19-kilometer (about 12-mile) bridge, which was built after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, an annexation regarded by the West as illegal. The crossing was opened by Putin himself in 2018, and Ukrainian reaction to the explosion has been gleeful and triumphant. The Russian-appointed head of annexed Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said he had ""good news"" Monday, claiming that Russia's approaches to what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine ""have changed."" ""I have been saying from the first day of the special military operation that if such actions to destroy the enemy's infrastructure had been taken every day, we would have finished everything in May and the Kyiv regime would have been defeated,"" he added. Monday's explosions reverberated across central and western Ukraine, far away from the battlefields in the northeast, east and south where a powerful Ukrainian counter-offensive has liberated towns and pushed Russian troops back in recent weeks. Ukraine's defense intelligence agency alleged that Russia had been planning Monday's missile attacks since early last week, before the blast on the bridge. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the strikes showed Putin is ""is desperate because of battlefield defeats and uses missile terror to try to change the pace of war in his favor."" ""They are trying to annihilate us and wipe us off the face of the earth,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram on Monday as the scale of the attacks became clear. ""That's it, in a nutshell. They are trying to slaughter our people who are sleeping in their homes in Zaporizhzhia. They are trying to kill people who are on their way to work in Dnipro and Kyiv."" ""All over Ukraine, the air raid sirens will not abate. Rockets continue to strike. Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded. I ask you: do not leave your shelters. Stay safe and take care of your families. Let's hang in there and be strong,"" Zelensky added. Ukraine's Western allies doubled down on their support for Kyiv following the strikes, with EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell Fontelles tweeting that ""additional military support from the EU is on its way."" US President Joe Biden said Monday's strikes ""once again demonstrate the utter brutality of Mr. Putin's illegal war on the Ukrainian people."" ""These attacks only further reinforce our commitment to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Biden wrote in a statement. ""Alongside our allies and partners, we will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression, hold Putin and Russia accountable for its atrocities and war crimes, and provide the support necessary for Ukrainian forces to defend their country and their freedom."" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the attacks ""another unacceptable escalation of the war and, as always, civilians are paying the highest price."" The G7 group of nations will hold an emergency meeting via video conference on Tuesday, the office of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz confirmed to CNN, and Zelensky said on Twitter that he would address that meeting.",47,1.8024722821864816,4.674592342594006,-2.8721200604075245,25
2022-10-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/europe/kharkiv-bodies-intl/index.html,Ukraine police say bodies of more than 500 civilians found in Kharkiv,"The bodies of more than 500 civilians have been discovered in territory in northeast Ukraine recently retaken from Russian forces, Ukrainian police say. And as Ukrainian forces liberate more land in the northeast, new burial sites are being discovered in Donetsk. Many appear to contain the remains of civilians who lost their lives during several months of shelling and rocket fire. ""We found the bodies of 534 civilians from the de-occupied territories"" in Kharkiv region alone, said Serhii Bolnivov, head of the investigative department of the regional police. The bodies included 226 women and 19 children, Bolvinov added. Most of those recovered - 447 - were found at what he described as a ""mass burial site"" in the town of Izium, which Ukrainian forces liberated from Russian occupation in early September. Russian troops had been using Izium as a launchpad for attacks southward into the Donetsk region. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh visited the site in mid-September. Bolvinov also alleged that more than twenty suspected Russian ""torture chambers"" have been found in the region. ""In almost all large cities and towns, where military units of the Russian army were based, they set up such places of detention of civilians and prisoners of war and tortured them,"" he said, mentioning one in the town of Pisky-Radkivski. ""This is the 22nd torture chamber which we have found and inspected in the de-occupied territory of the Kharkiv region,"" said Bolvinov. He said the most common torture techniques were electric shocks and severe beatings with sticks and other objects. There were also cases of nails being pulled out and the use of gas masks to restrict breathing. Bolvinov said there were also criminal proceedings underway regarding allegations of rape. ""We understand that it is very difficult for victims to testify about such facts. However, there are proceedings that we have registered, there are appeals from women who were raped. We have information about the alleged facts of rapes in torture chambers,"" Bolvinov added. The Ukrainian investigations in Kharkiv follow the discovery of grave human rights abuses by Russian forces north of Kyiv in March. Russia was accused of a litany of war crimes during its unsuccessful campaign to capture Kyiv in the early months of the war. After retreating from Bucha, a suburb of the Ukrainian capital, reports of emerged of Russian forces carrying out summary executions indiscriminate shelling. Bodies were found shot, tied up and left to rot, some bearing signs of torture. In nearby Borodianka, dead civilians were found strewn along the streets. Homes were reportedly ransacked. Moscow has consistently denied its soldiers are responsible for war crimes. In Bucha, the Kremlin claimed -- without evidence -- that the atrocities there were staged. However, witnesses who spoke to CNN said the carnage in the town began after its occupation. A report published in July by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe found that found that the patterns of violent acts by Russian forces in Ukraine meet the qualification of crimes against humanity.",45,4.748123467599631,7.255949693979449,-2.5078262263798186,3
2022-10-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/politics/us-russian-defense-supply-chain-crackdown/index.html,US to host top officials from 30 countries in effort to escalate crackdown on Russian defense supply chains,"Top officials from 30 countries are scheduled to meet next week with senior US sanctions and intelligence officials as the Biden administration continues to escalate its efforts to strangle Russia's military industrial complex. The meeting will serve as a critical opportunity for senior officials from across the Western sanctions coalition to detail where the effort has effectively blocked or shattered critical supply networks, as well as share intelligence and information about ongoing Russian evasion efforts, the official said. ""We're getting together the countries that are really taking action,"" Deputy Treasury Wally Adeyemo told CNN in an interview on the first event of its kind since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. ""We're bringing all 30 countries together to talk about how our attack on Russia's supply chain is going."" The meeting comes at an inflection point in the eight-month conflict as Ukraine continues to notch major battlefield gains and Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to escalate his country's military efforts despite the defeats. US officials and their allies have focused intensively on finding and cracking critical supply chains for a Russian military already facing morale and materiel shortages. It's been an effort driven by US market and intelligence information, as well as significant coordination with officials from the Defense Department and Defense Intelligence Agency who bring significant experience with the shape and critical elements of military supply chains. But the meeting also comes at a moment Russia is desperately engaged in an intensive effort to find work-arounds to the Western coalition's crackdown in order to maintain the effort, even as it has turned to countries like Iran and North Korea for potential supplies and equipment. If the Russian central bank's emergency actions to keep the broader Russian economy afloat amid an avalanche of sanctions marked one key element of the Russian response, the constant search for new shell companies, entities and go-betweens to evade sanctions has been critical to the other. Both have maintained a semblance of productivity despite the scale of the Western efforts, but both face growing pressures -- and atrophying stockpiles and supplies -- each month that passes. The Treasury Department will host the October 14 event, which will be co-led by Adeyemo, Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves and Deputy Director of National Intelligence Morgan Muir. Muir's presence is particularly notable. Adeyemo and Graves serve as point people in the administration's sanctions effort and head up teams engaged daily with coalition members about sanctions efforts. But Muir, representing the intelligence community at the meeting, signals the goal of providing allies with critical information to tighten their own sanctions efforts. A goal of the meeting is ""to provide information to them that many of them have never received before,"" a senior Treasury official said. It's something that underscores the range of participants in the meeting -- and the coalition generally. While G7 countries have served as the critical players in crafting and implementing the sharpest edge of the economic sanctions and export controls, dozens of other nations have played a significant role in shutting off financial and technological avenues for Putin. ""It's important to remember that countries from Asia and around the world have taken actions to constrain the Russian military industrial complex,"" Adeyemo said. US officials, relying on the intelligence community's efforts and extensive assistance from the financial sector, have made tracking those efforts central to their economic war strategy, underscoring the The meeting will be in person on the margins of the annual fall meetings of the IMF and World Bank, and will include representatives at the deputy finance minister level from Baltic nations, Poland, Japan, Cyprus, the European Commission and New Zealand.",20,4.893204283852701,4.08679763967757,0.806406644175131,10
2022-10-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/politics/ukraine-weapons-us-atacms-targeting-veto/index.html,"In bid for new long-range rockets, Ukraine offers US targeting oversight","In an effort to overcome Biden administration resistance to providing it with a new set of powerful, long-range rocket systems, the Ukrainian government is now offering the US full and ongoing visibility into their list of intended Russian targets, multiple officials familiar with the discussions tell CNN. The remarkable transparency essentially gives the US veto power over Ukrainian targeting of Russia and is meant to convince the administration that providing the critical weapons would not lead to strikes inside Russian territory, which the US fears would escalate the war and draw it directly into a conflict with Russian President Vladimir Putin. At issue are the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, surface-to-surface missiles that can fly around 200 miles (300 kilometers), about four times the distance of the rockets used by the HIMARS mobile systems the US began sending to Ukraine four months ago. Despite Ukraine's proposal, the Biden administration still has not approved the new long-range ATACMS weapons, and argues that Ukraine is doing well with the HIMARS systems it currently has. In fact on Wednesday the administration announced funding for 18 more HIMARS for Ukraine, bringing the total to over 30 US systems. There are also concerns inside the administration that providing the longer-range ATACMS weapons would cross a red line in the eyes of Moscow, which would see the US becoming ""a direct party to the conflict."" But that red line is becoming murkier with Friday's annexation of four Ukraine territories by Russia. The US has stated that it will support the use of western weapons inside those zones even if Russia now considers it part of its official territory. Still, the idea of taking a more active role in discussions over Ukrainian targeting raises American fears of being seen as more involved than it would like. Striking deeper into Crimea Ukrainian officials have kept the longer-range ATACMS at the top of their wish list, saying they are ready to be as ""open as needed"" to assuage American concerns and have already listed for the US precisely what they intend to go after. ""We essentially described exactly what specific targets we need to hit on our territory which are not reachable with what we have now,"" said a senior Ukrainian official. ""The categories of targets are clear and do not change."" Among them would be more distant Russian logistical lines, air defense and bases, as well as ammunition depots in Ukraine's east and south, including Crimea, which have become a regular target of the current US-provided rocket systems whose munitions have a maximum range of around 50 miles (80 kilometers). The new rockets would also allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Crimea to target the launching points of Russia's Iranian drones, something it cannot currently do, according to an American source familiar with the country's requests. In pressing the Americans for the longer-range rockets, Ukrainian officials have also dismissed concerns that they would strike Russian territory, arguing they have not done so with the HIMARS systems despite having the range to in some cases. ""We gave assurances that we will not do it [with the HIMARS] and we did not,"" the Ukrainian official said. ""I think the problem is for the US to get over the psychological threshold and approve the [ATACMS] capability."" While the Biden administration has not ruled out sending the ATACAMS eventually, for now they are ""low reward and high risk,"" according to an official familiar with the discussions. Winning with what it has After much lobbying and discussion, Ukraine has made effective use of the HIMARS systems it began receiving in May, particularly in its recent counteroffensive in the east. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made specific mention of the HIMARS systems in discussing Ukraine's recent battlefield success in the Kherson region of the country during an exclusive interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria that aired Sunday on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" Austin said Ukrainian forces have used ""technology like HIMARS"" and employed it in the ""right way"" to ""conduct attacks on things like logistical stores and command and control, that's taking away -- taken away significant capability from the Russians."" US officials have argued the current precision HIMARS munitions, called GMLRS, offer plenty of firepower and range for Ukraine's current needs with the ability to strike the vast majority of Russian targets. ""We believe that we're providing the Ukrainians with the range of capabilities that are commensurate with the fight that they're executing based on the requirements that they've identified for us,"" the Pentagon's Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Sasha Baker said Friday. ""We really believe that the most critical requirements for Ukraine right now is the GMLRS munition that can reach most of the targets that they have identified within Ukrainian territory,"" said Baker. Russia's annexation of Ukrainian land and Putin's nuclear saber-rattling has done little to deter western support for Ukraine's attacks against them to re-claim territory and many officials point to Ukraine's repeated strikes in Crimea -- taken by Russia in 2014 -- as evidence that Russia's threats are bluster. ""Ukraine has the absolute right to defend itself throughout its territory, including to take back the territory that has been illegally seized in one way or another by Russia,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday in response to a question from CNN. ""Because there is no change at all in the territory that is being annexed by the Russians as a matter for us or for the Ukrainians, the Ukrainians will continue to do what they need to do to get back the land that has been taken from them. We will continue to support them in that effort.""",49,3.699592002852037,3.252466056028377,0.4471259468236597,21

Russian President Vladimir Putin is himself giving directions directly to generals in the field, two sources familiar with US and western intelligence said-- a highly unusual management tactic in a modern military that these sources said hints at the dysfunctional command structure that has plagued Russia's war from the beginning. Intelligence intercepts have captured Russian officers arguing among themselves and complaining to friends and relatives back home about decision-making from Moscow, one of these sources told CNN. And there are significant disagreements on strategy with military leaders struggling to agree on where to focus their efforts to shore up defensive lines, multiple sources familiar with US intelligence said. The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed that it is redeploying forces toward Kharkiv in the northeast -- where Ukraine has made the most dramatic gains -- but US and western sources say the bulk of Russian troops still remain in the south, where Ukraine has also mounted offensive operations around Kherson. Putin announced a partial mobilization on Wednesday that is expected to include the call-up of up to 300,000 reservists. He has for months resisted taking that step and Biden administration officials said Wednesday that the fact he has moved to do so now highlights the severity of Russia's manpower shortages and signals a growing desperation. It's not clear that the mobilization will make any operational difference on the battlefield, or merely prolong the length of the war without changing the outcome, according to Russian military analysts. Blame game And while Russia flails on the battlefield, officials in Moscow have scrambled to assign blame for Russia's abrupt turn in fortunes, a senior NATO official said. ""Kremlin officials and state media pundits have been feverishly discussing the reasons for the failure in Kharkiv and in typical fashion, the Kremlin seems to be attempting to deflect the blame away from Putin and onto the Russian military,"" this person said. Already, there has been a reshuffling of military leadership in response to the battlefield failures -- leaving Russia's command structure even more jumbled than it was before, sources say. The commander who oversaw the majority of the units around the Kharkiv region had been in the post only 15 days and has now been relieved of duty, the NATO official said. Russia has sent ""a small number"" of troops into eastern Ukraine -- some of whom had fled amid Ukraine's battlefield advances last week, according to two US defense officials -- an effort to shore up its weakened defensive lines. But even if Russia is able to coalesce around a plan, US and western officials believe Russia is limited in its ability to mount a strategically significant response to Ukraine's counteroffensive operations that in recent days, sources say, has swung the momentum in Kyiv's favor. Even after the announcement of the partial mobilization, officials are skeptical that Russia is capable of quickly deploying large numbers of troops into Ukraine given its ongoing problems with supply lines, communications and morale. The ""small scale"" of the Russian redeployment is a signal of its inability to mount any serious operations, the senior defense official told CNN. So far, Russia has responded to Ukraine's advances by launching attacks against critical infrastructure like dams and power plants -- attacks that the US sees as largely ""revenge"" attacks rather than operationally significant salvos, this person said. Absent more manpower that, right now, it simply doesn't have, sources said Russia has few other options to penalize or push back Ukrainian forces. Putin is ""struggling,"" National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said in an appearance on CNN on Wednesday. Russia's military has ""poor unit cohesion, desertions in the ranks, soldiers not wanting to fight,"" Kirby said. ""He has terrible morale, unit cohesion on the battlefield, command and control has still not been solved. He's got desertion problems and he's forcing the wounded back into the fight. So clearly, manpower is a problem for him,"" Kirby said. ""He feels like he's on his back foot, particularly in that northeast area of the Donbass."" Mobilization order a sign Putin's plan isn't working Putin's mobilization order is significant because it is a direct acknowledgment that Moscow's ""special military operation"" wasn't working and needed to be adjusted, military analysts said. But for now, there are more questions than answers about its precise operational impact. It's the first such order handed down in Russia since World War II, offering military analysts limited modern data on which to base their predictions. Even if Moscow can grow its number of soldiers -- both by preventing existing contract service members from leaving service and by mobilizing reservists -- it will struggle to train, equip and integrate these troops into existing units, said Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses. And even if that solves some near-term manpower problems, these will likely not be high-quality recruits, Kofman and others noted. Even in the best-case scenario, it will also take Moscow some time to field fresh troops. ""I think it's reasonable to say that partial mobilization probably will not reflect itself on the battlefield for several months at the earliest, and could expand Russia's ability to sustain this war, but not alter its outcome,"" Kofman said. Russia's longstanding failures in planning, communications and logistics have been compounded by punishing losses in its retreat from around Kharkiv, sources said. Russia left behind ""a lot"" of equipment in its retreat, according to the NATO official. And at least one storied unit, from the First Guards Tank Army, has been ""decimated,"" this person said. ""With its northern axis all but collapsed, this will make it harder for Russian forces to slow the Ukrainian advance, as well as to provide cover for the retreating Russian troops,"" the official said. ""We think it will also severely impair Russia's plans to occupy the entirety of the Donbas."" The wild card remains, as always, the Russian President. Putin on Wednesday once again threatened the use of nuclear weapons, a threat the US officials have said they are taking ""seriously"" but have seen no immediate indication he is planning on following through on. Pro-Russian authorities in some eastern occupied regions of Ukraine have also announced their intention to hold political referendums on joining Russia, a maneuver some analysts say Russia could use as a pretext for military action. But, the senior NATO official said, ""Overall, Russia now finds itself on the defensive. Ukraine has the initiative, forcing Russia to take stopgap measures simply to avoid further losses."" ""If Ukraine succeeds in undertaking sustained defensive operations, this could even further undermine the sustainability of Russian defenses,"" this person said.",7,3.5002521589250195,1.441733019347558,2.0585191395774616,13
2022-09-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/europe/russia-mobilization-logistics-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"Putin can call up all the troops he wants, but Russia can't train or support them","Vladimir Putin can call up all the troops he wants, but Russia has no way of getting those new troops the training and weapons they need to fight in Ukraine any time soon. With his invasion of Ukraine faltering badly, the Russian President on Wednesday announced the immediate ""partial mobilization"" of Russian citizens. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Russian television that the country will call up 300,000 reservists. If they end up facing Ukrainian guns on the front lines, they are likely to become the newest casualties in the invasion Putin started more than seven months ago and that has seen the Russian military fail at almost every aspect of modern war. ""The Russian military is not currently equipped to rapidly and effectively deploy 300,000 reservists,"" said Alex Lord, Europe and Eurasia specialist at the Sibylline strategic analysis firm in London. ""Russia is already struggling to effectively equip its professional forces in Ukraine, following significant equipment losses during the war,"" Lord said. The recent Ukrainian offensive, which has seen Kyiv recapture thousands of square meters of territory, has taken a significant toll. The Institute for the Study of War earlier this week said analysis from Western experts and Ukrainian intelligence found Russia had lost 50% to 90% of its strength in some units due to that offensive, and vast amounts of armor. And that comes on top of staggering equipment losses over the course of the war. The open source intelligence website Oryx, using only losses confirmed by photographic or video evidence, has found Russian forces have lost more than 6,300 vehicles, including 1,168 tanks, since the fighting began. ""In practice, they don't have enough modern equipment ... for that many new troops,"" said Jakub Janovsky, a military analyst who contributes to the Oryx blog. JT Crump, CEO of Sibylline and a veteran of 20 years in the British military, said Russia is beginning to suffer ammunition shortages in some calibers and is looking for sources of key components so it can repair or build replacements for weapons lost on the battlefield. It's not just tanks and armored personnel carriers that have been lost. In many cases, Russian troops haven't had the basics in Ukraine, including a clear definition of what they are risking their lives for. Despite Wednesday's mobilization order, Putin is still calling Ukraine a ""special military operation,"" not a war. Ukrainian soldiers know they are fighting for their homeland. Many Russian soldiers have no idea why they are in Ukraine. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis noted this on Wednesday, calling Putin's partial mobilization announcement ""a sign of desperation."" ""I think that people definitely do not want to go to a war that they do not understand. ... People would be taken to jail if they were to call Russia's war in Ukraine a war, and now suddenly they have to go in and fight it unprepared, without weapons, without body armor, without helmets,"" he said. But even if they did have all the equipment, weapons and motivation they need, getting 300,000 troops quickly trained for battle would be impossible, experts said. ""Neither the extra officers nor facilities necessary for a mass mobilization exist now in Russia,"" said Trent Telenko, a former quality control auditor for the US' Defense Contract Management Agency who has studied Russian logistics. Reforms in 2008, aimed at modernizing and professionalizing the Russian military, removed many of the logistical and command and control structures that had once enabled the forces of the old Soviet Union to rapidly train and equip vast numbers of mobilized conscripts. Lord, at Sibylline, said it would take at least three months to gather, train and deploy Russian reservists. ""At which time we will be in the depths of a Ukrainian winter,"" Lord said. ""As such, we're unlikely to see an influx of reservists have a serious impact on the battlefield until spring 2023 -- and even then they are likely to be poorly trained and ill-equipped."" Mark Hertling, a former US Army general and CNN analyst, said he had seen firsthand how poor Russian training could be during visits to the country. ""It was awful...rudimentary first aid, very few simulations to conserve resources, and...most importantly...horrible leadership,"" Hertling wrote on Twitter. ""Placing 'newbies' on a front line that has been mauled, has low morale and who don't want to be (there) portends more (Russian) disaster. ""Jaw-dropping,"" Hertling tweeted. Telenko said newly mobilized troops would likely become just the latest casualties in Putin's war. ""Russia can draft bodies. It can't rapidly train, equip and most importantly lead them. ""Untrained waves of 20 to 50 something men with AK something assault rifles and no radios will fall apart at the first Ukrainian artillery or armored attack,"" he said.",7,1.7234972518313618,1.9716963481674146,-0.24819909633605275,13
2022-09-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/europe/ukraine-russia-winter-lister-cotovio-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html,Winter is fast approaching in Ukraine. Here's what comes next for the conflict,"Until a few weeks ago, it looked as though the conflict in Ukraine would head into the bitter winter months frozen in place -- with neither side making appreciable progress. That prognosis has changed with the sudden and successful Ukrainian offensive through most of occupied Kharkiv, which has galvanized Ukraine's Western backers as much as it has led to recriminations in Moscow. The Russian military must now ask itself what sort of force, and where exactly they are deployed, can regain the initiative after Ukraine captured more territory in one week than Russian forces had in five months. There are important political dynamics involved too. The Kremlin faces tough choices: whether to declare a general mobilization to reinvigorate its increasingly ragged units in Ukraine and how to manage a budget deficit -- even though it's sitting on historically high foreign reserves. Far beyond the theater of war, Russia must choose how far to weaponize its influence over Europe's gas supply, as governments prepare to spend big to mitigate the effects of exceptionally tight supply. Another potential dilemma: the first signs that Chinese support for the Russian invasion, never whole-hearted, may be waning. A changing battlefield Ukraine's stunning counter-offensive across Kharkiv, combined with more attritional advances in the south, have presented the Kremlin and Russia's much criticized Defense Ministry with a range of bad options. As winter approaches, they must choose which front to prioritize, and whether to double down on efforts to fulfill Putin's stated objective: the seizure of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The Russians currently hold about 20% of Ukrainian land, including Crimea and parts of the south. Taking Donetsk is a taller order now for the Russians. Seven months of war have shown the shortcomings in Russian logistics, which will get no easier in wetter, colder weather. In a matter of days, Russia lost one of three axes of attack in Donetsk; no progress has been made on the other two since the end of June. At the same time, Russian defenses in Kherson are under growing pressure despite being reinforced, thanks to Ukraine's success in cutting off resupply across the River Dnipro and in targeting command posts and ammunition depots. The Russian military does not have a wealth of fresh units to inject into the conflict. The recently stood-up 3rd Army Corps largely comprises volunteer battalions recruited across the Russian regions. Other battalion tactical groups have been reconstituted after suffering heavy losses. There are persistent reports of discipline fraying among Russian units. The disorderly retreat in Kharkiv, with vast amounts of military hardware abandoned, is testament to that -- and to chronic command problems that will not be remedied overnight. Obviously, Ukraine has also lost thousands of soldiers, including many from its best units in Donbas. And a NATO military official told CNN that while the sweep across Ukraine had been a major boost for morale, ""I can't imagine the same thing happening twice."" And Russia's artillery and rocket forces still vastly outnumber those of Ukraine. But it's been unable to leverage this superiority into gains on the ground. Some 40% of Donetsk remains under Ukrainian control. President Vladimir Putin acknowledged this on Friday -- saying that the offensive operation in the Donbas ""goes at a slow pace, but it keeps going. Gradually, gradually, the Russian army occupies new territories."" And despite calls in Moscow for a general mobilization, this still seems unlikely. Putin said: ""We are fighting with only part of the Russian army, the part that's on contract ...Therefore, we are not in a hurry on this part."" A Ukrainian victory? Some observers have begun to ask whether a Ukrainian victory is conceivable. That depends on how victory is defined. It is President Zelensky's stated intention to recover all occupied territories as well as Crimea. General David Petraeus, former CIA Director and commander of US military forces in Iraq, said he expected Ukraine to retake territory seized by the Russians since February, and ""it's even conceivable they could retake Crimea and the Donbas,"" aided by growing resistance in occupied areas. But that would take time and involve tough fighting, Petraeus told CNN. If that were Ukraine's goal, its supply lines would be stretched and its better units spread thin. In turn, Ukrainian forces would be vulnerable to counter-attacks. Ultimately, Ukraine's battlefield success will depend on a continuing and expanded supply of Western hardware. Meetings in the next few weeks will determine what's in that pipeline, but inventories in several countries are dwindling. US officials are also wary that Ukraine might overplay its hand. The US is still exceptionally cautious about sending Ukraine weapons that have a range of more than 80 kilometers (nearly 50 miles) and could therefore strike deep inside Russia. It has so far resisted Ukrainian requests for long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) that have a range of up to 300 kilometers. Some Western officials fear humiliation for the Kremlin might provoke an unpredictable reaction, even including tactical nuclear weapons. A former NATO deputy secretary-general, Rose Gottemoeller, told the BBC this week: ""I do worry about that kind of scenario at the moment... The goal would be to try to get the Ukrainians in their terror to capitulate."" Back in February, on the eve of the invasion, Putin warned that any country standing in Russia's way would face ""consequences such as they have never seen in their history."" But Olga Olika, director of the Europe and Central Asia Program at the International Crisis Group, believes the Kremlin would not countenance such an escalation because ""detonating weapons of mass destruction would provoke international retaliation, including, quite possibly, direct military involvement from NATO."" US President Joe Biden appeared to confirm this in a ""60 Minutes"" interview -- a clip of which aired on CBS Evening News on Friday. He warned Putin against escalating the fighting further in Ukraine, saying that there will be consequences if the Kremlin used chemical or nuclear weapons in the fighting. ""Don't. Don't. Don't. It would change the face of war unlike anything since World War II,"" Biden said. Asked by Scott Pelley what the US response would be if Russia used a chemical or nuclear weapon, Biden said it would be ""consequential."" Other analysts point out that the use of tactical nuclear weapons would hav​e limited military benefits, and that the military might even defy an order from Putin for their use. ""It is hard to imagine that even nuclear strikes would allow Russia to break Ukraine's will to resist,"" said General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's Armed Forces commander in chief. Russia still has an intimidating arsenal of ballistic and other missiles that could be used not to gain territory but to inflict catastrophic damage on Ukraine's infrastructure: power, water and communications. On Russian state television, pundits have argued for Ukraine's power and water infrastructure to be destroyed. And there have been signs of Russian missile forces doing just that -- with attacks on power supplies in Kharkiv and hydraulic gates on a reservoir in Kryviy Rih in recent days. Nevertheless, the trajectory of the war looks different heading into the final months of a year that began with few hopes Ukraine could resist the Russian behemoth. That in itself may stiffen the backbone of European support -- and spur the continuing pipeline of military aid -- despite an expensive winter of discontent over heating and fuel prices. The gas gambit It's long been evident that part of the Kremlin's strategy is to knee-cap European resolve in supporting Ukraine by plunging it into an energy crisis, literally turning off the gas taps. At a forum in Vladivostok earlier this month, Putin said: ""We will not supply anything at all if it is contrary to our interests. No gas, no oil, no coal, no fuel oil, nothing."" Amid setbacks on the battlefield, Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay write in Foreign Affairs that ""Putin's best hope — perhaps his only hope — is that Western support for Ukraine will crumble as the costs of war, including energy shortages and rising prices, begin to hit home in Europe."" Natural gas prices in Europe are 10 times higher than a year ago, earning Russia about $1 billion a day in the first three months of the conflict from energy exports. And the sanctions regime against Russia will only have significant impact in the longer-term, because the Russian economy is so self-contained. But the coming winter will be the acid test of Moscow's energy squeeze. Rather than looking for compromise, European governments have concluded that concessions would only embolden the Kremlin. They are set on heavy spending to protect consumers and a longer-term strategy to reduce dependence on Russian energy. After scouring the world for alternative suppliers, they have built up reserves (in France's case to more than 90% of capacity). Even though wholesale gas prices are still numbingly high, they have fallen by about one-third in the last three weeks. Some analysts think they will further do so, reducing the cost of subsidies being introduced by European governments already strapped for cash. There are also signs that Russia's windfall from sky-high oil and gas prices may have peaked. The International Energy Agency forecasts that Russian oil production will be 17% lower by next February compared to pre-war output, once the full force of EU sanctions are felt. Daalder and Lindsay believe Ukraine's allies have set their course. ""Many skeptics in the West believe democracies will buckle in the face of hardship,"" they wrote. ""But such voices underestimate the West's staying power."" No doves of peace The signals from both sides indicate they are digging in for a long winter, rather than exploring prospects for a settlement. ""Russia will do everything to end the conflict in Ukraine as quickly as possible, but Kyiv refuses to negotiate,"" Putin said at a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. In the meantime, Russia's goal was still ""the liberation of Donbas"" and there was ""no hurry."" But the Russian leader also acknowledged the ""concerns"" that both India and China have about the conflict. Chinese leader Xi Jinping, in his first meeting with Putin since before the invasion, notably did not refer to Ukraine by name, according to a read-out from Beijing. Some observers believe Beijing is subtly adopting an arm's length approach to the Russian quagmire in Ukraine. How that may play into Putin's calculations is as yet unknown. For their part, the Ukrainians have been consistent about not negotiating with Moscow unless and until all occupied territor",7,1.4522387790305147,3.6874658616579565,-2.235227082627442,13

Ukraine's Defense Ministry said at least 440 ""unmarked"" graves were found in the city in recent days. The country's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that some of the bodies found in Izium showed ""signs of torture,"" blaming Russia for what he called ""cruelty and terrorism."" Zelensky posted a photograph of the ongoing exhumation of bodies at a mass burial site near the city of Izium. In a text accompanying the photograph on his Telegram channel, Zelensky wrote: ""The whole world should see this. A world in which there should be no cruelty and terrorism. But all this is there. And its name is Russia."" Izium was subject to intense Russian artillery attacks in April. The city, which sits near the border between the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, became an important hub for the invading military during five months of occupation. Ukrainian forces took back control of the city on Saturday, delivering a strategic blow to Russia's military assault in the east. When CNN arrived to the mass burial site on Friday afternoon, officials were transporting body bags, including one that appeared to be holding something very small, into a refrigerated truck. Most graves at the burial site are individual graves, with wooden crosses placed at the head of the dirt mounds. Some with names and numbers handwritten on them. One had a number as high as 398. Another with the name of an 82-year-old man. One official at the site told CNN that investigations would have to determine when these people died. Further down in the forest lies what appeared to be a former military position, with tank positions dug deep into the ground. A policeman at the scene told CNN that the spot is a mass grave where 17 bodies were found. ""Here are civilian bodies and military ones further along,"" Igor Garmash, an investigator at the scene said of the specific part of the site he was examining, pointing to a location nearby. ""Over 20 bodies have been examined and sent for further investigation,"" he told CNN. Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications said on Thursday that some of the graves discovered at Izium were ""fresh,"" and that the corpses buried there were ""mostly civilians."" Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian Parliament's Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a video statement from the site that ""there is a whole family right next to me... This is a young family... The father was born in 1988, the wife was born in 1991, their little daughter was born in 2016."" He said local people told the investigators that the family had died in a Russian airstrike. ""Also we saw here a mass burial of servicemen of the Ukrainian army. The way they were buried -- you will see evidence that their hands were tied, they were killed at close range,"" Lubinets said. An Izium resident living across the street from the mass burial site told CNN the Russians first hit a nearby city graveyard with an airstrike and then moved in. ""They brought their special machines. They dug some trenches for their vehicles. We only heard how they were destroying the forest,"" Nadezhda Kalinichenko told CNN. She said she tried not to go out during the time the city was under the Russian occupation because she was too scared. ""When they left, I don't know if there was fighting or not. We just heard a lot of heavy trucks one night a week ago,"" she said. 'Bloody brutal terror' Zelensky said during his address on Thursday that Russia must be held accountable for deaths there, and in other cities where large numbers of bodies had been found. ""Bucha, Mariupol and now, unfortunately, Izium... Russia leaves death everywhere. And must be responsible for it. The world must hold Russia to real responsibility for this war. We will do everything for this,"" he added. The Governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said that ""the scale of the crimes committed by the invaders in Izium is enormous. This is bloody brutal terror."" Syniehubov said that ""450 bodies of civilians with traces of violent death and torture were buried in a forest belt. It is difficult to imagine something like this in the 21st century, but now it is a tragic reality in Izium."" Syniehubov said that among the bodies exhumed on Friday ""99 percent showed signs of violent death."" ""There are several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person is buried with a rope around his neck. Obviously, these people were tortured and executed. There are also children among the buried,"" he said. Meanwhile, Oleh Kotenko, Ukraine's commissioner for missing persons, said in a Telegram post that search operations for the remains of ""fallen heroes"" were proceeding cautiously throughout the region. ""The biggest problem is that some areas are still mined. Despite this, we continue to work, because we have to return each hero home so that the families can honor the memory of the soldiers who died for Ukraine in a dignified manner as soon as possible,"" Kotenko said. Zelensky visited Izium on Wednesday and told journalists he was ""shocked"" by the number of ""destroyed buildings"" and ""killed people"" left in the wake of the Russian occupation. In his nightly address on Friday, Zelensky said exhumation of the bodies at the mass burial site was continuing and it was still ""too early to speak about the total number of people buried there."" He added that investigations were taking place in all areas of the country that had been recaptured from Russian forces and that a number of civilians, including foreigners, who had been held captive in occupied cities and towns had been found alive. Among the foreigners rescued were seven students from Sri Lanka, he said. They were studying in Kupyansk Medical College but were captured by Russian soldiers back in March and held in a basement. ""Only now, after the liberation of Kharkiv region, these people were rescued and are being provided proper medical care,"" Zelensky said. A United Nations source has told CNN that a team from the UN's human rights monitoring agency -- the OCHR -- would be going to Izium and areas around it as soon as possible. The War Crimes investigation team may follow after that, the source said. Their specific destination remains unclear at this time. Moscow was using Izium as a launching pad for attacks southward into the Donetsk region and Kupyansk, some 48 kilometers (30 miles) to the north of Izium, and as a rail hub to resupply its forces. Zelensky also thanked foreign governments for sending investigators and prosecutors to investigate alleged human rights abuses by occupying forces in Ukraine, adding that all occupied areas would eventually return. Ukrainian forces have been on a sustained military offensive, particularly in the country's northeast and southern regions. Zelensky said on Tuesday that 8,000 square kilometers (3,088 square miles) of territory had now been liberated by Ukrainian forces so far this month, with roughly half the area still undergoing ""stabilization"" measures.",45,4.057713490468396,5.408502968841773,-1.3507894783733772,3
2022-09-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/politics/us-ukraine-aid-weapons/index.html,"US sees the aid its given Ukraine as effective, likely won't provide longer-range systems for now","The Biden administration is unlikely to significantly change its approach to helping Ukraine fight Russia, sources tell CNN, and is rebuffing some Ukrainian weapons requests for now -- even as Ukrainian forces have made sweeping gains and recaptured thousands of miles of territory from Russia in recent days. US officials broadly view Ukraine's recent momentum as evidence that the types of weapons and intelligence that the West has been providing to Ukraine in recent months has been effective. And some caution that it's too early to call Ukraine's rapid progress in recent days a turning point in the war, warning that Russia is far from a spent force militarily. Officials do not believe the battlefield landscape has changed enough to warrant a dramatic strategy shift in the short term despite recent Ukrainian requests to lawmakers and the Pentagon for long-range missile systems and tanks, which they assert can help them sustain the push for longer and keep the territory they have regained. But for now, at least, the US is still not inclined to provide Ukrainian forces with the long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, also known as ATACMS, that they have been requesting for months, officials told CNN. ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers, or around 185 miles. The administration still believes providing those systems could be escalatory because they could be used to fire into Russia itself. Currently, the maximum range of US-provided weapons to Ukraine is around 49 miles. ""It's our assessment that they don't currently require ATACMS to service targets that are directly relevant to the current fight,"" Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters in late-August. Last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin intimated the US position hasn't shifted. ""The HIMARS, using the GMLRS rockets, have been extraordinary in terms of enabling the Ukrainians to service the targets that they need to service inside of Ukraine,"" Austin said in Prague on Friday, making no mention of ATACMS. Since the beginning of the conflict in February, the Biden administration has taken an incremental approach to providing arms to Ukraine -- in some cases, later agreeing to send weapons that earlier in the conflict would have been deemed far too escalatory. Its calculus has largely been based on avoiding systems that might be seen by Putin as too provocative, although those lines have moved over time and been criticized by some former officials as arbitrary. Some US military officials also acknowledged that systems currently considered too escalatory -- like F-16 jets, for example -- might eventually be provided to Ukraine. But those sources cautioned that such a decision is likely far in the future and isn't linked to Ukraine's recent, but nascent, successes. And there are no indications that such discussions are underway now. ""Ukraine has made some progress, but there's still a very tough fight, and a tough fight ahead, so I think we also need to keep that in mind,"" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Tuesday. ""I think it is reasonable over time to continue, as we have, that dialogue to hear what their needs are, to work with the international community."" US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby echoed that, telling reporters that the US would likely announce additional military assistance to Ukraine in the coming days but declined to outline that aid in detail. Another defense official told CNN on Tuesday that the longer-range equipment is likely still off the table for now because Ukraine is ""still in the sweet spot on HIMARS,"" or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems that the US and some of its allies provided to Ukraine over the summer. The munitions for those systems, provided by the US, are capable of using GPS-guidance to strike a target with precision some 40 miles away. Ukrainian forces have received ""thousands"" of GMLRS rounds, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said last week, and used them to strike Russian ammo depots, logistical hubs and command posts. Still, some lawmakers disagree with the administration's cautious approach. Asked whether he believes the US should send the ATACMS, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida told CNN, ""I think we should send them anything they need to reclaim their territory, to the extent that we have it available, and it is reasonable."" ""I think the concern some would say is that the longer-range missiles could target deep inside of Russia and trigger a broader conflict. I'm not sure I'm as troubled by that,"" Rubio added. US officials cautious on state of the war The US has also been careful not to call the rapid Ukrainian territorial gains a turning point in the war, or a critical moment that will decide the outcome for good. ""It's more important than ever that we don't appear to be spiking the ball,"" a defense official said. The Russians still have a tremendous amount of firepower, manpower and equipment in the fight in Ukraine, and the victories this month of the Ukrainian military have not sealed the outcome of the war. In military terms, Russia still has ""mass,"" even if it has been unable to bring that to bear at a critical time and place to shape the outcome of a particular fight. Still, the Ukrainian counteroffensive -- planned with US assistance -- does appear to have been ""expertly executed,"" the official said. One thing that has changed in the last several months is the Ukrainians' willingness to share intelligence with the US, allowing American officials to better help the Ukrainians shape their battlefield operations. ""There's a lot more trust now than there was at the beginning of the war,"" said one Ukrainian source close to President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""And the Ukrainians recognize that the more they share, the more they are likely to get in return."" A US military source added that there has been ""decent communication at varying levels about what's being planned on the political side and the military side. There's pretty good military transparency."" In Kherson, where Ukraine telegraphed its intentions for months before the counteroffensive began, Russia had time to prepare, digging in to protect the territory around one of the first cities they occupied early in the war. Ukraine's advances there have been incremental and deliberate, one official said, and there is no rapid advance through collapsing Russian lines. Some analysts have described the Kherson offensive as a ""fixing"" operation designed to keep Russian troops engaged away from the fight in Kharkiv. In Kharkiv, however, the attack caught the Russians by surprise and without any well-prepared defenses, allowing the Ukrainian military to rapidly reclaim thousands of square miles of territory. Russia has so far failed to meaningfully stop the counteroffensive in Ukraine's south or east as the problems they had early in the war -- supply line issues, logistical problems, and a lack of effective command and control -- still plague the Russian military, officials said. Russia proved unable to hold the territory it had seized, partially because of the high cost imposed on them by Ukrainian defenders. The US is less concerned about Ukraine's ability to hold reclaimed territory, officials said, even in the east, where Ukrainian forces have moved more than 60 kilometers within days in some cases. Ukraine's supply lines are internal, whereas Russia's were outside its own borders. In addition, Ukraine's forces will get a significant boost to morale and will from the recent victories, one official said, while Russia's depleted forces will feel the opposite. It's ""not a real concern of [Ukraine] overstretching supply lines,"" an official said.

2022-09-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/europe/ukraine-advance-russia-war-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,The rot runs deep in the Russian war machine. Ukraine is exposing it for all to see,"For Russia, the numbers are catastrophic. From Wednesday to Sunday, Vladimir Putin's military forces saw at least 338 pieces of important military hardware -- from fighter jets to tanks to trucks -- destroyed, damaged or captured, according to numbers from the open source intelligence website Oryx, as Ukraine's forces have bolted through Russian-held territory in an offensive that has stunned the Russians in its speed and breadth. Ukraine's top military commander claimed on Sunday that more than 3,000 square kilometers (1,158 square miles) of territory had been retaken by his country's forces since the beginning of September. And for more perspective, just ""since Wednesday, Ukraine has recaptured territory at least twice the size of Greater London,"" the British Defense Ministry said Monday. Ukrainian reports say Putin's troops are fleeing east to the Russian border in whatever transport they can find, even taking cars from the civilian population in the areas they had captured since the start of the war in February. In their wake they leave hundreds of pieces of the Russian war machine, which since Putin's so-called ""special military operation"" commenced, has not come close to living up to its pre-war billing as one of the world's great powers. These Russian losses are the accumulation of a multitude of existing problems that are now colliding head-on with a Ukrainian military that has been patient, methodical and infused with billions of dollars of Western military equipment that Russia cannot match. And without a drastic, and potentially unconventional intervention from Putin, the Ukrainian victories are likely to accelerate, analysts say. Many of Russia's problems -- poor and inflexible leadership, sour troop morale, inadequate logistics and hardware beset by maintenance issues -- have been evident since the beginning stages of the war more than seven months ago. The Russian military's hollow core -- including tanks that were easy prey for Ukrainian ground troops and trucks that didn't have the right tires to traverse Ukraine's landscape -- was quickly exposed by tactics ill-suited to the blitzkrieg Putin had planned. Remember that 64-kilometer (40-mile) convoy that stalled on the way to the capital of Kyiv and was shredded by Ukrainian defenders? As that convoy stalled, reports filtered out that Russian troops had significant morale problems -- some didn't even know they were in Ukraine, or if they did, why they were there. As the fighting intensified, Ukrainian forces targeted Russian leadership, killing generals and colonels who would have been expected to rally the Russian forces. And the Russians certainly needed stronger leadership if accounts of troop hardships are to be believed. Pavel Filatyev, a Russian paratrooper who fought his army's capture of the Ukrainian city of Kherson earlier in the war, told CNN last month that his unit lacked even the basics during that operation. ""Several days after we encircled Kherson many of us did not have any food, water or sleeping sacks,"" he said. ""Because it was very cold at night, we couldn't even sleep. We would find some rubbish, some rags, just to wrap ourselves to keep warm."" And their armaments were substandard, he said. ""All of our weapons are from the times of Afghanistan,"" where Russian forces fought from 1979 to 1989, he said. The impact of Western arms donations Meanwhile, Western arms have flowed into Ukraine, among them powerful advanced artillery systems like the HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. The wheeled HIMARS offer what US manufacturer Lockheed Martin calls ""shoot and scoot capability"" -- they can fire highly accurate rockets at targets about 70 to 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) away and then move quickly to avoid any counterstrike. Ukraine has used them with devastating effect on Russian supply lines, ammunition dumps and command posts. ""Ukraine's armed forces employed HIMARS and other Western systems to attack Russian ground lines of communication in Kharkiv and Kherson Oblasts, setting conditions for the success of this operation,"" the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in a blog post on Sunday. The pounding meted out by Ukrainian deployed HIMARS on Russian supply lines has been relentless, according to Western analysts. ""Ukrainian long-range artillery is now probably hitting crossings of the Dnipro (River) so frequently that Russia cannot carry out repairs to damaged road bridges,"" Britain's Defense Ministry said Monday. Trent Telenko, a former quality control auditor for the US' Defense Contract Management Agency who has studied Russian logistics, said Ukrainian forces used precision rockets fired from the HIMARS batteries to take out key large Russian arms depots near rail lines well back of the front lines. This meant Russia had to use trucks to disperse artillery pieces and ammunition to smaller depots, making it more difficult to distribute, Telenko said. When Ukraine began its lightning offensive, Russia could not bring appropriate firepower to blunt the Ukrainian advance because its artillery was so dispersed, he said. But the HIMARS and other powerful Western artillery systems shouldn't get all the credit, ISW said. They were coupled with Ukrainian feints and ingenuity. Last week Russia redeployed forces to the south to bolster its ranks ahead of a mooted Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson region, according to Ukrainian officials and footage of equipment moving through Crimea. That opened the door for Ukrainian forces farther north. ""Kyiv's long discussion and then an announcement of a counter-offensive operation aimed at Kherson Oblast drew substantial Russian troops away from the sectors on which Ukrainian forces have conducted decisive attacks in the past several days,"" ISW said. Once those Russian forces moved, the Ukrainian military probed for weak points in Russian lines, said Mark Hertling, a CNN analyst and former US Army general. ""What they have been able to do is conduct reconnaissance with a small force to find where to conduct a much larger breakthrough, pushing tanks and artillery through the holes in the Russian front and then getting into the Russian rear areas,"" Hertling said. Supplies for Ukraine to fuel its advance The quick Russian retreat has enabled Ukraine to capture Russian arms, ammunition, fuel and supplies in those rear areas, said Telenko, adding that the addition of trucks and trains to the Ukrainian inventory will allow Kyiv to ""supercharge"" its advances. Analysts have also noted the lack of Russian air support. Richard Hooker Jr., a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, said last month that Ukraine has stitched together a force of older antiaircraft systems already in its inventory with supplies of US and German equipment and ""largely sidelined Russian airpower."" ""Ukraine has been outstandingly successful in denying Russia air supremacy with extremely effective air defense and a strategy of 'air denial,'"" Hooper wrote on the Atlantic Council's ""Ukraine Alert"" blog. And Russian setbacks are just fuel for even more trouble ahead, a spiral of defeats that may be beyond Moscow's ability to stop. Mick Ryan, an adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Australian Army general, terms it ""cascading failure"" in a Twitter post. ""Each battlefield loss and withdrawal leads to further failure,"" he said. As the options dwindle, so will embattled Russian morale. As retreating forces move back, they'll bring stories of their withdrawal with them. It will be all but impossible for the Kremlin to keep those stories from spreading within its forces and even to their relatives back home. The territory Russia captured in Ukraine over seven months, at the cost of tens of thousands of Russian casualties, has been lost in a week. And Russia's generals seemingly have no immediate answer. Even when Putin's forces were advancing, those advances were slow and grinding. And earlier in the war, Ukraine's defenders never fled the way Russian troops have in the past week. ""The already limited trust deployed troops have in Russia's senior military leadership is likely to deteriorate further,"" the British Defense Ministry said on Monday. The ministry's report said the Ukrainian attacks had made it difficult for Russia to move replacement troops to the front lines. Where does Moscow find replacements? The big question is whether Russia has fresh trained troops to move forward. In July, CNN reported that the call had gone out across Russia for more than 30,000 volunteers to join the war effort in Ukraine. The lure was big cash bonuses and no experience was necessary. But Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at ISW, said those new recruits would likely be of little help on the battlefield as there would not be enough time to train them. For instance, training a tank crew can take several months at a minimum and sometimes more than a year, experts say. ""Short-term training is unlikely to turn volunteers with no prior experience into effective soldiers in any unit,"" Stepanenko said. And those 300-plus Russian pieces of hardware left destroyed, damaged or abandoned on the battlefield over the past several days won't be easy to replace either. Russian industry has been hamstrung by Western sanctions. Russian arms depots have already been raided to replace earlier losses. And while large numbers of arms may remain in those depots, they are likely old and in need of repair or refurbishment, said Jakub Janovsky, a military analyst who contributes to the Oryx blog. ""In practice replacements are often much older vehicles -- likely to suffer from reliability problems and with lower effectiveness in combat,"" he said. Moscow retains manufacturing capacity, but lacks the best components for what it might make, Janovsky said. ""Due to sanctions they might have to replace sensors and electronics with inferior alternatives -- and the amount they can produce in the near term is a fraction of what they are losing. Those material losses ... are not sustainable,"" he said. So advantage Ukraine, at least in the near term. But Ryan, the former Australian general, remains cautious. ""It is too early to speak in overly triumphant terms. The Russians still have the capacity to respond. The south & east are still occupied by the Russians. The Ukrainians have won a significant victory, but there is still a war to be won,"" he tweeted.",7,2.3646735136675225,2.0715456135548633,0.2931279001126592,13
2022-09-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/11/europe/ukraine-russia-eastern-front/index.html,Russia's collapse in northeast Ukraine ignites fury from Putin loyalists,"The last week has seen a stunning transformation of the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, as a swift armored offensive by Ukrainian forces rolled through lines of Russian defenses and recaptured more than 3,000 square kilometers (more than 1,100 square miles) of territory. That is more territory than Russian forces have captured in all their operations in Ukraine since April. As much as the offensive was brilliantly conceived and executed, it also succeeded because of Russian inadequacies. Throughout swathes of the Kharkiv region, Russian units were poorly organized and equipped -- and many offered little resistance. Their failures, and their disorderly retreat to the east, has made the goal of President Vladimir Putin's special military operation to take all of Luhansk and Donetsk regions considerably harder to attain. Over the weekend, the Russian retreat continued from border areas that had been occupied since March. Villages within five kilometers of the border were raising the Ukrainian flag. Live updates: Russia's war in Ukraine The collapse of Russian defenses has ignited recriminations among influential Russian military bloggers and personalities in Russian state media. As the Ukrainian flag was raised in one community after another over the last several days, one question came into focus: how does the Kremlin respond? A lightning operation Ukrainian officials had telegraphed that an offensive was imminent -- but not where it actually happened. There was plenty of noise about a counter-attack in the south, and even US officials talked about Ukrainian operations to ""shape the battlefield"" in Kherson. Russian reinforcements -- perhaps as many as 10,000 -- streamed into the region over a period of weeks. There was indeed a Ukrainian assault in Kherson, but one whose intention appears to have been to fix Russian forces, while the real effort came hundreds of miles to the north. It was a disinformation operation the Russians might have been proud of. Kateryna Stepanenko at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based analytical group, says the deception worked. ""Ukrainian military officials reported that (Russian) Eastern Military District elements that had previously supported offensive operations towards Sloviansk had redeployed to the Southern Axis,"" she told CNN. Their replacements were clearly not up to the job -- a mixed bag, Stepanenko said, of ""Cossack volunteers, volunteer units, DNR/LNR militia units, and the Russian Rosgvardia (National Guard). Such forces were not sufficient to defend a vast and complex front line."" The Ukrainians picked the weakest spot in Russian defenses for their initial thrust -- an area controlled by the Luhansk militia with Russian National Guard units further back. They were no match for a highly mobile armored assault that quickly rendered artillery irrelevant. Igor Strelkov, formerly the head of the Donetsk People's Republic militia and now a caustic critic of Russian military shortcomings, noted the poor training of these units and ""the exceptional caution of the actions of Russian aviation."" In short, Russian front-line units were hung out to dry without sufficient air support. Multiple videos geolocated and analyzed by CNN, as well as local accounts, depict a chaotic withdrawal of Russian units, with large amounts of ammunition and hardware left behind. The poor quality of Russian defenses along a critical north-south axis sustaining the Donetsk offensive is hard to fathom. Once underway, the intent of the Ukrainian offensive was crystal clear -- to destroy that artery of resupply. Within three days, they had done so -- not least because Russian reinforcements were slow to be mobilized. Recriminations begin The Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday sought to portray the abandonment of Kharkiv as a planned redirection of efforts to the Donetsk region -- but it actually complicates those efforts. Until this week, the Russians were able to attack Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk from three directions: north, east and south. The northern axis is now gone: the threat to the industrial belt in and around Sloviansk has much diminished, as has the prospect of Ukrainian defenses being surrounded. Simply put, the battlefield in eastern Ukraine has been redrawn in days. The most influential -- and perhaps surprising -- public critic of the situation was Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has supplied thousands of fighters to the offensive. In a Telegram post Sunday, he said he would be contacting senior officials at the Defense Ministry to spell out his message. ""It's clear that mistakes were made. I think they will draw a few conclusions,"" he said. Hinting at disarray among commanders, Kadyrov said that ""if Russia's General Staff did not want to leave, the (troops) wouldn't back out"" -- but Russian soldiers ""didn't have proper military training"" and that led to them to retreat. Influential military bloggers in Russia have been even more blunt. Zakhar Prilepin, whose Telegram channel has more than 250,000 subscribers, reposted a commentary that described events in Kharkiv as a ""catastrophe"" and a wholesale failure of intelligence. ""Now we can observe the result of the criminal irresponsibility of those who were responsible for this direction,"" the post reads, before concluding: ""The special military operation is long over. There is a war going on."" Another pro-Putin blogger who goes by the name Kholmogorov reposted an equally scathing account by the Partizan Telegram channel from the front lines, which that essentially accused the Russian authorities of abandoning the troops. ""The soldiers were on foot with one machine gun and a sack. Abandoned by the command, not knowing the way, they walked at random,"" the post said. The poster, who describes himself as a Russian Orthodox nationalist, says that while hatred of the enemy grows, ""hatred of the government and command is growing even more."" Adding his own thoughts, Kholmogorov said: ""Lord, save the Russian soldiers from blows from the front and even more from blows in the back."" A similar analysis came from the Telegram channel of Pyotr Lundstrem. ""There are NO thermal imagers, NO bulletproof vests, NO reconnaissance equipment, NO secure communications, NOT enough copters, NO first aid kits in the army."" Referring to commemorations in Russia this weekend for the Day of Moscow, the city's birthday, he added: ""You are celebrating a billionth holiday. What's wrong with you?"" On Saturday, as the rout continued, Putin was inaugurating a ferris wheel in Moscow. The Institute for the Study of War notes the ""withdrawal announcement further alienated the Russian milblogger and Russian nationalist communities that support the Kremlin's grandiose vision for capturing the entirety of Ukraine."" Putin's next move Prominent media figures in Russia are trying to spin this week's calamity as a planned operation. Television host Vladimir Soloviev reposted a Telegram commentary that insisted the ""enemy, buying into an easy advance on a given sector of the front, drives into a trap."" ""Currently, Russian units are purposefully regrouping,"" the commentary added, even though there is little sign of that. That begs the question as to how the Kremlin prosecutes the war after suffering its worst week of the entire campaign. It appears to be short of high-quality units. Some existing battalion tactical groups have been reconstituted; volunteer battalions have been raised across Russia to form a Third Army Corps. US officials say the Russians are running short of munitions, even turning to North Korea for supplies. Stepanenko, at the Institute for the Study of War, told CNN that the remarkable success of the Ukrainian counteroffensive will force a reappraisal of how the new army corps is used. Stepanenko, who studies the recruitment and organization of the Russian military, says the Russians ""might still attempt to use these units to stop the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kharkiv, although rushing ill-trained and unprepared raw units into such operations would be a highly dangerous endeavor."" She believes that given the Russian need for fresh manpower, ""it is likely that the Russian forces are deploying these elements directly onto the front lines in any case based on the reports that some volunteer battalions are already fighting on the Kherson front lines."" The Russian military can still bring considerable power to bear in terms of its rocket, artillery and missile forces. But despite one shuffle of the high command already, its ground operations seem poorly organized, with little autonomy devolved to commanders. The last week has laid bare issues of motivation and leadership. Russian bloggers who have supported the offensive say a radical rethink is required. One commented: ""A change of approach to the war in Ukraine is needed. Mobilization of the economy and industry. Creation of a political control center for war."" Strelkov came to the same conclusion, saying it is time to ""start fighting for real (with martial law, the mobilization of the army and the economy.)"" Throughout the conflict, Putin has avoided a general mobilization, which might be unpopular at home. It's impossible to know whether the Kremlin will now double down in an effort to complete the special military operation or begins to look for a negotiated settlement. The first option looks a tall order given the events of the last week; the second would be humiliating. The third possibility, perhaps the most likely, is that Russia will persist with its grinding inch-by-inch onslaught while taking little to no additional territory. But it now faces an adversary with the wind in its sails and fresh infusions of Western military aid being prepared for the winter months. Ukraine's battlefield advances have rejuvenated allied support, with a meeting in Germany this weekend producing further pledges of long-term support.",7,1.666506050096555,2.83630349707103,-1.1697974469744752,13
2022-09-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/politics/us-military-ukraine-analysis/index.html,US military working on analysis to shape and support Ukraine's military in long term,"The Pentagon is preparing detailed analysis and working out how to support Ukraine's military in the medium and long term, including after the war with Russia has ended, according to three defense officials. The efforts are being led by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and would build on the billions of dollars in military aid the US has given to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February. The process is at an early stage and a senior defense official said it is looking at the ""future of Ukrainian forces,"" aiming to answer key questions about ""what makes sense?"" and ""what do we want Ukraine to start having in the mid and the long term?"" in terms of military support. As well as the current conflict, which is expected to be lengthy, the US is looking, at least, at the next five years after the war is over. ""What are the things that if we wanted to imagine with Ukraine, what their future force would be, let's say if they want to be a maneuver force and they want to have these defensive capabilities as well as offensive capabilities, what seems to make sense?"" the official told CNN. The analysis is being conducted in conjunction with the Ukrainians and if approved by President Joe Biden it could lead to years of future arms sales and the establishment of a long-term military training program by the US. It would be presented to Kyiv as an assessment, but it would provide a clear road map showing how the US believes it should develop its military. The analysis is expected to ""come together in the next month or two,"" the senior defense official said, emphasizing that Ukraine's views will be central to the final effort. ""What's their strategy, what do they want?"" they added. The effort will continuously evolve over the next few months as the battlefield shifts and Ukraine's forces advance. The initial effort could lead to recommendations for weapons and training, depending on the military strategy Ukraine approves. That could ultimately extend US and allied involvement with Ukraine for years to come through long-term, multi-year weapons contracts that could be initially finalized before the end of Biden's first term. 'Defending Ukraine for years to come' Last month when discussing aid to Ukraine, Colin Kahl the Department of Defense undersecretary for policy, noted ""While many of these capabilities are not intended to directly contribute to today's fight, they will form the backbone of a robust future Ukrainian force, capable of defending Ukraine for years to come."" The US assessment and initial plans could be discussed when Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin meet counterparts from allied countries in Germany on Thursday. The analysis and planning follow a recent war game the US and Ukraine conducted in advance of the current counteroffensive into the Kherson region. Some of the lessons learned from that war game are being incorporated, one of the officials said. The analysis will also include initial consideration of Ukraine's needs for a modernized air force of fixed wing and helicopter aircraft to support a highly mobile ground force, officials said. While Ukrainian air forces firing long-range HARM missiles are having some success, the US is looking at helping make Ukraine's ground forces, which have proven successful in the most recent combat operations, more maneuverable. The Pentagon has also established a working group intended to streamline the foreign military sales process, according to two defense officials. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks created the group, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which will help allies and partners including Ukraine with their requests for US military equipment. Ultimately, this effort could streamline the process for Ukraine to purchase advanced American weaponry, as the US and NATO seek to transition Ukraine's military away from Soviet-era equipment to modern Western weapons. Weapons and hardware Ukraine currently has an inventory of roughly 1,000 drones of various capabilities, according to Pentagon officials. The US and Ukrainians are finding that drones with shorter ranges and small amounts of explosives may not be as useful as larger drones, the senior defense official said. Therefore, it's expected a long-awaited contract for 10 Switchblade 600 drones equipped with anti-armor warheads could be issued within a month. After that, decisions could come on what, if any, additional airborne capabilities are needed. One of Ukraine's most enduring needs is for an ongoing supply of 155 mm artillery ammunition. The Ukrainians are using it at a high rate and the US will have to replenish its own stockpiles The Pentagon issued $364 million in contracts late last month to a variety of US and international suppliers. ""This is a big deal,"" said William LaPlante, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, told CNN. ""I can't say the sources, but they are around the world."" The goal is to deliver 100,000 rounds in 90 days and 15,000 a month after that. The longer-term goal is to deliver more than 30,000 rounds a month in the next two to three years. Separately, another defense official said a contract is expected from the Army in the coming days to begin to replenish US 155 mm ammunition stocks due to the high volume being sent to Ukraine. Current US production is about 15,000 rounds a month at facilities in Pennsylvania but additional government funding is aimed at getting production up to more than 30,000 rounds a month. The Pentagon is working with industry across the board to increase production rates for both export to Ukraine and to rebuild US stockpiles of munitions and launch systems. To alleviate the pressure on US supplies, several additional production contracts have been issued since April for surface-to-air missile systems, additional unmanned aerial vehicles, radars and highly precise ground-launched rockets with advanced fuses designed to limit civilian casualties in close combat. To replenish US weapons stocks from the drawdown of inventory sent to Ukraine, the US has issued several critical contracts since May including: $624 million to Raytheon for Stinger missile systems; $352 million to Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for the Javelin anti-armor system; $33 million to Lockheed for HIMARS multiple rocket launcher, and $8 million to AeroVironment for smaller Switchblade drones. The Pentagon also hopes to more than double monthly HIMARS production to 12 launchers per month. The US is also looking at funding modifications to existing systems such as the Boeing Insitu ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle to allow Ukraine to use them to collect vital electronic battlefield intelligence on Russian targets such as radar and electronic communications systems.",49,5.185283103538119,2.366659742731546,2.8186233608065727,8
2022-09-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/politics/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/index.html,"Ukrainian forces aim to retake Kherson by year's end as gains made in South, US and Ukrainian officials say","One week into a new counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces are making gains in the south, with the ambitious goal of taking back most of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson by the end of the year, senior US officials and Ukrainian officials tell CNN. The last week has seen the most ambitious ground assaults by the Ukrainians since the beginning of the invasion, following sustained attacks on command posts, ammunition stores, and fuel reserves far behind the front lines, according to geolocation of video and satellite imagery. The US has observed Ukrainian forces achieve some success in attacking Russian supply lines, with the intention of cutting off and isolating Russian troops currently deployed west of the Dnipro River, according to a senior US official. ""What we've seen in the Kherson region first is some continued offensive operations by the Ukrainians,"" Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters. ""They continue to make some forward movement. We are aware that they have retaken some villages."" Ryder also said that the US has seen ""some offensive Russian activity ... near Bakhmut."" According to Ukrainian officials, the goal is to take at least all territory north or west of the Dnipro River, including not only the city of Kherson but also Nova Kakhovka, site of an important hydroelectric plant as well as the canal that supplies Crimea with much of its water. At the same time, Ukrainian forces have stepped up attacks in Eastern Ukraine in order to prevent Russia from shifting forces to the South to attempt to repel the Ukrainian counteroffensive there, US officials said. In recent days, Ukrainian forces have pushed towards Russian supply lines south of Kharkiv, taking several villages and towns in the process. The current offensive in the south is broad-based -- extending more than 100 miles wide -- to prevent Russian units from concentrating on one point. Additionally, there has been an uptick in sabotage operations and attacks on pro-Russian officials in occupied areas. US officials acknowledge the Ukrainian goal of recapturing Kherson by the end of 2022 is ambitious but remains possible if Ukraine continues to make progress in its current operations. Ukrainian forces are planning for a long and brutal campaign to retake Russian-controlled territory. The current Ukrainian push is expected to extend into the Spring, with some of the attacks now intended to prepare the battlefield for planned advances over the next several months. Ukraine has been publicly signaling for months that it intended to launch a major counteroffensive to retake territory lost to Russia in the six-month war. And even before Ukrainian forces began increasing their artillery rocket and missile fire on the front lines in southern Ukraine, Kyiv had been actively disrupting Russian resupply efforts and command and control across the region. In the buildup to the current Ukrainian counteroffensive, the US urged Kyiv to keep the operation limited in both its objectives and its geography to avoid getting overextended and bogged down on multiple fronts, multiple US and western officials and Ukrainian sources previously told CNN. Those discussions involved engaging in ""war-gaming"" with Kyiv, the sources said -- analytical exercises that were intended to help the Ukrainian forces understand what force levels they would need to muster to be successful in different scenarios. The Ukrainians were initially considering a broader counteroffensive, but narrowed their mission to the south, in the Kherson region, in recent weeks, US and Ukrainian officials previously said.",7,2.2554491614199703,4.711057482748087,-2.455608321328117,13
2022-09-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/politics/russia-rockets-purchase-north-korea-ukraine/index.html,"Russia is purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea, US official says","Russia is in the process of purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, a US official tells CNN. The purchase indicates that the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions, according to the official. The US expects Russia could try to buy more military equipment from North Korea going forward, the official added. The New York Times first reported on the purchase. The two countries had formed relations through the Korean War of the 1950s, with the former Soviet Union having been a major benefactor to North Korea, financially propping the regime up. North Korea has blamed the US and the West for the war in Ukraine. News of Moscow buying weaponry from North Korea follows a recent US assessment that Russia now possesses weapons-capable drones from Iran also likely for use in the war in Ukraine. The US believes that Moscow officially purchased the Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series drones -- the Shahed-129 and Shahed-191 -- from Iran and transferred to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine. The drones are capable of carrying precision guided munitions and can be used for surveillance. Russia has been looking to hamper Ukrainian military's use of recently Western-supplied long-range precision artillery and rocket systems, including the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), on the battlefield. With the HIMARS, Ukraine has been able to precisely target and hit Russian command posts, logistical hubs and ammunition dumps well beyond the front lines. Defense Department press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during a briefing at the Pentagon Tuesday that Russia has approached North Korea to ""request ammunition."" The request from Russia to North Korea is ""indicative of the situation Russia finds itself in,"" Ryder said. ""It does demonstrate and is indicative of the situation Russia finds itself in in terms of logistics and sustainment capabilities as it relates to Ukraine,"" Ryder said. ""We assess that things are not going well on that front for Russia, so the fact that they're reaching out to North Korea is a sign that they're having some challenges on the sustainment front."" A sign Russia may be struggling to maintain supplies for Ukraine war The availability of ammunition will prove to be one of the most critical factors in Russia's ability to sustain its war in Ukraine, US officials told CNN. It has been difficult to assess Russia's levels of ammunition throughout the war, sources said, but its purchase of supplies from North Korea could suggest some Russian stocks are running low. US intelligence officials also believe that the Russians are running short on artillery shells and rockets, amid their scorched-earth tactics of unleashing artillery barrages on Ukrainian cities over the last six months. For now, though, the ammunition deficit does not appear particularly widespread, officials said. But it may be particularly acute for select types of high-caliber multiple launch rocket systems, low caliber artillery systems and precision guided weapons, said Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses. Kofman added that it will take time for Russia to meaningfully ramp up its production to meet the high volume of ammunition expenditure in the war, which the Russian defense industry clearly did not anticipate. In another signal that Moscow may be struggling to maintain the needed resources for its now six-month war, Russia has also been reallocating both manpower and equipment from far-flung military districts in both the east and the north, according to two sources familiar with US and western intelligence. And Russia moved earlier this year to restrict public access to information about its budget, including import and export figures. According to one of these sources, that blackout is a key indicator that Russia has been forced to aggressively redirect funding and other resources towards the conflict -- a fact that it would want to hide from its public. The Kremlin continues to insist that it is not waging a war, but only a limited ""special military operation.""",49,1.734468804416268,3.5485905981406063,-1.8141217937243383,21

Now, Ukrainian prosecutors say they have informed Russia that their pre-trial investigation has zeroed in one of the Russian perpetrators they believe is responsible. The Bucha Prosecutors' Office in the Kyiv region says CNN's exclusive reporting was instrumental in helping identify the Russian soldier. Prosecutors say the suspect is Nikolay Sergeevich Sokovikov, adding that Russia was informed of his charges of ""violation of the laws and customs of war"" and ""intentional murder."" CNN has requested comment from Russia's defense ministry but has not had a response. CNN also asked the Russian MOD for response to our original report in May and never received a reply. Civilians shot in the back In newly obtained footage of the incident obtained by CNN this week, two soldiers can clearly be seen shooting at something next to a business they have just overtaken. Other videos of the incident reveal their target was two unarmed civilians, shot in the back immediately following what appears to be a calm conversation with the soldiers. The incident happened in March outside a vehicle dealership in a village near Kyiv, as Russian forces attempted to take the Ukrainian capital in the early days of the invasion. Sokovikov, along with another unidentified serviceman, inflicted at least 12 gunshot wounds on the civilians, according to Ukrainian prosecutors. They were part of a group of soldiers who then ransacked the business and loaded stolen goods into a car marked ""Tank Special Forces RUS,"" prosecutors said in a statement. CNN previously identified the victims. One was the owner of the looted dealership, whose family does not want to be named. The other was Leonid Oleksiyovych Plyats, a 68-year-old grandfather who worked as a guard there. In addition to the killing, surveillance video shows more unprofessional behavior by the group of five soldiers, who are seen on camera drinking and toasting each other. The group was identified as members of the invading force by their uniforms, analysis of who controlled what area at the time and witness statements. The footage has been verified by CNN. Prosecutors will not reveal exactly how they identified this particular soldier. But CNN has previously reported on one part of the process being used by Ukrainian authorities -- facial recognition technology. Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation uploads images of suspects into software that scrubs social media websites looking for matching photos. Once investigators have a match, they corroborate it with friends and family on the suspects' social media. The identification of this latest suspect for war crimes was months in the making, according to prosecutors. While the pre-trial investigation is ongoing, it is at least one step toward justice for the victims' families.",45,6.542036611648015,7.000470609781043,-0.4584339981330281,3
2022-08-31,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/ukraine-us-wargames-counteroffensive/index.html,US war-gamed with Ukraine ahead of counteroffensive and encouraged more limited mission,"In the buildup to the current Ukrainian counteroffensive, the US urged Kyiv to keep the operation limited in both its objectives and its geography to avoid getting overextended and bogged down on multiple fronts, multiple US and western officials and Ukrainian sources tell CNN. Those discussions involved engaging in ""war-gaming"" with Kyiv, the sources said -- analytical exercises that were intended to help the Ukrainian forces understand what force levels they would need to muster to be successful in different scenarios. The Ukrainians were initially considering a broader counteroffensive, but narrowed their mission to the south, in the Kherson region, in recent weeks, US and Ukrainian officials said. Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told CNN that ""the United States has routine military-to-military dialogue at multiple levels with Ukraine. We will not comment on the specifics of those engagements. Generally speaking, we provide the Ukrainians with information to help them better understand the threats they face and defend their country against Russian aggression. Ultimately, the Ukrainians are making the final decisions for their operations."" Officials say they believe there is now increased parity between the Ukrainian and Russian militaries. But western officials have been hesitant to label the nascent Ukrainian operation -- which appeared to begin on Monday in the southern province of Kherson -- a true ""counteroffensive."" How successful Ukraine is likely to be in regaining lost territory remains an open question, sources familiar with the latest intelligence tell CNN. Ukrainian officials have already said this offensive will likely be a slow operation, and punishingly cold winter weather is coming and then an early spring mud, both of which could force pauses in the fighting. Still, there is a distinct feeling amongst Ukraine's US and western advisers that the Ukrainian military is on much more even footing with Russia than was believed even just a few short months ago, multiple officials told CNN. Russia still maintains superior numbers in overall manpower and massed artillery. But Ukrainian capabilities, bolstered by sophisticated western arms and training, have closed an important gap, officials say -- particularly the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, that Ukraine has been using to launch attacks behind Russian front lines in recent months. ""It shows you what the sustained training and weapons provision can do when the force is highly motivated and capable in its employment,"" a senior NATO official told CNN. Another US military source put it more bluntly: Ukraine has made up for Russia's advantage in sheer volume of fire with its ""competence."" Growing momentum Ukraine has been publicly signaling for months that it intended to launch a major counteroffensive to retake territory lost to Russia in the six-month war. And even before Monday, when Ukrainian forces began increasing their artillery rocket and missile fire on the frontlines in southern Ukraine, Kyiv had been actively disrupting Russian resupply efforts and command and control across the region. For weeks, Ukraine has used a mix of partisan supporters, long-range fire and special operations forces to launch a series of attacks far behind Russian lines -- including in Crimea -- that have targeted logistics and command and control hubs in preparation for the southern offensive. ""I don't think it's possible yet to confirm the extent of Ukrainian advances, but they've certainly impacted Russia's ability to move north and south across [the Dnieper River] with their attacks on bridges,"" the senior NATO official said on Wednesday. ""And in terms of future prospects, I'd note that Ukraine is much closer to parity in troop numbers in Kherson than it has been in recent weeks"" in the eastern provinces of the country, where fighting has ground on for months. Attacks in Crimea have been a particularly smart strategy, one official said, because Russia has been using the peninsula as a launchpad for its operations in southern Ukraine. Russia has also been forced to pull resources from the east ""simply because of reports that the Ukrainians might be going more on the offense in the south,"" John Kirby, the communications coordinator for the National Security Council, said on Monday. ""And so they've had to deplete certain units ...in certain areas in the East in the Donbass, to respond to what they clearly believed was a looming threat of a counter offensive,"" Kirby said. A narrower mission US and Ukrainian sources tell CNN that earlier plans for the Ukrainian operation were initially broader, and involved a more ambitious effort to regain other territory lost to the Russian invasion over the last six months, including the southeastern oblast of Zaporizhzhia. But by Monday, Ukrainian officials appeared laser-focused on retaking the Kherson region. An administration official told CNN that in recent months, Ukraine has been asking the US for weapons specifically suited to their planned southern counteroffensive. The US fulfilled many of those requests -- including additional ammunition, artillery and javelins -- over the course of several presidential drawdown assistance packages provided to Ukraine over the last two months, the official said. The planning exercises also helped the United States better grasp what kind of equipment, munitions or intelligence it could offer that would be most useful to Ukraine. Over the course of the war, the US has been regularly providing Ukraine with military advice and intelligence, along with billions of dollars in equipment and weaponry. 'A slow operation to grind the enemy' Officials say that Ukraine now appears more evenly matched with Russian forces not only because of the advanced western weaponry that Ukraine has been using effectively, but also because the Ukrainians still have the advantage in terms of morale, unit cohesion, tactical acumen, and a superior ability to improvise on the fly. They have another advantage, too, two officials said: a population that is largely appalled by the Russian occupation, and willing to engage in partisan attacks to expel them -- such as assassinations and sabotage efforts behind enemy lines. Still, despite a more bullish assessment of Ukrainian fighting capabilities, US officials aren't placing any bets that Ukraine will successfully retake Kherson -- yet. ""I'm not sure this is going to be the big, massive counteroffensive that folks might be waiting on — it might be a smaller number of forces,"" the US military source cautioned. Much will depend on how well Russia is able to defend newly-claimed territory, the source said—something that it has not yet been called upon to do in the last six months. A Ukrainian presidential adviser also warned that the offensive will be a ""slow operation to grind the enemy."" ""This process will not be very fast,"" Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement posted on his Telegram account late Monday, ""but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine."" CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that the southeastern district of Zaporizhzhia, not the city, was at one point part of a plan to regain territory lost to the Russians.",7,4.278713286385243,3.4689659891090896,0.8097472972761537,13
2022-08-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/politics/russia-iranian-drones/index.html,"US assesses Russia now in possession of Iranian drones, sources say","The US assesses Russia is now in possession of weapons-capable Iranian drones that they will likely deploy on the battlefield in Ukraine, Biden administration officials tell CNN. The Russians picked up the drones from an Iranian airfield earlier this month and transported them back to Russia in cargo planes in mid-August, the officials said. Russian officials began training on the drones in Iran late last month, CNN previously reported, and the US now believes that Russia has officially purchased and transferred the Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series drones -- the Shahed-129 and Shahed-191 -- back to Russia, likely for use in the war in Ukraine. Both types of UAVs, or unmanned aerial vehicles, are capable of carrying precision guided munitions and can be used for surveillance. Russian operators are still training on the drones inside Iran, the officials said, and the US believes that Russia intends to import hundreds of them to use for air-to-surface attacks, electronic warfare and targeting inside Ukraine. The Washington Post first reported that the drones had been transferred to Russia. State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel confirmed on Tuesday that the US assesses Russia has received the drones from Iran, noting that the ""Russian military is suffering from major supply shortages in Ukraine because of sanctions and export controls, forcing Russia to rely on unreliable countries like Iran for supplies and equipment."" ""We'll continue to vigorously enforce all US sanctions on both the Russian and Iranian arms trade and we will stand with our partners throughout the region against the Iranian threat,"" he said. The introduction of the Iranian drones, which can also be used for surveillance, could have a significant impact on the battlefield as Russia looks to blunt the impact of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) that the US and its allies have provided to Ukraine. The HIMARS have a range of 49 miles and have enabled Ukraine to attack targets behind Russian front lines. US intelligence officials believe, however, that when tested, many of the drones Russia has purchased from Iran have already experienced numerous failures, the officials said, so it is unclear how much of a game changer they will be for the Russians when deployed. The Biden administration began warning in July that Russia was looking to purchase the drones amid acute supply shortages stemming from the war in Ukraine and western sanctions that have stymied new production efforts. Satellite imagery revealed that month showed that a Russian delegation had visited an airfield in central Iran at least twice since June to examine weapons-capable drones. The news of the drone transfers comes as the Biden administration has expressed cautious optimism about a possible deal to revive the Iran nuclear deal. The deal's detractors say that a new deal will result in sanctions relief for Iran and, in turn, a financial windfall that could enable Iran's malign activities throughout the region and beyond. White House officials have insisted, however, that the decision to reenter the nuclear deal should be motivated only by the need to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and should not be influenced by Iranian actions that fall outside the scope of their nuclear program.",49,5.989628833736882,4.818116743075068,1.171512090661814,11
2022-08-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/politics/ukraine-shaping-counteroffensive/index.html,"Ukrainian forces begin 'shaping' battlefield for counteroffensive, senior US officials say","Ukrainian forces have begun ""shaping"" operations in southern Ukraine to prepare the battlefield for a significant Ukrainian counteroffensive, two senior US officials briefed on the intelligence told CNN. Shaping operations are standard military practice prior to an offensive and involve striking weapons systems, command and control, ammunition depots and other targets to prepare the battlefield for planned advances. The US believes the Ukrainian counteroffensive, which has long been anticipated, will include a combination of air and ground operations. Ukraine indicated Monday morning that the actions were underway. ""Yes, (Ukrainian forces) have started the offensive actions in several directions on the South front towards liberating the occupied territories,"" Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Operational Command South, told CNN, adding, ""All the details will be available after the operation is fulfilled."" The plans come as Russia's war in Ukraine has passed its six-month mark, with US assessments indicating that Russia has been able to deploy fewer units to the frontlines than initially thought, according to a senior US official. The official said many of the existing units -- which Russia organizes into Battlefield Tactical Groups, or BTGs, comprising infantry, tanks, artillery and air defense -- are deploying below strength, some even at half their normal manpower. The US has also been observing Ukrainian forces benefiting from the use of US- and NATO-supplied HIMARS mobile rocket launchers, which have allowed Ukraine to strike and destroy targets in Russian-held territory. CNN reported last week that US and European officials say Ukraine has successfully used a method of resistance warfare developed by US special operations forces to fight back against Russia and bog down its vastly superior military. The Resistance Operating Concept was developed in 2013 following Russia's war with Georgia a few years earlier but its value was only realized after Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. It provides a blueprint for smaller nations to effectively resist and confront a larger neighbor that has invaded. Neither Ukrainian nor US officials are revealing the main targets of the expected counteroffensive. In recent weeks Ukrainian forces have been making advances around the key southern city of Kherson, which is currently occupied by Russian forces. Kherson is considered crucial to the control of Ukraine's southern coast and access to the Black Sea. Ukrainian and Russian forces have also been engaged in intense fighting in recent days around the nuclear power plant -- Europe's largest -- in the city of Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine's nuclear operator Energoatom said Friday that the plant had been reconnected to Ukraine's electricity grid a day after the plant went offline for the first time in its history.",7,4.388850156245127,3.513739007211341,0.8751111490337857,13
2022-08-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/27/politics/russia-ukraine-resistance-warfare/index.html,How Ukraine is using resistance warfare developed by the US to fight back against Russia,"As the war in Ukraine has passed the six-month mark, US and European officials say Ukraine has successfully used a method of resistance warfare developed by US special operations forces to fight back against Russia and bog down its vastly superior military. The Resistance Operating Concept was developed in 2013 following Russia's war with Georgia a few years earlier but its value was only realized after Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. It provides a blueprint for smaller nations to effectively resist and confront a larger neighbor that has invaded. Russia's nearly bloodless takeover and annexation of the occupied territory stunned Ukraine and the west, intensifying a study of how to build a plan for total defense that included not only the military, but also the civilian population. But Putin's wider war on Ukraine launched in February has been its proving ground. The doctrine, also known as the ROC, provides an innovative and unconventional approach to warfare and total defense that has guided not just Ukraine's military, but also involved the country's civilian population as part of a concerted resistance against Russia's army. ""It's all hands on deck in terms of the comprehensive defense for the government of Ukraine,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Schwartz, who was commander of Special Operations Command Europe during the doctrine's development. ""They're using every resource and they're also using some highly unconventional means by which to disrupt the Russian federation military."" Planning a national resistance Outnumbered, outgunned, and outmanned, Ukraine has nevertheless fought back against a Russian military that thought it would romp through the vast majority of the country within a matter of weeks, if not days. ""This is a way to turn the tables on a first world power,"" said Schwartz. ""It's just incredible to watch that despite the unbelievable loss of life and sacrifice, what the will to resist and the resolve to resist can do."" In a series of recent attacks and explosions at Russian positions in Crimea, Kevin D. Stringer, a retired Army Colonel who led the development team for the resistance concept, sees signs of its use. ""Since you can't do it conventionally, you would use special operations forces, and those [forces] would need resistance support -- intelligence, resources, logistics -- in order to access these regions."" A Ukrainian government report shared with CNN acknowledged Ukraine was behind the attacks on Russian bases and an ammunition depot. The attacks, far behind enemy lines, were beyond the range of the weapons the US and others have publicly sent to Ukraine, and videos of the explosions did not appear to show any incoming missile or drone. Russia blamed sabotage or detonating ammunition for the explosions. ""High probability would say it's very plausible that [the ROC] principles are playing out in actual warfare right now,"" Stringer said. In early-April, Gen. Richard Clarke, the commander of US Special Operations Command, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that the US had helped train resistance companies in Ukraine embedded with special forces over the past 18 months. When asked if he was seeing some of the success of that training in the current conflict, Clarke was direct in his answer. ""Yes, Senator, we are."" Resistance in Ukraine Early in the conflict, the Ukrainian government created a website that explains different ways to resist. The site describes ways of using of nonviolent actions, including boycotting public events, labor strikes, and even how to use humor and satire. The goal is to disrupt the ability of pro-Russian authorities to govern while reminding the population of Ukraine's rightful sovereignty. The resistance doctrine suggests violent actions as well, including using Molotov cocktails, deliberately starting fires and putting chemicals in gas tanks to sabotage enemy vehicles. The doctrine also calls for a broad messaging campaign to control the narrative of the conflict, prevent an occupier's message from taking hold, and keeping the population united. Videos of Ukrainian strikes against Russian tanks, often to a soundtrack of pop music or heavy metal, have gone viral, as have clips of Ukrainian soldiers rescuing stray animals. Whether intentional or not, it becomes part of the resistance, allowing Ukraine to frame the headlines in western media in their favor and often humanizing Ukrainian service members in ways the Russian military has abjectly failed to do. At the forefront of the resistance is Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, who has not let the conflict fade out of sight with nightly speeches and frequent international appearances. His visits near the front-lines make news around the world, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is rarely seen outside the Kremlin or the resort of Sochi. The ongoing messaging barrage has spurred a groundswell of overseas support and successfully increased on western governments to supply more arms and ammunition to Ukraine. Resilience and Resistance Overall, the resistance concept provides a framework for increasing a country's resilience, which is its ability to withstand external pressures, and planning for resistance, defined as a whole-of-country effort to re-establish sovereignty in occupied territories. ""Resilience is society's strength in peacetime that becomes resistance in wartime against the aggressor,"" explained Dalia Bankauskaite, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis who has studied resistance planning in Lithuania. Instead of providing each country the same set of plans, the doctrine is designed to be tailored to each country's population, abilities, and terrain. It is not intended to create or support an insurgency; its goal is to establish a government-sanctioned force that will carry out activities against a foreign occupier with the goal of restoring sovereignty. At first, only Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland expressed real enthusiasm about the new doctrine. But after Russia's nearly bloodless takeover and annexation of Crimea stunned Ukraine and the west in 2014, interest in the resistance method rapidly grew. Since its inception, at least 15 countries have taken part in some form of training on this resistance doctrine, according to Nicole Kirschmann, a spokeswoman for Special Operations Command Europe, where this was developed. In mid-November, as the Biden administration was sounding the first public warnings about the potential for a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Hungary hosted a conference about the Resistance Operating Concept. The commander of Ukraine's Special Operations Forces was at the conference, Kirschmann told CNN, as well as nearly a dozen other countries. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has only increased interest in the concept. ""Baltic states, in particular, are actively talking in their parliaments about implementation of ROC at a national level,"" according to a US official. Resistance in the Baltics In May, nearly three months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania's parliament adopted a new strategy for civil resistance that is much broader than strictly resistance against occupation. Martynas Bendikas, a spokesman for the country's Ministry of National Defence, said that preparing for resistance includes developing the will to defend the country, improving citizens' military and non-military knowledge and skills, and more as part of a national defense. The existence of the resistance doctrine and parts of the planning around resistance is intentionally public, explained Stringer, intended to act as a deterrent against a potential attack, one more aimed at Russia's favored hybrid warfare instead of traditional military and nuclear deterrence. But the details of the plans and the organization within a country are tightly held. For Estonia, a country with a population of about 1.3 million people bordering northwest Russia, civil resistance has always been a part of the defense plan. ""There's no other option for every Estonian,"" said Rene Toomse, a spokesman for the volunteer Estonian Defense League. ""Either you fight for independence if someone attacks you - if Russia attacks you - or you just die."" Estonia regularly updates and develops its defense plans, integrating its standing military with its general population and its volunteer forces, which Toomse said have seen a surge in applications since the beginning of Russia's invasion. Estonian officials have studied the war in Ukraine to learn lessons about what has worked well against Russia, and where Ukraine's resistance could improve. Toomse says Estonians remember Soviet rule well, and those too young to remember are taught in school. Ukraine has excelled at winning the information campaign, Toomse points out, using media posts across multiple platforms, a president who has become a vocal international figure, and a steady stream of information about how well Ukraine's forces are fighting, ""even if they're not emphasizing their own losses."" But Toomse insists Estonia, if it faced invasion, would be more active in any occupied territory, using small, well-armed and well-trained units. ""I imagine that we can do much more damage behind enemy lines than Ukraine has done,"" Toomse said. ""All the logistics, all the convoys, are going to be constantly under attack.""",7,4.183662393454567,3.481334033234292,0.7023283602202746,18
2022-08-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/26/politics/us-navy-hypersonic/index.html,US Navy is developing directed energy systems to counter hypersonic missile threats from China and Russia,"The US Navy is developing directed energy systems as a potential defense against hypersonic missiles, the Navy's top admiral said, calling advances Russia and China have made in hypersonic weapon technology ""a significant concern."" Adm. Michael Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations, on Thursday said developing systems which would use high energy lasers or high power microwaves to destroy a threat is a top priority for the Navy. ""From a defensive standpoint, we're focused on the threat,"" Gilday said Thursday during an event at the Heritage Foundation. ""We're not ignoring it."" Hypersonic missiles, which travel at five times the speed of sound or faster, pose a unique challenge to US defensive systems. They fly far faster than traditional missiles, and they don't fly like ballistic missiles on predictable trajectories, making them much more difficult to detect and intercept. Gilday noted the advances adversaries like Russia and China have made in hypersonic weapons. ""They're a significant concern,"" Gilday said. ""Russia and China are both developing those capabilities and will be fielding those capabilities shortly."" Russia has used its hypersonic Kinzhal missile in the war in Ukraine, while China tested a hypersonic glide vehicle last year. Directed energy systems, which use lasers or microwave emitters to destroy a system or disrupt its electronics, are a potential option for defending against hypersonic weapons. This month, the Navy installed Lockheed Martin's HELIOS laser system on the USS Preble. HELIOS, which stands for High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance, is the latest system in the Navy's efforts to field more powerful and capable defensive laser weapons. Heidi Shyu, the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, has named directed energy systems as a technology area of critical importance to the Defense Department. For years, directed energy systems that use lasers or microwave emitters to destroy targets were the stuff of science fiction, but the technology has finally matured to the point where it can be fielded by the military, Shyu said earlier this year. In 2014, the Navy successfully tested and deployed a laser weapon system on the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf. The system was capable of engaging drones, small aircraft and small boats. Last year, the Navy tested a more advanced laser system on the USS Portland. The US is still in the process of testing different hypersonic systems, some of which have been delayed by a series of testing failures. The Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, suffered three straight failures in testing before its most recent success in April. In July, a test of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body failed after an ""anomaly"" occurred during the first test of the full system, the Pentagon said. The previous test of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, a joint venture between the Navy and Army, also ended prematurely when the booster rocket failed. Without the booster rocket, the Pentagon could not proceed with a test of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body. But Gilday said Thursday the services were still committed to the success of the program. The Army will be the first to field the missile next year, while the Navy plans to put the missile on destroyers in 2025 and fast attack submarines in 2028.",49,6.183012633795467,8.293400482612181,-2.110387848816714,12

The ​researchers say these ​sites are used by Russian forces ​and their allies to process, register, interrogate and detain Ukrainians trying to ​leave Russian-occupied territory. ​Those detained can include civilians and prisoners of war. ​The Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab (Yale HRL) in collaboration with US State Department-supported Conflict Observatory used open-source information and high-resolution satellite imagery to map them. ​ According to the report, there is evidence suggesting they were set up even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine began and grew following the capture of Mariupol in April. ""The conditions reported by those released from the facilities examined here can constitute cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment under international humanitarian and human rights law,"" the study says, adding that the ""conditions include overcrowded facilities, a lack of access to adequate sanitation, insufficient food and clean water, exposure to the elements, denial of medical care, and the use of isolation."" ""In some specific instances, the treatment described as having been endured by those released, such as use of electric shocks, extreme conditions of isolation, and physical assault, may potentially constitute torture if proven,"" the study says. ​In a separate press release Thursday, the US State Department described the ""unlawful transfer and deportation of protected persons"" described in the study as ""a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and constitutes a war crime."" Volnovakha Correctional Colony is one of the ​​sites described in the study. Detailed ​findings allege it is a long-term facility for those who didn't pass filtration ​along with prisoners of war who surrendered after the Azovstal steel plant siege. The study notes the accounts of apparent survivors who described among other things: overcrowded cells, forced labor and even torture. Yale HRL says it identified two areas of disturbed earth along the south and southwest sections of that facility which appear to be mass graves. ​ An account cited in the report ​from someone described as a ""survivor"" also claimed a cellmate had been working a shift digging graves inside the colony. In July there was a deadly explosion there ​in which Ukrainian separatists say 53 POWs were killed, but the satellite images ​used for the report predate this. The Yale study notes that ""without further investigation, including the ability to independently excavate these locations, no definitive determination can be made about what these sites may contain based only on the evidence ​in this report."" Threats and humiliation Earlier this year CNN spoke to a number of Ukrainians who went through ""filtration"" and described facing threats and humiliation during the process. They say they were asked about their politics, future plans and views on the war. ​Some ​of the people ​who spoke to CNN said they knew of others who had been picked up by Russian troops or separatist soldiers and disappeared without a trace. The Kremlin has denied using so-called filtration camps to cover up wrongdoing and targeting civilians in Mariupol. ​ In the Yale study, the Russian Embassy in Washington said the system ""is about checkpoints for civilians leaving the active combat zone. In order to avoid sabotage operations by the Ukrainian nationalists' battalions, Russian soldiers carefully inspect vehicles heading to safe regions."" It adds that it will ""detain bandits and fascists"" and that the Russian military does not create barriers for civilians but helps them by providing food and medicine. In CNN reporting from July, Dmitry Vaschenko, an official with Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations in Taganrog, said housing would be given to Ukrainians, who were also free to seek work and send their children to school. ""When hostilities end in the future, all these arrivals can make the decision to return to their homeland. Whoever wishes to remain in Russia, the Russian government takes such an obligation -- they will receive a full range of social services and are protected,"" he said. When asked about the process to allow refugees into Russia, he said there were ""filtration points"" on the border. ""They are checking people who appear aggressively disposed towards the Russian Federation,"" he said. ""Filtering occurs precisely upon arrival, there are no 'mass camps.' They are border-crossing points, nothing more."" The self-declared DPR has denied accusations by Ukrainian authorities of unlawful detentions, filtration and maltreatment of Ukrainian citizens and said that those arriving at what it calls ​""reception centers​"" are properly fed and provided medical attention. ""The Donetsk oblast filtration system run by Russia and their proxies represents an urgent human rights emergency,"" Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of Yale HRL said in the ​press release from the Yale School of Public Health. ""International monitors need unfettered access to these facilities today. Every day that passes without independent monitors being present in these locations increases the risk that grave human rights abuses may be occurring with impunity."" According to the study​'s methodology, ""each source was evaluated using criteria established by the Berkeley Protocol on Digital Open Source Investigations."" It added that data points ""were cross-referenced against recent very high-resolution satellite imagery. Five independent sources had to corroborate a site's location and the filtration activities alleged to occur there for the site to be included in the report.

However, the council, which provides guidance and recommendations to the DHS secretary, noted that the ""underlying work of Department components on this issue is critical."" ""DHS must be able to address the disinformation threat streams that can undermine the security of our homeland,"" the advisory report said. Espinosa said the department will use the council's recommendations as a guide to ""continue to address threat streams that undermine the security of our country consistent with the law, while upholding the privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of the American people and promoting transparency in our work."" Nina Jankowicz, the disinformation expert with experience working on Ukraine and Russia issues, resigned in May after the department paused the board. Her appointment had quickly drawn condemnation from GOP lawmakers and right-wing media, who pointed to her past tweets and statements regarding Hunter Biden's laptop and Christopher Steele, the author of the so-called Steele Dossier. At the time, Jankowicz told CNN that she resigned because the board's future was uncertain. ""I had hoped we would be more transparent about how the board was going to operate and what it was going to do,"" she said, acknowledging that the new initiative should have been rolled out differently. ""For whatever reason, that didn't happen, and that information vacuum only grew. And I think the information vacuum kind of directed a lot of the attacks and digging around in my personal life."" DHS and the White House previously defended the board but eventually decided to pause the initiative and call for a review. Mayorkas asked former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff and former US Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick to lead the review of the board through the advisory council.",20,6.685199959021476,4.989815735462937,1.6953842235585395,28
2022-08-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/election-security-midterms-cyber-command/index.html,"US 'actively defending against foreign interference and influence' in midterms, Cyber Command says","US military and intelligence officials are stepping up their efforts to defend the electoral process from foreign hacking and disinformation as the November midterms approach, officials said Thursday. Officials are ""actively defending against foreign interference and influence operations in U.S. elections,"" US Cyber Command and the National Security Agency said in a statement, ""specifically by focusing on how adversaries seek to undermine U.S. interests and prosperity, the will to vote of the populace, as well as their belief in the sanctity and security of their elections."" US intelligence officials are warning that Russia, China and Iran may seek to interfere in the US voting process or shape voters' perceptions, according to the command. Asked last month whether the war in Ukraine may distract Russia from interfering in the US midterm elections, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was ""quite confident the Russians can walk and chew gum"" and that US officials were preparing accordingly. US officials also ""have to be concerned about hybrid threats,"" Wray said at a cybersecurity conference at Fordham University in New York. That includes a situation in which foreign operatives might use an ""unremarkable cyber incident"" to sow ""panic or lack of confidence in our election infrastructure,"" Wray said. In a separate intelligence bulletin sent to state and local officials this week, the Department of Homeland Security said Russia will likely continue to use its hacking and information operation capabilities to undercut trust in US public institutions and sow discord in the US. The DHS analysis, obtained by CNN, focuses on Russia's broader cyber activity against various sectors and not specifically on elections. ""Moscow will continue to seek new methods of circumventing US social media companies' anti-disinformation activities to further expand its narratives globally,"" the memo says. Facing a rise in violent threats, election officials are under intense pressure as the midterm vote approaches. In addition to any foreign interference, election officials will have to contend with extensive mis- and disinformation about election integrity spread by Americans, many who falsely claim that President Joe Biden was not legitimately elected. Cyber Command is the US military's offensive and defense cyber unit that has since 2018 increasingly focused on protecting elections from foreign meddling. The command and the NSA, the US signals intelligence agency, again formed an election-security focused team to be on the hunt for foreign threats, as they did in 2020. The Cyber Command-NSA Election Security Group ""continues to increase information-sharing of cyber threats and insights with industry and interagency counterparts,"" Maj. Katrina Cheesman, a spokesperson for the group, told CNN. ""We are complementing efforts of industry through identifying and attributing foreign malicious behavior,""' and sharing insights on the activity with non-government partners, Cheesman added. Cyber Command did not go into detail in its statement Thursday on recent operations it has conducted to defend US elections, but its past work has included knocking offline a Russian troll farm spouting disinformation during the 2018 election. US military and intelligence officials have gotten more involved, along with the Department of Homeland Security, in trying to thwart foreign hacking and influence operations following the 2016 presidential election. That year, Russian military intelligence operatives hacked and leaked emails belonging to the Democratic party in an effort to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, according to US intelligence reports. Federal and state and local officials now regularly drill for hacking and information operations that could interfere with the vote. Last week, officials from across the country held one such drill involving an array of hypothetical threats to election operations. ""The nation's election officials face a range of challenges, including cyber and physical risks to their infrastructure, and false election information that weaken voters' trust in the process,"" US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly and other federal and state officials said in a joint statement after the exercise.",20,5.294522244580207,4.170991588917152,1.123530655663055,14
2022-08-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/us-israel-cyberattacks-sharing-agreement/index.html,US and Israeli agencies use new agreement to defend against cyberattacks,"The US and Israeli governments have shared key details of unrelated cyberattacks on their infrastructure -- one from suspected pro-Russia hackers and the other from possible Iranian hackers -- as part of heightened efforts in recent months to bolster cyber defense between the two allies, a senior US Treasury official told CNN. The exchange of the intelligence, enabled by a finalized agreement the Treasury Department will announce Thursday, underscores the value both governments place in tapping data gathered by their private sectors to guard against an array of hacking threats from governments and cybercriminals alike. It also shows that, despite the revelation in February that Israeli-made spyware had allegedly been used against US diplomats, Jerusalem and Washington are still in lockstep on some cyber-related issues. One of the hacking incidents, which hasn't been previously reported, involved hackers unsuccessfully trying to overwhelm the US Treasury Department's computer servers and knock them offline in February and March, around the time that Russia waged war in Ukraine and the US slapped sanctions on the Kremlin, according to Todd Conklin, deputy assistant Treasury for cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection. The malicious cyber activity -- known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack -- did not impact Treasury operations, Conklin said, but it was significant enough that US officials passed detailed information on it to their Israeli counterparts so they could check their systems for the threat. Officials did not pinpoint the culprit but Conklin said he suspected hackers sympathetic to Russia may have been responsible. In a separate incident, the Israeli government in March was hit by a DDoS attack that temporarily knocked some government websites offline, a hack that some Israeli press reports suggested originated in Iran. The Israelis shared technical information on the attack with the US Treasury, Conklin said, which passed it along to American financial firms that are no stranger to Iranian attempts to disrupt their systems. Both of the hacking incidents are examples of how the new agreement to rapidly trade threat data is supposed to work in practice, according to Conklin. There are other means for the two governments to share cyberthreat data, including between defense and homeland security agencies. But the new agreement means officials in the Israeli finance ministry and the US Treasury will have a formal means -- rather than an ad hoc arrangement that relies on personal relationships -- of rapidly sharing hacking threats to their respective financial sectors. The agreement could also lead to more cyberattack drills involving big US financial firms and their Israeli counterparts, Conklin said. ""Israel has a really strong public-private partnership in this space,"" Conklin told CNN. ""So they have access to a lot more real-time vulnerability data impacting ... not only government systems, but also their broader private sector."" The US and Israel have a long and complicated history of collaborating in cyberspace that has been at times strengthened -- and tested -- by their shared foe in Iran. US and Israeli operatives were reportedly behind a 2009 and 2010 operation to hack sensitive computer systems and destroy uranium-enrichment centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear facility. The US is currently seeking to revive the 2015 agreement with Iran to set limits on Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Iranian hacking operations sometimes ebb and flow in response to geopolitical events, according to analysts. There have been no public reports of a shift in Iranian cyber activity around the latest nuclear-deal negotiations. The new agreement with Israel, however, ""would offer an opportunity as a first-alert-type mechanism for us"" if there was any new Iranian hacking activity aimed at the US or Israel, Conklin said.",20,4.226253634955991,6.285945276619549,-2.0596916416635587,2

Wednesday's anniversary -- which commemorates 31 years since Ukraine broke its ties with the Soviet Union -- also marks six months since Russia's unprovoked invasion of the country. ""The US Embassy urges US citizens to depart Ukraine now using privately available ground transportation options if it is safe to do so,"" a security alert on the embassy's website said. ""The security situation throughout Ukraine is highly volatile and conditions may deteriorate without warning."" The renewed US alert comes follows similar warnings from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other officials that Moscow may carry out intense attacks, including missile strikes, around August 24. ""We must all be aware that this week Russia could try to do something particularly ugly, something particularly vicious,"" Zelensky said in a video message at the weekend. Ukraine's government warned citizens to be ""especially careful"" on Tuesday and Wednesday. ""There is an increased threat of missile attacks and other provocations -- both inside the country and outside,"" said Andrii Yusov, a spokesperson for the Defense Intelligence service of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. ""They are crazy about dates and symbols, so it would be quite logical to be on guard and be prepared for the fact that Independence Day will also be attacked. Ukraine is ready for this,"" he continued. ""The air raid alarm is a serious signal, that everyone should take into account. Especially on August 23 and 24 -- these are not just words, you have to be especially careful,"" Yusov added. In Kyiv, the city military administration issued a ban on all big gatherings between Monday and Thursday, saying ""it is forbidden to hold mass events, peaceful meetings, rallies and other events related to a large gathering of people."" Gen. Mykola Zhyrnov, head of Kyiv's military administration, said the order was imposed so that security forces could respond in a ""timely manner to threats of missile and bomb attacks by the troops of the Russian Federation on decision-making centers, military facilities, defense industry facilities, critical infrastructure and nearby residential areas."" Last week, the State Department said it summoned Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov to a meeting so the United States ""could warn Russia against any escalation of its war on Ukraine,"" a department spokesperson said Monday. This included calling on Russia to ""cease all military operations at or near Ukraine's nuclear facilities and to return full control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant to Ukraine,"" the official added. The town of Nikopol across the river from the occupied plant suffered shelling on Ukraine's Day of the National Flag on Tuesday, a local official said. Yevhen Yevtushenko, the head of Nikopol district military administration, warned locals to avoid mass gatherings, open areas and infrastructure facilities through Thursday. Kyiv and Moscow have made a barrage of accusations against each other about security and military action at and around the plant, the largest nuclear complex in Europe. But the lack of independent access to the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March, makes it impossible to verify what is happening there. Recent satellite images from Maxar Technologies of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant show no signs of ""systemic shelling,"" despite claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin that the Ukrainian military was conducting repeated military strikes at the facility. Tensions in the war spiked this week with the death of Darya Dugina, a Russian political commentator and the daughter of prominent ultranationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin. Russia has blamed Ukrainian special services for her killing, according to Russian state news agency TASS. ""The murder of journalist Darya Dugina has been solved, it was prepared by the Ukrainian special services, by a citizen of Ukraine,"" TASS reported, citing Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), which named a woman as the perpetrator and said she had fled to Estonia after the attack. Ukraine has denied any involvement in Dugina's killing, calling the FSB claims fiction. Dugina, the editor of a Russian disinformation website, died after a bomb planted in a car she was driving went off on the outskirts of Moscow on Saturday evening. Dugina's father, Alexander Dugin, is a prominent Russian nationalist credited with being the architect or ""spiritual guide"" of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.",20,5.966238686087451,4.725599635467647,1.2406390506198033,25

Two weeks ago, Pavel Filatyev spoke out against the conflict in a 141-page-long testimony posted to his VKontakte social media page, then fled Russia. He is the first serving member of the Russian military to publicly criticize the invasion of Ukraine and leave the country. Now he tells CNN that his fellow troops as tired, hungry and disillusioned -- and that the Kremlin's war effort is ""destroying peaceful lives."" ""We understood that we were dragged into a serious conflict where we are simply destroying towns and not actually liberating anyone,"" Filatyev told CNN's Matthew Chance. CNN is not disclosing the location of the interview for the security of the interviewee. ""Many understood that we do not see the reason that our government is trying to explain to us. That all of it is a lie,"" he said. ""We are just destroying peaceful lives. This fact immensely influenced our morale. That feeling that we are not doing anything good."" Filatyev, 33, told CNN ""corruption"" and repression are rife in his home country and said his unit -- which was based in Crimea and sent to Ukraine entering Kherson early in the conflict -- was ill-equipped and given little explanation for Russia's invasion. According to Filatyev, the soldiers and their commanders did not know what they were expected to do in Ukraine. He added that they soon became disillusioned with the government's reasoning for its invasion after arriving in Kherson and facing resistance from locals who did not want to be ""liberated."" The paratrooper served in Russia's 56th air assault regiment and was also involved in efforts to capture the city of Mykolaiv. He was evacuated from the front lines because of an injury. He told CNN the Russian army lacked basic equipment, as well as drones and other types of unmanned aircraft during his stint on the front line. ""Our barracks are about 100 years old and are not able to host all of our servicemen ... all of our weapons are from the times of Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Several days after we encircled Kherson many of us did not have any food, water or sleeping sacks on them,"" he said. ""Because it was very cold at night, we couldn't even sleep. We would find some rubbish, some rags, just to wrap ourselves to keep warm."" The capture of Kherson was a significant early military success for Russia. Ukraine is now battling to regain the city as fighting increasingly shifts to the country's south. But Filatyev said he struggles to understand the vision of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion of Ukraine nearly six months ago and has seen his troops locked in a grinding, costly conflict. ""Now that I am out of there and without a gun, I think this is the worst, stupidest thing our government could have done,"" he said. ""I do not know where the government is leading us. What is the next step? Nuclear war?"" ""I see what is happening to my country and I am terrified. Everything is destroyed, corrupted,"" he told CNN. ""The only laws that function well are repressive ones."" Filatyev fled Russia after conducting some initial media interviews. But he suggested the Kremlin could take revenge for his public position. ""I will either be put in prison ... or they will just silence me by taking me out. There were a lot of cases like that in the past,"" he said. ""I do not see any other way out. If it happens, it happens.""",7,4.494063750512243,3.4475660354956785,1.0464977150165646,18
2022-08-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/14/europe/ukraine-frontline-analysis-robertson-intl-cmd/index.html,A three-week drive around Ukraine's front lines taught me this: The tide of the war is unlikely to turn any time soon,"There are many observations to be made about Ukraine. But on a recent road trip, one sticks out -- just how vast the country is. Three weeks of driving from south to east in this sprawling country through front line villages, towns, past trenches and along hedgerows which are this wars strategic equivalent of high ground, is an education, and one that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use. Almost six months on, the disastrous war that he launched is stagnating. Scenes reminiscent of World War I trench warfare and its associated incremental gains and death are taking hold. The almost 1,000-mile-long battle front Putin opened has hardened, but the country behind is deep, and for the most part unscathed. Thirty miles from the front, city lawns are still being mowed, while many hundreds of miles away in the capital Kyiv, fancy restaurants have reopened, where fine wines and chilled champagnes are available, and fresh caught Mediterranean fish is on the menu. This is a fat land, with fertile farms and proud crops rich from rain and sun. If strategic depth is what's behind the front lines, Ukraine has an untapped wealth available. Perhaps most striking is the number of military age males across the country who are not yet committed to the fight. Ukraine is at war, but not yet it seems, all in. Only some of Ukraine's potential fighting force are in bunkers buried in tree lines overlooking Russian forces. Cobblers, authors, artists, teachers, businessmen, journalists, even a former McDonalds franchise CEO, are holding back Putin's push, but when the government needs it there are many more who can be called on. The big takeaway is, that this is not a war that's going to be over fast, not is even clear yet if the real defining fight has begun. Reality on the ground No front line position can really be measured day-by-day, but over weeks of travel and many many conversations, a reality emerges. The war is settling into a slower phase where the contours of what's contested are becoming clear, but the detail on any given day shifts. Tree lines that border the huge fields here are favored by both sides to stay hidden from drones and the strikes that follow once spotted, but the massive fields often dictate front lines a mile apart. The result less likelihood of positions shifting. Troops on some fronts in the east told CNN they'd seen as many as half of Russia's troops pulled out of the fight, yet just a handful of miles away amid a cacophony of artillery, grad rockets, anti-aircraft gunfire, heavy machine guns and small arms, Russia seems all in. And along lines in the south, Ukrainian troops told us they'd seen Russians bulking up, pushing more forces in. Ukrainian officials say they're expecting a Russian advance and have built up a counter-narrative they'll retake Kherson, one of the first cities to fall in early March, as Russia ramps up strikes on Mykolaiv. Logically Kherson is the obvious first big grab, most Russian forces are on the other side of the Dniper river making it a vulnerable bridgehead valued by both sides. But the reality on the ground is that we saw no buildup of Ukrainian forces. In fact, quite the opposite: huge expanses near the front were devoid of soldiers. They weren't hiding in the trees either; roads seemed virtually untouched by heavy-tracked fighting vehicles or tanks, with no tell-tale mud on the road or any sign troops were moving in numbers. Russia lied its way in to this war, lied to the world it wouldn't invade, and lied to itself an easy victory awaited. It may now also be victim of a carefully curated lie, or information operation sowing false information about Ukrainian intentions. Hype about a Ukraine's southern offensive maybe nothing more than that, a trick causing Russia to redeploy forces from the east to the south. What hasn't changed, despite the influx of Western weapon systems like the US HIMARS, and M777, British MLRS and Polish KRABS, Russia still outmans and outguns Ukraine by about five to one. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky says there won't be peace until Russia leaves all occupied territory including Crimea, which they annexed in 2014. He'll need an army to do it, but not the hodge-podge of regulars and volunteers that he has at his disposal today. Today cellphones often substitute for secure radios, flip flops for combat boots, friendships for formal command structures. One volunteer drone commander said he calls his artillery buddy on an unencrypted mobile phone, not a secure radio or data channel, when he spots a good target. In a more joined-up military structure the artillery commander would see the drone feed live. Ukraine's army won't give up an inch without a fight, but while its volunteer army has impressed the world and surprised the invading forces with their determination and resilience, reclaiming lost territory would cost less blood with a more integrated and professional force. Time and again along the front line troops told us when they lay down fire on Russian forces the enemy's guns go silent. Western help is buying respite but not a lasting reprieve from the threat. Soldiers' pale faces and distant stares told us just how much time they spend sheltering in spade-dug, damp, claustrophobic holes wondering if the next incoming rocket will be their last. Unless you've experienced this bombardment, it's easy to understate how harrowing the constant danger is -- for both soldiers and civilians. It eats into sleep, stretches time, collapses concentration. Senses shut down, many impervious to the detonations, only diving for cover when an explosion is particularly close. That's the life we found in many towns and villages in the wide ribbons of contested territory, the closer to the front the greater the danger. Like scenes from WW1, citizens scavenge wood from bombed wreckage of neighbors' houses, they cook outside because they have no gas, electricity or water. Imagine a winter like this? Soon, we won't have to, the cold months are coming, hardships and deprivations will multiply. Local hospitals are clearing wards ready to treat more victims. Russia is increasingly targeting civilians with illegal cluster bombs, significantly driving up the number of causalities and spreading terror. One victim told us he was sitting outside his home with friends when a cluster bomb struck, injuring three of them and breaking his leg, damaging his arm and peppering his body with tiny metal fragments. An ugly world war throwback is wrapping a wreath around a ribbon of Ukraine. Putin's hell has a lot more ugly tomorrows to come, and while the tide of Putin's offensive has yet to turn conclusively for Ukraine, it is weakening in their favor.",7,2.5671959559733586,4.636764245298166,-2.0695682893248075,18

""During the last several weeks, Russian officials conducted training in Iran as part of the agreement for UAV transfers from Iran to Russia,"" a US official told CNN. The official said the intelligence about the training has recently been declassified. CNN has reached out to the Russian embassy in Washington for comment. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said last month that Russia had ""no comments on the matter"" when asked by reporters about the drones. CNN first reported last month that a Russian delegation had visited an airfield in central Iran at least twice since June to examine weapons-capable drones, according to national security adviser Jake Sullivan and satellite imagery obtained exclusively by CNN. Iran began showcasing the Shahed-191 and Shahed-129 drones, also known as UAVs or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, to Russia at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran in June, US officials told CNN. Both types of drones are capable of carrying precision-guided missiles. Sullivan said in July that the US believes Iran intends to sell Russia hundreds of the drones that Russia can use in its war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has primarily been deploying Turkish-built Bayraktar UAVs to destroy Russian command posts, tanks and surface-to-air missile systems, while the Russians have been using homemade Orlan-10 drones for reconnaissance and electronic warfare. But the Russians have been struggling to replenish their supply, leading them to turn to Iran for the equipment, the US believes. US officials have also argued that the growing relationship between Iran and Russia exemplifies why the US needs to maintain its presence and influence in the Middle East. Ukraine, meanwhile, has pleaded with the US to provide more powerful armed drones like the Gray Eagle, but the US has been reluctant to provide them for fear that Russia could view it as overly escalatory.",49,4.478719222081201,5.94199634689295,-1.463277124811749,11

Colin Kahl, the under secretary of defense for policy, said at a press briefing that the US had sent ""a number"" of the missiles without specifying how many the US has provided or when they were sent. Kahl did not explicitly say what type of anti-radiation missile was sent. A defense official told CNN the type of missile sent was the AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM). Produced by Raytheon, HARMs have a range in excess of 30 miles, according to the US Air Force, making them one of the longer-range weapons the US has provided to Ukraine. The missiles can be used to target Russian anti-aircraft radar systems, such as the S-400, which have made it very difficult for the Ukrainian Air Force to operate over large swaths of Ukrainian airspace. The missiles can also target Russian counter-battery radars, which Russia uses to target Ukrainian artillery. Kahl said the missiles had been sent over ""in recent [Presidential Drawdown Authority] packages,"" but the five most recent packages, dating to July 1, make no mention of HARMs. ""In the near term, we've been doing lots of things to make Ukraine's existing air force stay in the air and be more capable,"" Kahl said. He pointed to the spare parts for Mig-29s that the US helped send into Ukraine to keep the Soviet-era fighter jets flying. Kahl then mentioned the missiles, saying they ""can have effects on Russian radars and other things."" The Ukrainians have not publicly acknowledged receiving or using HARMs. In recent days, open source reports have shown the remains of what appear to be the fin of a HARM missile that targeted a Russian position in Ukraine. Kahl announced the missiles in a briefing about the Pentagon's latest $1 billion weapons package for Ukraine, the largest package of US weapons to date. The package was focused on supplying ammunition for some of the key weapon systems the US has sent to Ukraine. That includes the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which the Ukrainian military has effectively used to target Russian command posts, ammo depots, and more, as well as the M777 howitzers that have been a critical part of the fight in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Russia, Kahl said, has had approximately 70,000-80,000 casualties of war, including killed and wounded in action, so far in the conflict. ""That number might be a little lower, little higher, but I think that's kind of in the ballpark,"" he said. He also added that Russia has lost between 3,000-4,000 armored vehicles. With this latest package, the US has committed to sending Ukraine a total of $9.1 billion in security assistance since the beginning of Russia's invasion in late February.",49,4.002181140113809,8.847617233834807,-4.845436093720998,8

The human rights watchdog published a press release last week accusing Ukrainian forces of putting civilians in harm's way by setting up military bases in residential areas, including schools and hospitals and launching attacks from populated civilian areas. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lashed out at the group's report, arguing that it tried to ""shift the responsibility"" of civilian deaths in Ukraine away from Russia. The report sparked the resignation of the head of Amnesty in Ukraine, Oksana Pokalchuk, who said she had tried to dissuade the organization from publishing the report as it appeared. ""If you don't live in a country occupied by invaders that are tearing it to pieces, you probably don't understand what it's like to condemn an ​​army of defenders,"" Pokalchuk said in a statement on Facebook. ""Such important reports, which are published at such a moment and in such a context, cannot fail to contain information about the other side of the war, about the one who started this war,"" she added. ""The organization created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives. Seeking to protect civilians, this research instead became a tool of Russian propaganda."" Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also hit out at the report, tweeting that it ""distorts reality, draws false moral equivalence between the aggressor and the victim, and boosts Russia's disinformation efforts."" Following the backlash, Amnesty said in a statement to CNN Sunday: ""While we fully stand by our findings, we regret the pain caused and wish to clarify a few crucial points."" The watchdog reiterated that it had ""documented how in all 19 of the towns and villages we visited, we found instances where Ukrainian forces had located themselves right next to where civilians were living, thereby potentially putting them at risk from incoming Russian fire."" ""We made this assessment based on the rules of international humanitarian law (IHL), which require all parties to a conflict to avoid locating, to the maximum extent feasible, military objectives within or near densely populated areas. The laws of war exist in part to protect civilians, and it is for this reason that Amnesty International urges governments to comply with them,"" the watchdog said. ""This does not mean that Amnesty International holds Ukrainian forces responsible for violations committed by Russian forces, nor that the Ukrainian military is not taking adequate precautions elsewhere in the country,"" it said. Experts not associated with Amnesty have found that patterns of violent acts by Russian forces in Ukraine meet the qualification of crimes against humanity. ""We must be very clear: Nothing we documented Ukrainian forces doing in any way justifies Russian violations,"" Amnesty said. ""Russia alone is responsible for the violations it has committed against Ukrainian civilians. Amnesty's work over the last six months and our multiple briefings and reports on Russia's violations and war crimes reflect their scale and the gravity of their impact on civilians."" Amnesty said it reached out to the Ukrainian government on July 29 detailing the findings. ""In our letter, we included GPS coordinates and other sensitive information about the locations, including schools and hospitals, where we had documented Ukrainian forces basing themselves among civilians.

2022-07-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/world/videos-allegedly-show-russians-castrating-ukrainian/index.html,'Appalling' videos alleged to show Russian soldiers castrating a Ukrainian soldier,"Videos alleged to show Russian soldiers castrating and killing a bound and gagged Ukrainian soldier are circulating on social media, drawing an accusation of potential war crimes from the United Nations and prompting a Ukrainian investigation into possible torture. The three videos appear to show a soldier wearing what look like yellow and blue patches -- the colors of the Ukrainian flag -- on the ground, with his hands tied behind his back, first being gagged, then mutilated, then shot. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos which circulated widely on social media after first appearing on a pro-Russian Telegram channel. CNN also has not independently verified the nationality of the perpetrators or the victim. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said it is appalled by the videos. In a statement issued late Friday, the Monitoring Mission said the ""torture and summary executions of prisoners of war and persons hors de combat are war crimes."" The Prosecutor General's office in Ukraine said it has launched a criminal investigation into the matter, ""based on the results of the video processing, which shows how persons in the uniform of servicemen of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are torturing a prisoner in the uniform of a serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Measures are being taken to establish all the circumstances of the crime."" The video that appears to come first shows the victim being gagged surrounded by at least four men, one of whom is wearing what looks like a Russian uniform with the ""Z"" insignia associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A second video shows the same man writhing on the ground as a man wearing blue surgical gloves and what appears to be a Russian uniform cuts off the victim's underwear with a box cutter. The man uses the same box cutter to castrate him, then holds the mutilated genitals up for the camera. In the video, the perpetrators can be heard saying ""hold him, hold him"" in Russian. The third video shows the bound and mutilated man being shot in the head and dragged away. CNN has contacted the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment about the videos. The UN Monitoring Mission said on Facebook it ""is appalled by the latest videos, apparently showing the beating, castration and shooting of a captured soldier from the Ukrainian Armed Forces by a man, who appears to be a member of the Russian armed forces or affiliated armed groups."" ""In one of the videos the tortured soldier appeared to be shot in the head and his body dragged into a ditch. If confirmed, these actions would constitute war crimes."" The UN Monitoring Mission said: ""Unfortunately, this is only the latest in a series of videos that have documented torture and extrajudicial killings of prisoners of war and persons hors de combat, committed by belligerent parties."" ""HRMMU has publicly reported on videos showing Ukrainian soldiers shooting the legs of three captured Russian soldiers and in a separate case shooting and killing an injured Russian soldier,"" the UN Monitoring Mission wrote. It added: ""All parties must refrain from torture, killings and threats of giving no quarter to captured combatants. They must promptly and effectively investigate all allegations of torture and unlawful killings."" High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell on Friday strongly condemned ""Russia's ongoing illegitimate and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine and its people brings further horrific atrocities day by day."" ""Evidence in form of appalling video footage has been widely shared on pro-Kremlin social networks today, in which Russian soldiers commit a heinous atrocity against a Ukrainian prisoner of war,"" Borrell said in a statement. Amnesty International has demanded an investigation into the videos. ""This horrific assault is yet another apparent example of complete disregard for human life and dignity in Ukraine committed by Russian forces. All those suspected of criminal responsibility must be investigated,"" said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International's Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. ""Since the start of Russia's war on Ukraine, Amnesty International has documented crimes under international law, like summary killings of captives by Russia-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine and extrajudicial executions of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces,"" she said.",45,4.852214467453597,5.514503443808121,-0.6622889763545246,3

In a statement, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the new tranche of sanctions ""is separate and distinct from the broad range of measures the United States and its allies and partners continue to impose on Russia's economy and financial system in response to its unlawful invasion of Ukraine."" Friday's sanctions hit ""two individuals and four entities that support the Kremlin's global malign influence operations and election interference activities,"" Blinken said, adding that they ""played various roles in Russia's attempts to manipulate the United States and our allies and partners, including Ukraine."" One of the individuals sanctioned Friday is Aleksandr Viktorovich Ionov, a Russian national who was also charged Friday by the Department of Justice for allegedly ""orchestrating a years-long foreign malign influence campaign that used various U.S. political groups to sow discord, spread pro-Russian propaganda, and interfere in elections within the United States."" According to the Treasury Department, Ionov is president and founder of the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia, which ""has maintained connections with separatists and anti-establishment groups in the United States and abroad"" and ""has received funding from Russia's National Charity Fund, a trust created by Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin which gathers money from Russia's state-owned companies and oligarchs."" He ""is also the president, founder, and 100% shareholder of Ionov Transkontinental, OOO (Ionov Transkontinental), which has a footprint in Iran, Venezuela, and Lebanon."" Both of those entities were sanctioned Friday, as was an entity called ""STOP-Imperialism"" that the Treasury Department says Ionov used to spread disinformation. In addition, a Russian national named Natalya Valeryevna Burlinova and her organization, the Center for Support and Development of Public Initiative Creative Diplomacy (PICREADI), were sanctioned. ""Despite trying to hide its relationship with the Russian government and its intelligence services, Russia's intelligence services direct and fund Burlinova and PICREADI,"" the Treasury Department said, noting that ""since at least 2017, Russia's intelligence services have tracked the activities and career paths of past participants in PICREADI's events."" Friday's sanctions come a day after the State Department's Rewards for Justice program announced a reward of up to $10 million for information on the Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency, its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin -- who is a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin -- ""and linked Russian entities and associates for their engagement in U.S. election interference.""",20,5.642816134432719,3.6449970959966347,1.9978190384360843,19
2022-07-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/politics/russian-influence-separatist-groups-charges/index.html,Russian accused of influencing US political groups to interfere in elections is indicted,"The Justice Department unveiled on Friday a conspiracy charge against a Russian national accused of working with FSB agents and using unnamed political groups in the US as foreign agents of Russia. Aleksandr Viktorovich Ionov allegedly orchestrated ""a years-long foreign malign influence campaign that used various U.S. political groups to sow discord, spread pro-Russian propaganda, and interfere in elections within the United States,"" according to a Justice Department statement. Prosecutors allege that the purpose of the conspiracy was to establish relationships that would ""further the interests of the Russian federation."" Ionov, the indictment alleges, worked with FSB agents to ""identify and exploit"" connections with the US political groups. The indictment describes some of the US political groups as ""separatist groups"" based in Florida and California that advocated for seceding from the US, and it alleges that Ionov had ""direction or control over these groups on behalf of the FSB,"" providing financial support for the group and using them to publish Russian and pro-separatist propaganda online and on the radio. Six US citizens worked with and were funded by Ionov, including two unnamed Florida residents who ran for public office in 2017 and 2019, the indictment said. The unindicted co-conspirators allegedly worked to promote Russian interests, secession movements in California, and led pro-separatist political groups in the US, all with funding from the FSB. According to the indictment, Ionov supported the 2019 campaign of one these alleged co-conspirators for local office in Florida by participating in campaign events and providing funds. Ionov also allegedly sent updates on the campaign's progress to FSB agents on the candidate whom, Ionov allegedly wrote to the FSB, ""we supervise."" The indictment alleges that Ionov pushed false claims about Russia's invasion of Ukraine as part of the conspiracy, including with a video appearance Ionov allegedly made in a March video conference hosted by the Florida-based group. Ionov, who says he's currently in Russia, rejected the charges in a statement to CNN: ""Today we received disturbing news about my inclusion in the sanctions list and the initiation of a criminal case. I have reviewed the documents and consulted with lawyers in the USA. Until now, I do not understand the essence of the accusation, since there are no specific references in the documents to persons in the Russian government for whom I allegedly worked. I was particularly struck by the fact that I allegedly work for the special services. At the same time, the names and officials are not called. I consider these accusations destructive."" The US Treasury Department also announced sanctions Friday against Ionov and Natalya Valeryevna Burlinova, the president of an organization allegedly connected to Russian intelligence service, and their organizations. ""The Kremlin has repeatedly sought to threaten and undermine our democratic processes and institutions,"" Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson said in a statement Friday. ""The United States will continue our extensive work to counter these efforts and safeguard our democracy from Russia's interference."" Under the law that Ionov is accused of violating, Ionov faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The indictment references media reports describing Ionov as fundraising for the defense of Maria Butina, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to acting as a foreign agent in an effort to influence US gun rights groups. Prosecutors allege that Ionov was warned by an FSB agent who commented on one such article in 2019 that sanctions could be imposed against him. The indictment points to several episodes of the alleged influence campaign. In 2015, a member of the Florida-based group identified as unindicted co-conspirator UIC-1, traveled to Russia on two occasions -- the first time, to meet with Ionov, and on a second occasion, to attend a ""separatist conference"" in Moscow, according to the indictment. Also that year, Ionov allegedly worked with another member of the Florida-based group on a petition to be sent to the United Nations. The alleged conspiracy continued through 2016, prosecutors say, with requests from Ionov that the Florida-based group organize a four-city tour to show that people are opposed to the ""US colonial government"" and that the group made statements supporting the Russian Olympic team amid doping controversy that year. The indictment also accuses Ionov of emailing with members of the California-based group about plans to demonstrate at California's state capital in 2018. Ionov communicated details about the demonstration to an FSB agent, who complained that the rally did not amount to an ""historic"" demonstration, the indictment said. ""The prosecution of this criminal conduct is essential to protecting the American public when foreign governments seek to inject themselves into the American political process,"" US Attorney Roger B. Handberg for the Middle District of Florida, which is where the indictment was handed up, said in a statement. ""We will continue to work with our partners at the FBI to investigate these events, and we will continue to follow the evidence to ensure justice is done.""

2022-07-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/asia/south-korea-poland-tanks-howitzer-ukraine-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"Poland to buy hundreds of South Korean tanks, howitzers after sending arms to Ukraine","Poland is buying almost 1,000 tanks, more than 600 pieces of artillery and dozens of fighter jets from South Korea, in part to replace equipment donated to Ukraine to help Kyiv fight the Russian invasion, the Polish Ministry of Defense told CNN on Tuesday. The agreement, expected to be officially announced in Poland on Wednesday, will see Warsaw purchase 980 tanks based on the South Korean K2 model, 648 self-propelled K9 armored howitzers, and 48 FA-50 fighter jets, the ministry said. It would not confirm the value of the deal. The first 180 K2 tanks, made by Hyundai Rotem and equipped with auto-loading 120mm guns, are expected to arrive this year, with the production of 800 upgraded tanks starting in 2026 in Poland, according to the ministry. The first 48 K9 howitzers, made by Hanwha Defense, are also expected to arrive this year, with delivery of a second batch of 600 due to start in 2024. From 2026 these will be produced in Poland, the ministry said. The ministry said these armored vehicles would, in part, replace the Soviet-era tanks that Poland has donated to Ukraine to use in its fight against Russia. The ministry's comments to CNN come after Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak tweeted on July 22 that the deal would ""significantly increase Poland's security and the strength of the Polish Army."" CNN has reached out to the South Korean Defense Acquisition Program Administration and the arms manufacturers involved for comment. Chun In-Bum, a retired South Korean general, said the deal with Poland is Seoul's single biggest weapons export pact ever. He also praised the weapons involved. ""The K9 (howitzer)... is probably the best artillery system in the world, rivaled only by the German system. The FA-50 is a combat version of the T-50, which has gained a reputation for being the best trainer in the world inventory. The K2 tank in its latest version will be better than anything South Korea has to date,"" Chun said. Higher profile for Korean arms Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said the arms deal had its roots in the administration of former President Moon Jae-in, who sought large foreign contracts to boost South Korea's defense industries. Moon's successor, President Yoon Suk Yeol, who took office in May, also wants to push such exports, Easley said. ""But the war in Ukraine increases the geopolitical stakes"" for Seoul, Easley said. The profitable arms deal with Poland, a NATO member, means South Korea will be expected to share the ""burden for defense of the international order,"" Easley said. ""Washington and NATO will expect Seoul to increase assistance to Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia, even if doing so comes at some cost to the South Korean economy,"" Easley said. Since joining NATO in 1999, Poland has become a key member of the 30-member alliance, and has been purchasing US-made military equipment, including Abrams main battle tanks and F-35 stealth fighter jets. Poland has also become a big backer of the government in Kyiv following Russia's invasion, making deals to send more than 200 tanks and self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine. Urgent need During a visit to Seoul in May, the Polish defense minister said the war in Ukraine showed Poland's urgent need for South Korean arms. ""We talked about accelerating the deliveries of these weapons to the Polish Army. Why is it important? Because of the war on our eastern border. It is important for the Polish Armed Forces to be equipped with modern equipment, proven equipment, and such is the equipment produced by Korea,"" Błaszczak said at the time. He said South Korea and Poland faced similar security situations and therefore needed similar weapons. ""Why is Korean equipment proven? Because Korea has the challenge of its northern neighbor, who also conducts an aggressive policy, so our task is to equip the Polish Armed Forces with modern equipment. Equipment that will deter the aggressor. Such equipment is undoubtedly ... produced in Korea,"" Błaszczak said. Some defense industry analysts question whether the South Korean weapons are the right fit for Europe, however. Nicholas Drummond, a defense industry analyst specializing in land warfare and a former British Army officer, said the K2 tank is essentially a less capable version of the German Leopard 2 main battle tank. ""Same gun. Same engine and gearbox. But overall less sophisticated with inferior electronic architecture. ... Not a bad tank. But not class of the field,"" he said. Drummond also said hardware made in Asia may eventually face supply chain problems during a war in Europe. ""It is right that Asian countries buy from Korea as these customers can easily be supported in time of war. But supporting European customers in an emergency is likely to be more challenging,"" he said. South Korea's ground attack jet The FA-50 jet, produced by Korea Aerospace Industries in association with US defense giant Lockheed Martin, is a supersonic light combat aircraft, suitable for ground attack and some air-to-air missions. The plane, flown by the South Korean Air Force since 2013, is armed with Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, Maverick air-to-ground missiles, and a three-barreled 30mm cannon for strafing runs. It can also use precision-guided and gravity bombs. The FA-50, in its combat and training versions, has found export customers in Colombia, Indonesia, Iraq, the Philippines and Thailand. But with its order for 48 planes, Poland would become the biggest operator of the jets outside South Korea.",49,6.9677286455289105,7.229083895639664,-0.26135525011075345,21
2022-07-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/politics/russia-solarwinds-hackers/index.html,"Russian hackers behind SolarWinds breach continue to scour US and European organizations for intel, researchers say","The Russian hackers behind a sweeping 2020 breach of US government networks have in recent months continued to hack US organizations to collect intelligence while also targeting an unnamed European government that is a NATO member, cybersecurity analysts tell CNN. The new findings show how relentless the hacking group — which US officials have linked with Russia's foreign intelligence service — is in its pursuit of intelligence held by the US and its allies, and how adept the hackers are at targeting widely used cloud-computing technologies. The hacking efforts come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to fray US-Russia relations and drive intelligence collection efforts from both governments. ""In recent months, [the hacking group] has compromised the networks of US-based organizations that have data of interest to the Russian government,"" said Charles Carmakal, senior vice president and chief technology officer at US cybersecurity firm Mandiant, which has responded to the hacks. Carmakal declined to elaborate on the types or number of US organizations that had been breached. In separate activity revealed Tuesday, US cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks said that the Russian hacking group had been using popular services like Dropbox and Google Drive to try to deliver malicious software to the embassies of an unnamed European government in Portugal and Brazil in May and June. Though it's unclear how successful those hacking attempts were, they could offer the hackers a foothold into computer networks to collect intelligence, Jen Miller-Osborn, deputy director of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42, told CNN. The two hacking campaigns offer the latest example of how the elite Russian hacking group tried to evade US government and private investigators pursuing it. The Russian hacking group is best known for using tampered software made by federal contractor SolarWinds to breach at least nine US agencies in activity that came to light in December 2020. The attackers were undetected for months in the unclassified email networks of the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and others. The group continued to target US and European government networks, and software providers serving them, throughout 2021, according to researchers. Google and Dropbox told CNN that they took steps to thwart the latest hacking activity. ""We were aware of the activity identified in this report, and had already proactively taken steps to protect any potential targets,"" said Shane Huntley, senior director of Google's Threat Analysis Group. A Dropbox spokesperson told CNN that the company ""disabled user accounts"" involved in the alleged Russian hacking campaign ""immediately"" after they were reported. Russian tracking of Ukrainian hackers Another sign of Russia's voracious appetite for intelligence came Tuesday when researchers from Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) detailed a possible effort, linked with Russia' FSB intelligence service, to track Ukrainian hackers who have targeted Russian organizations. The hacking group set up a web application designed to mimic a tool used by the Ukraine IT Army — a band of hackers encouraged by the Ukrainian government that has targeted Russian corporate and government websites, according to Google. From there, the hackers may have been able to track who downloaded the app and potentially collect information on Ukrainian hackers who have been a thorn in the side of the Russian government. Someone even sent a link to download the bugged app in the Ukrainian IT Army's Telegram channel, according to Billy Leonard, a security engineer at Google TAG. The group responsible, Leonard said, is known as Turla. It is considered one of the Russian government's top-tier espionage teams alongside the hacking group responsible for the SolarWinds intrusions and other groups, and has been linked to skilled break-ins of Western government networks for years. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Turla has targeted government organizations in Latvia, Lithuania and other European countries, Leonard said. But this was the first time the hackers were spotted in Ukraine in four or five months, Leonard told CNN. Adrian Nish, a cybersecurity executive at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence who also observed the Turla activity, said that it made sense for Russian hacking teams to search for new intelligence in Ukraine as the war drags on. ""Given Russia's faltering progress in achieving their goals in Ukraine it is to be expected that efforts of state intelligence apparatus are focused on gathering information on and disrupting opposition forces in any way that they can,"" Nish told CNN.",20,6.054556483616157,4.35357644939583,1.7009800342203265,2
2022-07-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/politics/fbi-nsa-2022-midterm-elections-wray/index.html,FBI and NSA directors warn of evolving foreign interference threat ahead of US midterms,"US officials are on alert for multifaceted election interference threats from adversaries like Iran, China and Russia -- including hacking, disinformation and influence operations -- as the midterm elections approach, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Tuesday. ""We have to be concerned about hybrid threats,"" Wray said at a cybersecurity conference at Fordham University in New York. That includes a situation in which foreign operatives might use an ""unremarkable cyber incident"" to sow ""panic or lack of confidence in our election infrastructure,"" Wray said. Asked whether the war in Ukraine may distract Russia from interfering in the US midterm elections, Wray said he was ""quite confident the Russians can walk and chew gum"" and that US officials were preparing accordingly. US officials have long been preparing for foreign operatives to amply misinformation spread about the US voting process by supporters of President Donald Trump who falsely believe the 2020 election was stolen. Added to those concerns are the threats of physical violence that many US election officials have faced from voters who believe the false fraud claims. In guarding against foreign threats, the US military's offensive and defensive cyber unit, Cyber Command, has played a much more prominent role in recent years. Cyber Command has conducted about 50 different ""hunt forward"" operations across 16 countries since 2018 as part of an effort to defend against foreign interference efforts aimed at the US electoral process or other US interests, Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of the command and of the National Security Agency, said in a panel discussion alongside Wray. Those efforts will continue through the midterm elections, Nakasone said. ""I'm thinking about new and unique ways that an adversary might try to disrupt or try to influence our elections."" After Russian hackers leaked Democrats' emails in the 2016 US presidential election, federal agencies like the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security greatly expanded their efforts to support local election officials with defensive resources and threat briefings. The threat of physical violence against US election officials has been a top concern as the Justice Department continues to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. ""There are way too many people in this country, and to some extent other countries as well, who are choosing to manifest their ideological, political or social views through violence and destruction of federal property,"" Wray said. ""Or in the case of January 6, that plus an effort to interfere with one of our most sacred constitutional processes.""",20,4.792094017800861,5.87116582350078,-1.0790718056999191,14

Iran began showcasing the Shahed-191 and Shahed-129 drones, also known as UAVs or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, to Russia at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran in June, US officials told CNN. Both types of drones are capable of carrying precision-guided missiles. ""We have information that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with several hundred UAVs, including weapons-capable UAVs,"" Sullivan told CNN in a statement. ""We assess an official Russian delegation recently received a showcase of Iranian attack-capable UAVs,"" Sullivan added. ""We are releasing these images captured in June showing Iranian UAVs that the Russian government delegation saw that day. This suggests ongoing Russian interest in acquiring Iranian attack-capable UAVs."" Sullivan said that to the US' knowledge, the June visit ""was the first time a Russian delegation has visited this airfield for such a showcase."" A Russian delegation visited the airfield for a similar showcase again on July 5, the officials said. The news comes as Biden is wrapping up his trip to the Middle East, where Iran was a key point of discussion among the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries. A US official told CNN that the growing partnership between Iran and Russia exemplifies why the US needs to maintain its presence and influence in the Middle East. Biden remains under increasing pressure from Middle Eastern allies to come up with a viable plan to constrain Iran, as hopes for reviving the 2015 nuclear deal have faded following stalled talks in Doha, Qatar, last month. White House officials revealed earlier this week that newly declassified US intelligence indicates that Iran is expected to supply Russia with ""hundreds"" of drones for use in the war in Ukraine, with Iran preparing to begin training Russian forces on how to operate them as early as late July. Russia, the US now believes, has apparently turned to Iran to help replenish its drone stockpiles. It is unclear how sophisticated or effective those drones will be, however. Russia had previously turned to China for help in supporting its war in Ukraine, US officials disclosed in March. As of late May, the US had seen no evidence that China had provided any military or economic support to Russia for the invasion, Sullivan told reporters at the time.",49,5.267152742406767,5.464422480124027,-0.19726973771726009,11
2022-07-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/europe/ukraine-western-weapons-russia-front-lines-intl-cmd/index.html,Ukraine's new US rockets are causing fresh problems for Russia,"There's a new and potentially very significant factor in the Ukrainian conflict: the Ukrainians' ability to use recently supplied Western systems to hit Russian command posts, logistical hubs and ammunition dumps a long way beyond the front lines. In the past week, there have been enormous explosions in several occupied areas in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. The available evidence, from satellite imagery and Western analysts, is that the targeting has been highly effective. For months the Ukrainian military pleaded for long-range precision artillery and rocket systems from Western partners. Now they have them and are deploying them to considerable effect in both the south and east of the country. The Ukrainian military is not giving away many specifics but Vadim Denysenko, a senior official at the Interior Ministry, said Wednesday that in the past two weeks, ""above all things thanks to the weapons that Ukraine received, we were able to destroy approximately two dozen warehouses with weapons and stocks of fuel and lubricants. This will certainly affect the intensity of fire"" the Russians can muster, he said. Best-in-class is the US-supplied HIMARS multiple launch rocket system, but the Ukrainians have also received M777 howitzers from both the US and Canada, and Caesar long-range howitzers from France. In addition, the UK has committed to providing M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), which are more powerful than HIMARS, but it's unclear when Ukraine will complete training on the system and deploy it. The HIMARS' versatility is in its name: the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. Its mobility makes it harder to target and it can be crewed by just eight soldiers. The rockets supplied to Ukraine have a range of 70 to 80 kilometers (about 50 miles). And their GPS guidance systems make them extremely accurate. As Mick Ryan, a military analyst and former Australian major-general, puts it: ""It is used to destroy critical communications nodes, command posts, airfields, and important logistics facilities."" Senior Russian officers are therefore especially vulnerable. HIMARS' accuracy also means the Ukrainians can worry less about civilian casualties. The guided rockets are accurate to within two to three meters, two defense officials told CNN, allowing the Ukrainians to use far fewer rounds to hit targets precisely at distance. The HIMARS appears to have been used in a massive strike against a warehouse in the town of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region on Monday night. The strike set off secondary explosions and caused widespread damage, according to satellite imagery reviewed by CNN. The imagery showed how precise the attack had been, leaving just one small crater. Local pro-Russian officials said parts of one HIMARS rockets were recovered; the serial numbers matched the weapon. There were also large explosions in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, setting off multiple detonations. The same happened at Shakhtarsk in Donetsk and in the Kherson region at the weekend, as well as near Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia last week. Altogether, it appears that about a dozen targets deep behind Russian lines have been hit in July, most of them at least 40 kilometers behind the front -- a distance at which accuracy with old Tochka-U missiles would be difficult. The Ukrainians have also been firing HIMARS at night, making it more difficult for the Russians to spot and strike the launchers. Russian forces have struggled to fight at night since the beginning of the conflict, and the Ukrainians are still using this to their advantage. Changing the battlefield Targeting may also have been made easier by the way the Russian military stores and moves its weapons. Phillips O'Brien, professor strategic studies at St Andrews University, says the Nova Kakhovka strike is revealing ""about the state of the logistics war and the real problems the Russians face."" The target was adjacent to a rail hub, vital to the Russian logistics effort to sustain their offensive, and so was an obvious target. ""The Russians left a ludicrously easy to locate, major supply depot exactly where someone would expect to find it. Either the Russians are unable to react because of command failure or they can't actually move the depots because they lack the road movement,"" O'Brien tweeted. One Ukrainian official hinted that targeting the warehouse had been easy. Serhiy Khlan, a member of Kherson regional council, said on Facebook: ""In Nova Kakhovka minus one Russian ammo depot. They brought, brought, stockpiled, stockpiled and now have fireworks at night."" Ben Hodges, the former commander of the US Army in Europe, tweeted after the Kherson attack at the weekend: ""Least favorite job in the Russian Army? Ammunition handler."" In a briefing last week, a senior US Defense Department official said that ""the focus on higher capability, precision, further-range weapons"" for Ukraine was front and center. On Friday, the Pentagon announced a shipment to Ukraine of 1,000 rounds of 155mm artillery shells -- but a newer munition with greater accuracy, according to the official. The Ukrainians have been expending 155mm munitions at a rate of 3,000 a day. Like HIMARS, the more accurate rounds should mean fewer are needed. The official contended that HIMARS was changing the battlefield. ""What we've seen is the ability of the Ukrainians to use these HIMAR systems to significantly disrupt the ability of the Russians to move forward."" ""If the Russians think they can outlast the Ukrainians, they need to rethink that,"" the official added. A Russian military reporter, Yuri Kotenok, said this week that the HIMARS represents ""a serious threat. The liberated areas of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, the DPR and the LPR, as well as the territory of Russia, fall under the possible fire of HIMARS."" Kotenok, who has nearly 300,000 followers on Telegram, said Russian air defenses need to be improved -- as does the targeting of HIMARS, whether in transit or deployed. He said that ""If this continues, it is necessary to hit the decision-making centers. Our limitations in retaliatory strikes against the enemy are to some extent incomprehensible to me."" Another Russian reporter, Roman Sapenkov, said he witnessed the strike at the weekend on the Russian base at Kherson's airport. ""I was struck by the fact that the whole packet, five or six rockets, landed practically on a penny. Usually MLRS lands in a wide area, and at maximum range they scatter like a fan,"" he wrote, referring to multiple launch rocket systems that are less advanced than HIMARS or the M777. ""It is clear this is just the beginning ... They will cover all the command posts and military facilities; the data for this has been collected for the last 4 months."" The importance of pallets One problem for the Russians may be the way they transport munitions, which is where the humble pallet comes into play. Few Russian military trucks include a crane to lift heavy munitions, which are rarely carried on pallets but loaded and unloaded by hand. Plenty of ageing Soviet ZIL trucks have been seen in Ukraine. Moving weapons and ammunition this way is cumbersome, time-consuming and potentially gives enemy surveillance a greater opportunity to detect such shipments. By contrast, the UK and US militaries palletize much of their ammunition or carry it in containers. The Russian way of war -- as witnessed over the last three months in eastern Ukraine -- relies on huge artillery barrages to pulverize targets before moving forward. Russian military doctrine has always emphasized a massive use of artillery, MLRS and mortars. That demands constant resupply: Some analysts calculate that Russia is using at least 7,000 shells and rockets a day in Donbas, and often many more. Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said Wednesday: ""The Russian army does not stop shelling. However, most likely, it saves the existing stocks of shells, because their supply has been interrupted by the work of our new long-range weapons."" Ukrainian officials claim that the Russians are being thrown off-balance by their growing capability for long-range precision attacks. In and around Melitopol, for example, the Russians have imposed restrictions on civilian movements in recent days. The area has seen at least two major strikes this month against Russian bases. But for the Ukrainians to sustain this rate of strikes requires an unimpeded conduit of munitions from the West. The Ukrainian military is transitioning from an organization largely reliant on Soviet-era artillery and rocket systems -- with inadequate ammunition -- to using precision Western weapons with enough ammunition in a matter of months. Also unknown is whether any of the handful of HIMARS so far shipped have been taken out by Russian fire. The Ukrainian military and defense ministries avoid providing details about their deployment. Ryan cautions that while the HIMARS ""has provided the Ukrainian Armed Forces with a new 'Long Hand' to attack the Russian invaders, there is no such thing as a silver bullet solution in war."" But US officials are confident that the accuracy of the weapon -- as well as other accurate long-range systems -- will progressively change the battlefield.",49,6.277837585059505,5.711977444859131,0.5658601402003738,13
2022-07-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/politics/osce-report-russia-war-crimes/index.html,Experts document alleged crimes against humanity committed by Russian forces in Ukraine,"A new report from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe found that patterns of violent acts by Russian forces in Ukraine meet the qualification of crimes against humanity, detailing horrific actions by Russian forces including the discovery of torture chambers at a summer camp in Bucha. The new report released Thursday was the latest instance of groups documenting potential war crimes committed by Russian forces. The OSCE experts who put together the report traveled to Kyiv and met with Ukrainian authorities there as well as Bucha and Irpin, where they found ""grave breaches"" of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention. The report ""found credible evidence"" that suggested ""some patterns of violent acts which had been repeatedly documented during the conflict,"" including ""killing, rape abductions or massive deportations of civilians, qualified as a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population."" The OSCE mission that compiled the report wrote that 1.3 million Ukrainian citizens have been deported against their will to Russia and said there was evidence that tens of thousands of civilians had been detained at so-called filtration centers before being transported to Russian-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine. US Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter said in a statement that the report ""gives us an opportunity to pull back and document the unconscionable atrocity crimes, human rights violations, and abuses members of Russia's forces have committed."" This week's report is the second that OSCE has released documenting atrocities committed against the Ukrainian population. In April, the group released its first report with similar findings of ""credible evidence"" suggesting violations of ""even the most fundamental human rights."" Together, both reports ""comprise the most comprehensive accounting of evidence to date of Russia's human rights abuses, international humanitarian law violations,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement after the second report's release Thursday. ""The United States and our partners will seek to hold accountable those responsible for all human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including war crimes, they commit in Ukraine,"" Price added. The report noted that it had identified ""numerous violations"" of international humanitarian law that constituted war crimes, ""if the responsible individuals can be found."" ""These violations included mistreatment of prisoners of war, deliberate killing of civilians, deliberate attacks against civilians and against civilian objects, including schools, hospitals or cultural property, or the failure to respect the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions,"" the report said. The second report covered the period between April 1 to June 25. The OSCE experts traveled to Ukraine to collect evidence, including visiting the towns of Bucha and Irpin, which the report said were ""two emblematic examples of the breaches of International Humanitarian Law under the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, which constitute war crimes."" The experts noted that photographic and video evidence showed Russian forces caried out ""targeted, organized killings of civilians in Bucha"" who were found shot dead with their hands tied behind their backs. 'Series of torture chambers' The report documented a ""series of torture chambers separated by concrete walls"" discovered at a summer camp in Bucha, including a room that the report said appeared to be used for executions with bullet holes in the walls. In another room where experts said there was evidence of torture and waterboarding, five dead men were found. ""They were covered with burns, bruises, and lacerations,"" the report said. In another village in Bucha, the bodies of 18 men, women, and children were discovered in a basement. The report said that ""some had their ears cut off, while others had their teeth pulled out."" The OSCE mission wrote that reports of women and girls being raped and sexually abused by Russian forces ""have become abundant,"" especially in newly occupied territories. The report noted several particularly atrocious cases, including a report from the Commissioner for Human Rights Denisova, who said that 25 girls aged 14-24 were kept in a basement in Bucha and gang-raped. Nine became pregnant, the report said. The report also documented instances of Ukrainian civilians being used as ""human shields,"" being forced to fight alongside Russians against their own country in the ongoing war and being displaced to Russia without their consent. The report noted, ""Russian soldiers used over 300 Ukrainian civilians as human shields and held them captive for 25 days in March in the basement of Yahidne School, where a major Russian military camp was located."" Conscription, meaning forced military service, ""was imposed on all local men between the age of 18 and 65 in areas under Russian control in the Donbas as well as of the oblasts of Kharkiv, Kherson, and Sumy,"" the report said. ""Approximately 2,000 children from various orphanages and children's institutions"" have been ""purportedly transferred to Russia, even though they have living relatives and were in the institutions only for medical care,"" according to the report.",45,7.957336073424329,6.665262574245527,1.2920734991788017,4
2022-07-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/11/politics/iran-russia-weapons-capable-drones/index.html,White House says Iran is preparing to supply Russia with weapons-capable drones,"Newly declassified US intelligence indicates that Iran is expected to supply Russia with ""hundreds"" of drones -- including weapons-capable drones -- for use in the war in Ukraine, with Iran preparing to begin training Russian forces on how to operate them as early as late July, according to White House officials. ""Information indicates that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with up to several hundred (unmanned aerial vehicles), including weapons-capable UAVs on an expedited timeline,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House press briefing on Monday. ""Our information further indicates that Iran is preparing to train Russian forces to use these UAVs, with initial training session slated in as soon as early July. It's unclear whether Iran has delivered any of these UAVs to Russia already,"" he continued. A spokesperson at the White House National Security Council told CNN that the information Sullivan described to reporters was based on recently declassified intelligence. Sullivan argued that news of Iran supplying the drones is evidence that Russia's attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks are coming at the ""severe"" cost of depleting of its own weapons. News of Iran's supply of drones to Russia came a day before President Joe Biden's first trip to the Middle East since taking office, with stops in Israel and Saudi Arabia. Iran's actions in the region and its nuclear program are expected to be a major topic of discussion. Biden remains under increasing pressure from Middle Eastern allies to come up with a viable plan to constrain Iran, as hopes for reviving the 2015 nuclear deal have faded following stalled talks in Doha, Qatar, last month. Sullivan on Monday brought up how similar drones were provided by Iran to Yemen's Houthi rebels to attack Saudi Arabia before a ceasefire was put in place earlier this year. Drones have been a key component of the war in Ukraine on both sides, with the Ukrainian military using Turkish-built Bayraktar UAVs to destroy Russian command posts, tanks and surface-to-air missile systems, and the Russians using homemade Orlan-10 drones for reconnaissance and electronic warfare. But in nearly five months of war, the number of drones on each side has been dwindling as they have been shot down or crashed. Ukraine's allies, including Lithuania and Poland, have begun crowdfunding campaigns to purchase new Bayraktar drones for the Ukrainian military, and the US has provided Ukraine with small, kamikaze drones called Switchblades. The US has also been weighing whether to provide Ukraine with larger drones that can be armed with Hellfire missiles. But Russia, the US now believes, has apparently turned to Iran to help replenish its drone stockpiles. It is unclear how sophisticated or effective those drones will be, however. Russia had previously turned to China for help in supporting its war in Ukraine, US officials disclosed in March. As of late May, the US had seen no evidence that China had provided any military or economic support to Russia for the invasion, Sullivan told reporters at the time. Iran, however, has sought closer relations with Russia in recent months. In January, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and told him that now was the time for Russia and Iran to confront ""the power of the Americans with an increased synergy between our two countries,"" according to the New York Times.

The package is valued at $400 million and is drawing from Presidential Drawdown Authority funding only, meaning the US is sending weapons directly from US stockpiles of weapons. The package includes four additional rocket systems, additional ammunition for those systems, three tactical vehicles to ""recover equipment, support Ukrainian efforts to repair, resupply as the battle continues,"" 1,000 rounds of 155 mm artillery ammunition, demolition munitions, counter battery systems, and spare parts and other equipment, the official said. The 1,000 rounds of 155 mm artillery ammunition that the US is providing to Ukraine in this package is a ""new type"" of ammunition that the US has not provided to Ukraine previously, the official added. ""It has greater precision, it offers Ukraine precise targeting, precise capability for specific targets, it will save ammunition, it will be more effective due to the precision, so it's a further evolution in our support for Ukraine in this battle for the Donbas,"" the official said. The US has provided Ukraine with 12 high mobility artillery rocket systems total with the commitment of these additional four systems, the official said. A senior military official said ""upwards of 100"" Ukrainians have been trained on the systems so far. Reports that Russians have destroyed two high mobility artillery rocket systems systems are false, the official added. ""The ones that have already been provided are fully accounted for, Ukrainians are still using them in the fight,"" the official said. Meanwhile, the US State Department on Saturday announced an additional humanitarian aid package for Ukraine totaling nearly $368 million. It will provide food, water, shelter, health care and other humanitarian services to Ukrainians and others affected by Russia's invasion. The funding will include nearly $288 million through the State Department and an additional $80 million through the US Agency for International Development. ""As we move into the fifth month of Russia's brutal assault on Ukraine, we continue to call for Russia to end hostilities immediately, facilitate unhindered humanitarian access in Ukraine, and allow sustained safe passage for those who seek to flee to safety.

Access to Congress.gov was intermittently disrupted from around 9 p.m. ET Thursday until the website was restored to normal operation ""just after"" 11 p.m. ET, April Slayton, director of communications for the Library of Congress, which runs the website, told CNN. ""The Library of Congress used existing measures to address the attack quickly, resulting in minimal down time,"" Slayton said in an email. ""The Library's network was not compromised and no data was lost as a result of the attack."" A Russian-speaking hacking group known as Killnet claimed responsibility for the hack on their Telegram channel. The post included a screenshot of an error message on Congress.gov overlaid with an image of President Joe Biden with a puzzled look on his face. The hackers used a popular tactic known as a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), according to Slayton, which floods computer servers with phony web traffic in an attempt to knock websites offline. Congress.gov displays information on bills, hearings and other deliberations of Congress. While DDoS attacks can have material consequences, such as when customers can't access banking websites, they are sometimes more about making a statement and getting noticed. In the prelude to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, the White House blamed Russian military intelligence for a series of DDoS attacks on Ukrainian government websites. The war in Ukraine has triggered a wave of pro-Russia and pro-Ukrainian hackers who have made political statements and targeted infrastructure in the two countries. Killnet last week claimed responsibility for DDoS attacks on websites of government agencies and private firms in Lithuania. The hackers said it was retaliation for Lithuania blocking the shipment of some goods to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. US officials have been on high alert for months for retaliatory Russian cyberattacks after the Biden administration imposed stiff sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. But there have been no reports of high-impact hacks on US organizations tied to Russian government operatives.",20,6.430383749416038,4.636534465214011,1.793849284202027,2

FBI Director Christopher Wray and MI5 Director General Ken McCallum held the event in London to highlight the joint work by the two security agencies to thwart what they said was the most serious challenge from espionage and hacking by the Chinese government. Beyond the stealing of technology, China now is also making moves to shield its economy from any future sanctions should it try to take over Taiwan by force, drawing lessons from western efforts to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, Wray said. ""We've seen China looking for ways to insulate their economy against potential sanctions, trying to cushion themselves from harm if they do anything to draw the ire of the international community,"" Wray said. ""In our world, we call that kind of behavior a clue."" He cited recent estimates from a Yale University study that western businesses have lost $59 billion as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war. ""And if China does invade Taiwan,"" Wray said, ""we could see the same thing again, at a much larger scale."" McCallum called attention to the fact Wednesday's event was the first time FBI and MI5 leaders have held a joint public event. The two agencies have close ties, with MI5 officers working at the FBI and FBI agents at MI5. Business and universities for decades sought access to the growing Chinese market as a way to expand their businesses. But the risk has also grown. ""The widespread Western assumption that growing prosperity within China and increasing connectivity with the West would automatically lead to greater political freedom has been shown to be plain wrong,"" McCallum said. ""But the Chinese Communist Party is interested in our democratic, media and legal systems. Not to emulate them, sadly, but to use them for its gain."" Wray cited recent FBI investigations of Chinese intelligence activity including an effort to target a US congressional candidate in New York because of ties to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests that were crushed by the Chinese military. He said the FBI had also caught people working for Chinese companies trying to dig up fields in rural areas of the US to try to get access to genetically modified seeds. McCallum said MI-5 is now running seven times more investigations than in 2018 related to Chinese activity in the UK.",20,5.511653736045705,5.296566707203176,0.21508702884252884,14

The attack hit a housing block, killing 16 people, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Services. Another four people, including a child, died when a missile hit a community center, while a third missile landed in a field. At least 40 people were injured, responders said. ""We don't expect to find anyone alive, but there is a chance,"" first deputy interior minister Yevhenii Yenin said on Friday, speaking from the scene of the attacks. Images from the scene showed the residential building torn apart and debris strewn across the ground. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is conducting terrorism against his country's cities and people. ""This is not a single strike and not an accident, as the Russian mass media say every day. This is a targeted Russian missile attack, Russian terror against our cities, towns, our people -- adults and children,"" he said during a meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre in Kyiv. He described the Russian missile as a ""supersonic cruise anti-ship missile"" that was ""created to attack aircraft carriers and other large military ships, and the Russian army used it against an ordinary building with ordinary civilians."" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemned the strikes on Twitter, saying: ""Terrorist state Russia continues its war against civilians with overnight missile strikes on Odesa region killing dozens, including children. I urge partners to provide Ukraine with modern missile defense systems as soon as possible. Help us save lives and put an end to this war."" One of the buildings struck by the strikes was a rehabilitation center for treating Moldovan children with health problems, according to Moldova's Minister of Health Ala Nemerenco. In a statement on Facebook, Nemerenco said that although the building itself was not badly damaged, one employee was killed and five were injured in the attack. The renovated sanatorium gave ""children with health problems in the Republic of Moldova the opportunity to benefit from medical rehabilitation services on the Black Sea coast,"" Nemerenco said. She paid tribute to the facilities' medical staff who were injured and killed in the Russian bombardment. ""These peaceful people made the days of Moldova's children more beautiful; they took care of their rehabilitation with a lot of love and dedication, and we wish them from the bottom of our hearts a total recovery. To the family of the deceased colleague, we express our deepest condolences and sorrow."" The Moldovan-owned rehabilitation center had been closed to patients since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, said Nemerenco. No children are thought to have been at the center at the time of the attack. Fighting has raged across the Odesa region, which borders the strategically significant Black Sea, for several weeks. But some Ukrainian officials are cautiously optimistic that the regaining of Snake Island, a Ukrainian outpost on the Black Sea, could mean a reduction of shelling toward Odesa. ""It's now known why the enemy took (Snake) island. They filled the territory with the means of destruction and fired from them,"" state border service spokesman Andrii Demchenko said at a briefing Friday. ""We hope now shelling of the territory of Ukraine will decrease."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Friday that Russia targets civilian areas in Ukraine and repeated the frequent claim that it focuses its air strikes on buildings containing ammunition or training troops. But as with previous such claims after Russian attacks, he failed to provide any evidence that this was the case. Russia has made some slow but significant gains in the east of Ukraine since refocusing its invasion there. An official in the Russian-backed Luhansk People's Republic said on Friday that Russian troops have ""completely taken over"" an oil refinery in the embattled city of Lysychansk, eastern Ukraine, though Ukraine admitted only to a ""partial"" Russian success. The Russian barrage on Lysychansk has been relentless, according to Serhii Hayday, head of the Luhansk region military administration.

DTEK Group, which owns coal and thermal power plants in various parts of Ukraine, said the goal of the hack was to ""destabilize the technological processes"" of its distribution and generation firms, spread propaganda about the company's operations, and ""to leave Ukrainian consumers without electricity."" ""The cyberattacks didn't have any negative effect on DTEK's operations so far,"" DTEK spokesperson Antonina Antosha told CNN in an email Tuesday. ""All systems operate in a regular mode."" The hacking incident was disclosed days after Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man and DTEK's owner, sued Russia at the European Court of Human Rights for allegedly costing Akhmetov billions of dollars in property rights damages. A Russian-speaking hacking group known as XakNet claimed to have breached DTEK's networks this week and posted screenshots on the Telegram app of purported DTEK data as proof. The hacking group surfaced in March, according to a US and allied government advisory, and has claimed to target Ukrainian officials in support of Russia's war. XakNet has had access to data belonging to an organization that was likely hacked by a Russian cyber espionage group, suggesting a possible link between XakNet and the Russian government, said Alden Wahlstrom a senior analyst at US cybersecurity firm Mandiant, which has investigated some of XakNet's activity. On its Telegram channel, XakNet has mocked and denied the suggestion that it works with the Russian government. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington. The hacking incident coincided with Russian shelling this week of a DTEK-owned thermal power plant in Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, according to DTEK, whose websites says it employs 56,000 people. Microsoft in an April report made the case that Russian hacking has sometimes been used in tandem with kinetic military strikes. A cyberattack hit a Ukrainian broadcast company on March 1, the same day as a Russian missile strike against a TV tower in Kyiv, the report said. Ukrainian energy providers have consistently been the target of Russian hacking teams since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The Justice Department blamed Russia's military intelligence service for cyberattacks on electric utilities in 2015 and 2016 that cut power in parts of Ukraine. The same Russian hacking group in April allegedly targeted electric equipment in an area serving 2 million people in Ukraine, but Ukrainian officials claimed the hack was thwarted.

2022-06-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/politics/pentagon-technology-ukraine-usa/index.html,Pentagon reviewing industry proposals for innovative weapons ideas to send to Ukraine,"The Defense Department is reviewing 1,300 proposals from 800 companies for innovative new weapons and commercial capabilities they may be able to develop and produce for Ukraine to use in its fight against Russia's invasion of the country, a defense official told CNN on Thursday. The Pentagon hopes to make decisions on which proposals it wants to pursue in the coming weeks -- and which ones could potentially be used in the future by the US military. The proposals, requested by the department, center around key areas, including weapons capabilities for air defense, anti-armor, anti-personnel, coastal defense, anti-tank, unmanned aerial systems, counter battery and secure communications that have been identified by the Ukrainians as key military needs. They were sought as part of a broad initiative by the Defense Department to ""fulfill Ukraine's priority security assistance requests,"" according to the original solicitation for ideas sent to industry. The goal is to get ideas and information in hand to speed up production and build more capacity across the industrial base since it's now widely viewed that the US and its allies are likely to be supporting Ukraine long after their own existing weapons stockpiles run out. This comes as the Pentagon continues its weapons transfers that have amounted to billions of dollars. On Thursday, President Joe Biden said the US will soon announce another $800 million in new aid, including air defense systems and offensive weapons. So far, the US has committed $6.1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the February 24 invasion of the country by Russia. The US has been working with more than 50 other nations to see what weapons they can offer. The preference has been for those nations to provide Russian-made weapons in their arsenals because Ukraine's forces are familiar with those systems and would not need training. But as the war has gone on, more advanced weapons have been provided, and Ukrainian forces have been trained on Western weapons systems in nearby countries The Defense Department plan for potential new production contracts reflects the urgency of the military situation, as it looks for potential deliveries anywhere from less than 30 days to more than six months. The department is also asking that companies detail what type of air, land or sea platform their weapon might be deployed on, and if they already have something in production. ""In particular, the Department is exploring options which would accelerate production and build more capacity across the industrial base for weapons and equipment that can be rapidly exported, deployed with minimal training, and that are proven effective in the battlefield,"" the Defense Department said in its solicitation to industry for ideas. The effort comes as a follow-up to a Pentagon meeting earlier this year with eight of the largest defense contractors, as well as approval by Congress for purchasing contracts for weapons in addition to the ongoing drawdown and transfer of systems from the US military stockpile. The Pentagon has put in place a detailed bureaucratic structure to assess Ukraine's needs and to try to accelerate supplying them. A new ""senior Integration group"" of senior official reviews Ukraine's latest operational needs. The funding could potentially come from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is a pot of nearly $1 billion for contracting for weapons for Ukraine. Nearly $240 million has been contracted for in areas ranging from the Switchblade drone to secure communications devices.",49,5.796607998588302,2.975263464353907,2.821344534234395,8

Advisers to President Joe Biden have begun debating internally how and whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should shift his definition of a Ukrainian ""victory"" -- adjusting for the possibility that his country has shrunk irreversibly. US officials emphasized to CNN that this more pessimistic assessment does not mean the US plans to pressure Ukraine into making any formal territorial concessions to Russia in order to end the war. There is also hope that Ukrainian forces will be able to take back significant chunks of territory in a likely counteroffensive later this year. A congressional aide familiar with the deliberations told CNN that a smaller Ukrainian state is not inevitable. ""Whether Ukraine can take back these territories is in large part, if not entirely, a function of how much support we give them,"" the aide said. He noted that Ukraine has formally asked the US for a minimum of 48 multiple launch rocket systems, but to date has only been promised eight from the Pentagon. And not everyone in the administration is as worried -- some believe Ukrainian forces could again defy expectations, as they did in the early days of the war when they repelled a Russian advance on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. National security adviser Jake Sullivan has remained highly engaged with his Ukrainian counterparts and spent hours on the phone last week discussing Ukrainian efforts to recapture territory with Ukraine's defense chief and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, officials familiar with the call told CNN. The growing pessimism comes as Biden is meeting with US allies in Europe, where he will try to convey strength and optimism about the trajectory of the war as he rallies leaders to stay committed to arming and supporting Ukraine amid the brutal fight. ""We have to stay together. Putin has been counting on from the beginning, that somehow NATO and the G7 would splinter, but we haven't and we're not going to,"" Biden said Sunday while at the G7 summit in the Bavarian Alps. The administration announced another $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine last week, including additional rocket launch systems, artillery ammunition and patrol boats. The US is also expected to announce as soon as this week that it has purchased an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, called a NASAMS, for Ukrainian forces. Biden indicated in an op-ed earlier this month that he is committed to helping Ukraine gain the upper hand on the battlefield so that it has leverage in negotiations with Russia. The mood has shifted over the last several weeks, though, as Ukraine has struggled to repel Russia's advances in the Donbas and has suffered staggering troop losses, reaching as many as 100 soldiers per day. Ukrainian forces are also burning through their equipment and ammunition faster than the West can provide and train them on new, NATO-standard weapons systems. A US military official and a source familiar with Western intelligence agreed it was unlikely that Ukraine would be able to mass the force necessary to reclaim all of the territory lost to Russia during the fighting -- especially this year, as Zelensky said on Monday was his goal. A substantial counteroffensive might be possible with more weapons and training, the sources said, but Russia may also have an opportunity to replenish its force in that time, so there are no guarantees. ""Much hinges on whether Ukraine can retake territory at least to February 23 lines,"" said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at the Center for Naval Analyses. ""The prospect is there, but it's contingent. If Ukraine can get that far, then it can likely take the rest. But if it can't, then it may have to reconsider how best to attain victory."" Russian forces gaining ground Russian forces now control more than half of the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk region military administration, said Thursday. Ukrainian forces retreated from the key eastern city of Severodonetsk on Friday after weeks of bloody battle. Russian forces last week also captured ground around Lysychansk, the last city in the eastern Luhansk region still controlled by Ukraine. Ukrainian military commanders are now grappling with the reality that they may have to withdraw from the area to defend territory further west. In the meantime, Russian oil revenues have only been going up as oil prices have skyrocketed, even amid the harsh sanctions imposed by the West. US officials said on Monday that the US and its allies are going to try capping the price of oil so Russia does not profit from it anymore, but how and when that cap will take effect remains to be seen. Internally, there is a sense among some in the Biden administration that Zelensky will need to start moderating expectations for what Ukrainian forces can realistically achieve. Zelensky said late last month that he would ""consider it a victory for our state, as of today, to advance to the February 24 line without unnecessary losses."" He reiterated that goal last week. ""We don't have any other choice left but to move forward -- move to liberate all of our territories,"" he said in a Telegram post. ""We need to kick the invaders out of the Ukrainian regions. Though the width of the frontlines is as long as over 2,5000 km, we feel that we hold the strategic initiative."" And on Monday, he put a timeline on it: He wants the war over, and for Ukraine to win, by the end of 2022, he told G7 leaders. Russia is suffering acute combat losses as well, losing as much as a third of its ground force in four months of war, US intelligence officials estimate. Officials have also said publicly that Russia will struggle to make any serious gains further west, using the Donbas region as a staging ground, without a full mobilization of its reserve forces. But Russia believes it can maintain the fight, wearing down Ukrainian and western resolve as the global economic effects of the war become more severe, officials have told CNN. The hunt for Soviet-era weaponry As CNN has previously reported, Russia is looking in particular to exploit the gap between how much Soviet-style ammunition Ukraine and its allies have in their stockpiles, and how long it will take the west to provide Ukraine with modern, NATO-standard weapons and munitions that require time-consuming training. A senior defense official acknowledged to CNN that the Soviet-era stocks are ""dwindling,"" but haven't yet reached ""rock bottom."" The official said that some eastern European countries still have more they could provide -- but only if they continue to be backfilled by allies with more modern equipment. The US and its allies, meanwhile, have been scrounging the world for the kind of Soviet-era ammunition that fits the equipment Ukraine already has, including 152 mm artillery ammunition. NATO-standard weapons fire larger, 155mm rounds. But another US defense official told CNN that effort is effectively reaching its end, with almost everything available that countries are willing to provide having already gone in. Given the prodigious rate at which the Ukrainians have gone through their older ammunition in the bruising artillery fight in the Donbas, the official said, ""Soviet-era weapons are being wiped off the earth.""",7,4.686640434648785,4.205373176471412,0.4812672581773727,13

A Russian-speaking hacking group, known as Killnet, claimed responsibility for at least some of the hacks, saying they were in retaliation for Lithuania blocking the shipment of some goods to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, which is wedged between Lithuania and Poland. Monday's cyberattacks were aimed in part at Lithuania's Secure Data Transfer Network, a communications network for government officials that is built to withstand war and other crises, according to the defense ministry. ""Part of the Secure National Data Transfer Network users have been unable to access services, work is in progress to restore it to normal,"" Lithuania's National Cyber Security Centre (NKSC) said in a statement issued by the defense ministry. ""It is highly probable that such, or even more, intense attacks will continue into the coming days, especially against the communications, energy and financial sectors,"" acting NKSC Director Jonas Skardinskas said in a statement. The type of hack in question is known as a distributed denial of service attack, which floods websites with phony traffic to knock them offline. It's a common tool favored by ""hacktivists"" like Killnet -- suspected non-state actors who conduct cyberattacks for political causes. Since Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February, a bevy of pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian hacking groups have caused disruptions to an array of organizations in Ukraine and Russia. A group known as the Belarusian Cyber-Partisans, for example, has claimed hacks on the IT systems that support trains moving Russian soldiers near the front lines in Ukraine. Lithuania is a member of NATO, the 30-country alliance that includes the US, which has been on guard for pro-Russian hacks for months. CNN has requested comment from NATO on Monday's hacking incidents.",20,7.798985231155688,8.833085448139535,-1.0341002169838465,2

At least 18 people were killed, Dmytro Lunin, the head of the Poltava region military administration, said on Tuesday. He had earlier said the death toll could rise. ""Another 36 people are missing,"" he said, adding that more than 1,000 people -- including rescuers, police, medics and volunteers -- worked through the night. ""We continue the search."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said after the strike that up to 1,000 people were in the mall before the air raid was announced. ""Fortunately, as far as we know, at that time, many people managed to get out, they managed to get out, but there were still people inside -- workers and some visitors,"" he said. At least 58 people were injured, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Services, while Lunin said 25 people were admitted to intensive care at the hospital in Kremenchuk. Video from the scene showed heavy smoke billowing from the building, which was engulfed by fire. The mall measures about one hectare -- roughly the size of two football fields -- and the strike occurred around 4 p.m. local time, according to Volodymyr Solohub, a regional official in the Poltava Oblast local administration. ""We don't know how many more people might be under the rubble,"" Solohub said. Zelensky called the strike ""one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history,"" in his evening video address. ""A peaceful city, an ordinary shopping mall with women inside, children, ordinary civilians inside,"" he said. ""Only totally insane terrorists, who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object. And this is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike -- exactly at this shopping mall."" The attack targeted a site in central Ukraine far away from the epicenter of Russia's war, which has recently been focused in the east of the country. Ukrainian officials said the attack was conducted by a Russian KH-22 missile, which is capable of carrying an explosive warhead of up to 1 ton (2,240 pounds). It came as G7 leaders met at a summit in Germany that was mostly geared toward coordinating the Western response to Russia's invasion. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said from that meeting that the attack showed the ""depths of cruelty and barbarism"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the UK's PA news agency reported. ""This appalling attack has shown once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink,"" Johnson said, according to PA. In a tweet Monday, US President Joe Biden condemned the attack, saying, ""Russia's attack on civilians at a shopping mall is cruel. We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people."" ""As demonstrated at the G7 Summit, the U.S. along with our allies and partners will continue to hold Russia accountable for such atrocities and support Ukraine's defense,"" Biden added. French President Emmanuel Macron called the attack an ""abomination,"" in a tweet that included video of the burning shopping mall. ""The Russian people have to see the truth,"" he said. And Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmitro Kuleba, said on Twitter: ""Russia is a disgrace to humanity and it must face consequences. The response should be more heavy arms for Ukraine, more sanctions on Russia, and more businesses leaving Russia."" Those issues were on the table at the summit in Germany. The G7 vowed to continue providing support for Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"" in a joint statement, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told CNN on Monday that she would not ""bet on Russia"" winning the war. The US plans to announce as early as this week that it has bought an advanced, medium-to-long-range surface-to-air missile defense system for Ukraine, a source familiar with the announcement told CNN. However despite the outward confidence of Western leaders, Russia has seen military successes in eastern Ukraine in recent days. Russian forces captured the city of Severodonetsk after weeks of fighting and have also picked up territory south of Lysychansk. They have eliminated most Ukrainian defenses in the Luhansk region and consolidated control of a belt of territory in the south, bringing strategic benefits and blunting the effectiveness of Ukrainian counterattacks. Russian forces have also stepped up attacks in the Donetsk region, getting slightly closer to the belt of industrial towns in the region that runs south from Sloviansk through Kramatorsk to Kostiantynivka. ""Zelensky was very much focused on trying to ensure that Ukraine is in as advantageous a position on the battlefield as possible in the next months as opposed to the next years, because he believes that a grinding conflict is not in the interest of the Ukrainian people,"" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said after the Ukrainian President met virtually with leaders at the G7. Earlier, a source familiar with the matter told CNN that Zelensky told leaders he wanted the war to be over by the end of the year, before winter sets in.",47,4.564124616749111,3.6336244651464114,0.9305001516026996,25
2022-06-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/europe/russia-ukraine-war-tide-turning-lister-intl-hnk/index.html,Tide turns in the Ukraine war as Russia makes progress in the east,"Russian forces are arguably having their best spell since the invasion of Ukraine began four months ago. They have eliminated most Ukrainian defenses in the Luhansk region, consolidated control of a belt of territory in the south, improved their logistics and command structure and blunted the effectiveness of Ukrainian attack drones. Within the last week, the Russians have been rewarded for their intense -- some would say merciless -- bombardments of the remaining parts of the Luhansk region held by Ukrainian forces, which have finally given up Severodonetsk and lost territory south of Lysychansk. The head of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic, Leonid Pasechnik, predicted last Friday that Russian forces would completely encircle Lysychansk within two or three days. So far they haven't, but the city is in imminent peril. Russian forces have also stepped up attacks in the Donetsk region, getting slightly closer to the belt of industrial towns in the region that runs south from Sloviansk through Kramatorsk to Kostiantynivka. In Lysychansk and many of the towns studded across the meandering front lines that pass through five regions, the Ukrainians may well face a repeat of what happened in Severodonetsk, where they were bombarded into withdrawing. There was simply nothing left that could be defended. The immediate dilemma for the Ukrainian military is whether it remains committed to defending Lysychansk, with the risk of losing troops and weapons if the city is encircled -- and whether Ukraine's political leadership will order a withdrawal to new defensive lines. If so, can the units now in the pocket of territory held by Ukraine retreat without being decimated? Large sections of the highway from Lysychansk to Bakhmut are littered with wreckage, and Russian units are edging closer to Bakhmut itself. It appears the Russians are not currently making much progress from Izium in the north towards Sloviansk, despite repeated attempts to break through Ukrainian lines. Even so, Ukrainian officials cautioned Sunday that Russian forces were ""accumulating"" north of Sloviansk. The Russian military can quickly mobilize a handful of battalion tactical groups sitting across the border. Some Russian military bloggers are not getting carried away with optimism. Yuri Kotyenok, for one, believes that Russian forces do not have enough manpower to encircle the heavily fortified cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. In the longer run, the Ukrainians' best hope is that as they deploy more Western weaponry capable of destroying Russian artillery, rocket systems and command posts far behind the front lines, they can gradually reduce the deficit in firepower. But weapons such as the HIMARS rocket system, which has a range of 70 kilometers (43 miles) in the configuration supplied to Ukraine, require several weeks of training. And in Donbas, several weeks is a long time given the current pressure on Ukrainian forces. That pressure is all the greater because many of the units deployed to the region are among the most experienced that Ukraine has. They have been worn down by the sheer intensity of Russian bombardment and are not easily replaced. And the Ukrainian military has already lost in combat some of the weapons rushed to the front. Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed last week that Russian strikes had already eliminated some of the US-supplied M777 howitzers. The Russian offensive has also learned from mistakes made during the initial and abortive drive towards Kyiv. Air defenses, principally the S-300, have been deployed to provide extensive rather than local cover, making Ukrainian attack drones less effective. Anecdotally, it seems fewer videos have been posted recently on social media showing Ukrainian combat planes in action. Russia appoints new commanders The Russian hierarchy has also been reorganized, with new commanders for the southern and central forces committed to Ukraine under the overall leadership of Deputy Defense Minister Gennady Zhidko. The Institute for the Study of War said the ""Russian high command is reshuffling and restructuring military command in order to better organize operations in Ukraine."" It's perhaps no accident that the first reported visit of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and senior commanders to forces involved in the ""special military operation"" came as the tide seemed to flow in Russia's favor. Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan. Rob Lee, an analyst of the Russian military at King's College London, noted that Zhidko sat next to Shoigu at meetings during his visit. Lee recalled that Russia apparently ""had no overall commander in the initial phase (in March), violating the unity of command principle."" The great unknown is whether Russian success in rolling up Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk might encourage a further expansion of its war aims beyond the special military operation -- perhaps an effort to sustain the momentum as far as the Dnipro river, which essentially divides Ukraine into two. That is the worst-case scenario for the Ukrainians and for now it remains a distant possibility rather than an imminent risk. Ukrainian forces are still defending some 12,000 square kilometers (4,600 square miles) of Donetsk alone (an area the size of Connecticut.) Despite Ukrainian reverses in recent weeks, there is still plenty of evidence that Russian armor is also suffering a high rate of attrition. Western officials believe some battalion tactical groups have been reconstituted. And there may be a silver lining for Ukraine in its battlefield reverses: they make the case for an accelerated weapons pipeline from the West just as the G7 leaders meet. One of President Zelensky's most committed backers, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, is aware of the risk of ""Ukraine fatigue"" as the battlefield appears to turn in Russia's favor. ""The first few weeks and months of the Ukrainian resistance have been characterized by overwhelming global unity and a huge surge of support for the Ukrainian people,"" he said as the G7 got underway in Germany. ""It is essential that this is sustained for the long term. Russia's behavior and the atrocities Putin is committing must not become normalized in the eyes of the world."" US President Joe Biden issued a similar appeal. ""We have to stay together. Putin has been counting on from the beginning that somehow NATO and the G7 would splinter, but we haven't and we're not going to,"" he said. There is -- for now -- no sign that either side is going to blink, not least because so much is at stake. Hal Brands, writing in Foreign Affairs, said the conflict ""has both highlighted and deepened the fundamental global cleavage today -- the clash between advanced democracies that are committed to the existing international order and the Eurasian autocracies trying to overturn it."" But for Putin, this war of choice is an installment (a big one) of an existential struggle against US hegemony. The Institute for the Study of War concluded that the Kremlin ""intends to conduct a protracted conflict in Ukraine and is seeking to advance mobilization efforts to support long-term military and political goals in occupied areas of Ukraine.""",7,3.8909118837851873,4.335855097312251,-0.4449432135270639,13

President Joe Biden, who is currently meeting with G7 leaders in Germany for a summit primarily focused on Ukraine, announced recently that the US would provide Ukraine with ""more advanced rocket systems and munitions"" as its war with Russia grinds on. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is slated to virtually address Biden and other G7 leaders on Monday. In response to requests by Ukrainian forces, other military assistance is also likely to be announced this week, including additional artillery ammunition and counter-battery radars. Ukrainian officials have asked for the missile defense system, known as a NASAMS system, given the weapons can hit targets more than 100 miles away, though the Ukrainian forces will likely need to be trained on the systems, a source said. The NASMAS system the same one that protects Washington, DC, and the area around the nation's capital. The US has been steadily announcing additional security assistance for Ukraine. Last week, the Biden administration announced an additional $450 million in military assistance for Ukraine, giving it four more multiple launch rocket systems and artillery ammunition for other systems. And earlier this month, the Biden administration said it was providing an additional $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine, a package that includes shipments of additional howitzers, ammunition and coastal defense systems. CNN reported last week that US assessments of the war increasingly envision a long and punishing battle in the eastern part of Ukraine, with high personnel and equipment losses on both sides. US officials believe that Russian forces plan to maintain intense attacks in the east, characterized by heavy artillery and missile strikes, with the intention of wearing down Ukrainian forces and NATO resolve over time. For Ukraine's part, its military has been burning through Soviet-era ammunition that fits older systems, and Western governments have been facing a tough decision on whether they want to continue increasing their assistance to the country, something Biden has already pledged to do. ""We will continue to lead the world in providing historic assistance to support Ukraine's fight for freedom,"" the President wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month.",49,6.00763957749386,4.243139165344353,1.7645004121495074,8

Putin told Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko at a meeting in St. Petersburg the missile systems ""can use both ballistic and cruise missiles, both in conventional and nuclear versions,"" according to the Kremlin. Russia launched its February 24 invasion in part from Belarusian territory, which borders Ukraine to the north. Throughout the war, Moscow has used Minsk as a satellite base including for many of Russia's air operations in Ukraine, according to intelligence collected by NATO surveillance planes. On Saturday, Ukraine claimed Russian forces had fired multiple missiles on the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions from Belarus. In a transcript of the meeting, Lukashenko expressed to Putin his ""stress"" over what he alleged are flights by United States and NATO planes ""training to carry nuclear warheads"" close to Belarus' border. He asked Putin to consider ""a mirrored response"" to the flights or to convert Russian fighter jets, which are currently deployed to Belarus, to ""carry nuclear warheads."" Putin replied that ""there is no need"" to match the US flights and suggested Belarus could modify its own Su-25 aircraft to be nuclear-capable instead. ""This modernization should be carried out at aircraft factories in Russia, but we will agree with you on how to do this. And accordingly, start training the flight crew,"" Putin said. What is the Iskander-M? The Iskander-M is a Russian-built short-range ballistic missile system that can carry conventional or nuclear warheads with a maximum range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles), according to Janes Defense. The weapon uses both optical and inertial guidance systems to strike its targets, hitting them with a range of warheads, such as cluster munitions, vacuum bombs, bunker-busters, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) warheads, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance. The Iskander-M was first used in 2008 during the Russia-Georgia conflict, when the Russian Army used it to hit targets in Gori, according to the Alliance. CNN has reached out the Pentagon for comment on Lukashenko's claims. G7 and NATO summits The meeting between the Russian and Belarusian strongmen came ahead of a week of summits in Europe, where the grinding war in Ukraine -- entering its fifth month -- will be front and center. The leaders of Japan, Canada, the US, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the European Union and host Germany will meet for the Group of 7 on Monday. US President Joe Biden hopes to announce new sanctions and military assistance alongside European allies during his visits to Germany and Spain. Both the G7 and NATO summits will hear from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who continues to appeal to the US and other countries for more help. During his nightly address on Saturday, Zelensky said, ""sanctions packages against Russia are not enough"" and called on the western partners to provide Ukraine with more ""armed assistance."" ""The air defense systems -- the modern systems that our partners have -- should be not in training areas or storage facilities, but in Ukraine, where they are now needed,"" he said. Meanwhile, Ukraine's military on Saturday confirmed it had started using an advanced Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) supplied by the US to strike Russian targets. Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi posted a video that he said showed the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, launching its missile at night at an unspecified location. CNN reported on Thursday that HIMARS had arrived in Ukraine, citing the country's Defense Ministry. Fall of Severodonetsk On Saturday, the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk was ""completely under Russian occupation,"" the city's head of military administration Oleksandr Striuk said, following months of grueling and bloody fighting. Severodonetsk was one of the last major Ukrainian strongholds in the area. Regional military officials said Friday that the last troops in Severodonetsk had been ordered to leave, as it was impossible to keep defending their positions. This effectively ceded the city to Russia and put the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk almost fully under Russian control. Russia's Ministry of Defense on Saturday said its forces have now taken control of the entire left-bank of the Siverskyi Donets, the eastern side of the river, and all the borders of the Luhansk People's Republic. Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, defense ministry spokesperson, said Russian forces have ""completely liberated the cities of Severodonetsk and Borivske, the settlements of Voronove and Syrotyne of the Luhansk People's Republic.""",49,3.2773860383027333,5.563007654396788,-2.285621616094055,21
2022-06-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/russian-spy-johns-hopkins-classmates-accent-suspicious/index.html,"Suspected Russian spy was well-liked by classmates, but something just seemed a little off","Victor Muller's accent just didn't sound right. The man now alleged to be a Russian spy was studying at the prestigious Johns Hopkins' School of Advanced International Studies, an elite graduate program favored by US military personnel, young diplomats and, sources say, future spies. Gregarious, smart, and often seen toting a helmet for his beloved motorcycle, ""Muller"" was known, and even liked, by his fellow students and the faculty at SAIS. But his muddled accent caught the ear of a few classmates. On one occasion, a fellow student asked him outright: Are you Russian? The spy brushed off the question. He was from Brazil, he said in what turned out to be part of the elaborate cover identity he spent years building. ""Looking back, it was a red flag,"" the former classmate told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""I remember thinking at the time it didn't really make sense."" ""Muller"" graduated from SAIS in 2020. Last week, a Dutch intelligence agency publicly identified him as Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, a Russian military intelligence officer who in April traveled to the Netherlands to start an internship at the International Criminal Court (ICC). From there, he would have had a perch to spy on war crimes investigations into Russian military actions in Ukraine and elsewhere, sources say. Dutch officials stopped him at the border and sent him back to Brazil, where he had been living under the forged identity of a Brazilian man whose parents are deceased, according to Brazilian police. It was not immediately clear when the US became aware of Cherkasov's true identity. The FBI has an active investigation open, according to one source familiar with the intelligence. US and Dutch intelligence agencies shared information about Cherkasov some time ago, according to a separate US official, though it's not clear when that occurred. Yet another US official wouldn't address how the Russian intelligence connection came to light, adding that the FBI worked closely with the Dutch authorities on tracking his activities. The revelation of Cherkasov's true identity has roiled faculty at SAIS. But to former intelligence officials, Cherkasov fits a well-known pattern: Russia, among other foreign powers, seeks to place young intelligence operatives in American academic institutions to help build their deep cover identities. Often, the mission of so-called ""illegals"" -- a spy operating under an identity not linked to the Russian government in any way -- is to do little more than simply establish legitimacy as a student, said John McLaughlin, a former deputy director of the CIA who now teaches at SAIS. ""It's not unusual,"" McLaughlin said. ""My sense is that passing through SAIS was a kind of laundering experience for him. These Russian illegals tend to go through a long process of credentialing themselves in order to establish credibility as who they claim to be."" SAIS declined to comment when reached by CNN on Friday. But in an email to faculty and students obtained by CNN, SAIS dean Jim Steinberg confirmed that Cherkasov graduated in 2020. ""We are continuing to monitor developments, but we have no further information to share at this time,"" Steinberg wrote. Cherkasov did not respond to a phone call or text message seeking comment on Friday. 'Teacher's favorite' Cherkasov appears to have carried out that mission quite successfully. One of Cherkasov's professors -- who taught a class on genocide -- wrote his reference letter for the internship at The Hague. In another SAIS class, ""he was the teacher's favorite,"" said another classmate, who like other former classmates spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation from the Russian security services. ""He was a very nice guy, very open-minded, very active in class."" ""This guy I would have never suspected [of being a spy],"" the former classmate told CNN. A third former classmate of Cherkasov, a US military officer, struck up a conversation one day with Muller about their shared love of motor bikes. Eventually he got the impression that he and Muller might go for a ride together, the military officer told CNN. But then, he asked Muller if he spoke Russian, since it sounded like he might based on his accent. Muller denied being able to speak Russian and became withdrawn, the military officer said. The motor bike ride never happened. Multiple former intelligence officials told CNN it would not be unusual for US counterintelligence officials to allow a Russian ""illegal"" to continue his studies in order to watch him and try to learn who his contacts are, whether he is operating in a larger network inside the United States, and how he is building his cover. It's possible the US tipped off the Dutch intelligence service, these people said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the case. But another former counterintelligence officer noted that US intelligence services sometimes aren't aware of student spies until they become more actively engaged in carrying out espionage -- and only then, do they trace their histories back to SAIS or other academic institutions in the United States with a foreign policy bent. 'Insider threat' Why the Kremlin would want to plant a spy in the International Criminal Court is clear, former intelligence officials say: It would offer Russia a crucial window into the investigation into alleged Russian war crimes -- in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine in 2022. ""For those reasons, covert access to International Criminal Court information would be highly valuable to the Russian intelligence services,"" Dutch intelligence said in its statement. Effectively planting a spy is increasingly difficult for intelligence services across the globe, thanks to ubiquitous surveillance technology and the degree to which most people live their entire lives online in 2022. An online profile that only popped up a few years ago, or a profile that suddenly goes inactive, can be a tip-off for counterintelligence officers trying to spot spies. The problem is equally difficult for American spies operating abroad under ""nonofficial cover,"" a so-called NOC. ""Any sort of durable long-term illegal is not a dying breed but far more difficult to do now than it once was,"" said one former US counterintelligence official. ""And that's true for everybody."" The US arrested and deported 10 Russian operatives as part of a spy swap with Moscow in 2010, one of whom had graduated from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government 10 years before and had been living in Cambridge with his wife and two children. Harvard subsequently stripped Andrey Bezrukov -- who went by the name Donald Heathfield -- of his degree. His wife, Elena Vavilova, graduated from McGill University and was deported as part of the same swap. Cherkasov had similarly sought to quietly build an alternate identity over the course of years. The Dutch intelligence agency published a crude ""legend"" that it says was probably written by Cherkasov in mid-2010, laying out his false history as a Brazilian man born in Rio de Janeiro in 1989. He details this fake family history through multiple generations, offering a myriad of small personal idiosyncrasies: a hatred for fish, a beloved aunt, a crush on a geography teacher. In 2014, Cherkasov began attending college at Trinity College Dublin, studying political science and graduating in 2018. The same year, he traveled to the United States to obtain his master's degree at SAIS. Unanswered questions Throughout his time as a student, Muller maintained an active digital life. In 2017, he started a blog on geopolitics, according to the open-source intelligence company Bellingcat. He maintained a Facebook and a Twitter account, full of friends from both schools and, in September 2018, published a YouTube video introducing his new motorcycle. In the video, a man whom Bellingcat identifies as Cherkasov can be heard chuckling and greeting at a trolley of tourists riding near the Potomac River. Although it's not clear how far back Russian intelligence plotted to place Cherkasov at The Hague -- some former intelligence officials said it might have been opportunistic rather than a long-running plan -- Cherkasov did take classes that made sense for a student interested in The Hague as a career path, including a class on genocide. A policy memo that Cherkasov wrote for one of his SAIS classes exhibits the sober and anecdote-rich analysis one might expect from a student of international affairs. The memo, obtained by CNN, advocates potential US responses at the United Nations to help stop a genocide. It's the sort of US policy discussion that has in recent months applied to trying to curtail Russian violence in Ukraine. And according to multiple people familiar with him while at SAIS, Cherkasov was a good student -- smart, engaged and talkative in class. One class that Muller either enrolled in or audited was on strategic diplomacy, popular with US military and intelligence professionals, and taught by Steinberg, a former deputy secretary of State in the Obama administration and current dean of SAIS, according to one of the former SAIS students. SAIS faculty and students have been left stunned by the revelation that the Brazilian student with the funny accent was, in fact, a Russian spy. SAIS faculty who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity say that the school's communication to them has been bare bones, little more than an acknowledgment of the public reporting. ""It's off-putting,"" said the former SAIS student who pressed Cherkasov on his accent. ""For me, it raises a lot of questions about how he was admitted to SAIS, how he was able to travel.""",20,6.065903171145875,6.687593781687185,-0.62169061054131,29
2022-06-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/russian-forces-advantage-eastern-ukraine-war-intelligence/index.html,"Russia is gaining advantage in eastern Ukraine as forces learn from earlier mistakes, US officials say","Russian forces are gaining an advantage in eastern Ukraine as they learn from mistakes made during the earlier stages of their invasion of the country, including better coordinating air and ground attacks and improving logistics and supply lines, two US officials with direct knowledge of US intelligence assessments told CNN. The US does not expect new weapons systems recently supplied to Ukrainian forces, including the HIMARS multiple rocket launch system, to immediately change the situation on the battlefield in part because those systems are so far being sent with both a limited range and a limited number of rockets to ensure they are not fired into Russian territory. Additionally, Russian forces have been able to destroy some of the new Western-supplied weapons, including M777 howitzers, in targeted attacks. The US assessments, which increasingly envision a long and punishing battle in eastern Ukraine, come as the months-long war there has reached a pivotal moment in recent days. Ukraine's military has been burning through Soviet-era ammunition that fits older systems, and Western governments are facing a tough decision on whether they want to continue increasing their assistance to the country. The US assessments paint a dismal image of the future of the war, with high personnel and equipment losses on both sides. US officials believe that Russian forces plan to maintain intense attacks in the east, characterized by heavy artillery and missile strikes, with the intention of wearing down Ukrainian forces and NATO resolve over time. Russia's advancements were brought into plain view in recent days after Ukraine's defense of Lysychansk -- the last city in the Luhansk region it still holds -- became a lot more tenuous. In the last couple of days, Russians have advanced into several villages south of Lysychansk, though not without sustaining losses from Ukrainian artillery fire. In the coming weeks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will virtually address the upcoming G7 and NATO summits, senior US administration officials have said, with the leader looking to shore up Western support for his country. During the G7, President Joe Biden will unveil steps alongside other leaders to increase pressure on Russia for its invasion. And at NATO, the US will announce measures to ""strengthen European security, alongside expected major new contributions from allies,"" one official said. Members of the Ukrainian parliament have told US lawmakers that the Russian military has calculated how much ammunition Western allies have in stockpiles for the Ukrainian military's mostly Russian-made artillery -- and plan to wait for Ukrainian forces to run out over time. ""Putin is not deterred and I don't think he will ever be deterred,"" Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN. ""This war could last years,"" he added. At home, US and NATO partners are beginning to see the limits of their own supplies of certain advanced weapons, including shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles. These weapons systems have their own complicated supply lines, meaning it could take years to replace the thousands of such missiles already supplied to Ukrainian forces. Meanwhile, the US Defense Department's watchdog has opened an evaluation of the department's plans to restock its own munitions and equipment stockpiles as it continues to supply significant quantities to Ukraine, the agency announced Wednesday. ""The objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the DOD has planned to restock its equipment and munitions provided to Ukraine,"" the department's inspector general said in a statement.",49,4.622709114203288,2.887264190890142,1.7354449233131461,8

The package, which will be drawn from existing Defense Department stocks, also includes 18 patrol boats for monitoring coasts and rivers, and small arms. The most significant part of the package is the four additional High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, wheeled vehicles capable of launching barrages of guided rockets at targets up to approximately 40 miles away. The US approved the first four rocket systems at the beginning of the month. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced Thursday on Twitter that they had entered the country. Training for 60 Ukrainian soldiers on the systems concluded last week. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has approved more than $6 billion in security assistance. John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's coordinator for strategic communications, said the additional security assistance serves ""as part of our effort to help Ukraine defend its democracy in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression."" Kirby added that with the latest announcement, the total amount of security assistance the US has sent to Ukraine comes to approximately $6.1 billion since February 24 and $6.8 billion since President Joe Biden took office. The new aid comes as Russia's months-long invasion of Ukraine has reached a pivotal moment in recent days. Ukraine's military has been burning through Soviet-era ammunition that fits older systems, and Western governments face a tough decision on whether they want to continue increasing their assistance to the country. Last week, the Biden administration announced it was providing an additional $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine to fight Russia, a package that includes shipments of additional howitzers, ammunition and coastal defense systems. CNN reported earlier Thursday that US assessments of the war increasingly envision a long and punishing battle in the eastern part of Ukraine, with high personnel and equipment losses on both sides. US officials believe that Russian forces plan to maintain intense attacks in the east, characterized by heavy artillery and missile strikes, with the intention of wearing down Ukrainian forces and NATO resolve over time.

2022-06-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/politics/microsoft-russia-hackings/index.html,Microsoft says Russia has stepped up cyber espionage against the US and Ukraine allies,"Russian intelligence agencies have increased their efforts to hack US and allied government computer networks to gather intelligence since the war in Ukraine began, Microsoft said in new findings published Wednesday. American organizations were the top target of the Russian hacking attempts outside of Ukraine, according to Microsoft, but the alleged Russian hacking has spanned 42 countries, and a range of sectors that might have valuable information related to the war, from governments to think tanks to humanitarian groups. It's a reminder of the voracious appetite that Russian cyber operatives have for strategic information as the Kremlin is more isolated on the international stage than it has been for decades. Those hacking attempts have successfully penetrated defenses 29% of the time, according to Microsoft. Of those successful breaches, a quarter resulted in data stolen from networks. But measuring the ""success"" of a Russian cyber-espionage is difficult, and Microsoft said it didn't have a full view of the hacking because some customers stored data on their own systems rather than in Microsoft's cloud computing infrastructure. CNN has reached out to the Russian Embassy in Washington for comment. Moscow routinely denies hacking accusations. Various governments have likely stepped up their offensive cyber activities related to the Ukraine war as they search for insights on the fighting and the global fallout from it. Cyber Command, the US military's hacking unit, has conducted a ""full spectrum"" of offensive, defensive and information operations in support of Ukraine, the head of the command confirmed this month. China, too, has trained some of its very capable hackers on targets related to the Ukraine war, according to cybersecurity researchers. Suspected Chinese hackers appeared to try to break into computers linked to officials in the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk, near the Chinese border, according to cybersecurity firm Secureworks. US officials continue to study Russia's efforts to supplement its kinetic war in Ukraine with cyber operations. Significant alleged Russian hacking incidents in Ukraine since the February invasion include a hack of a satellite operator, which knocked out internet service for tens of thousands of satellite modems as the invasion unfolded, and waves of data-wiping hacks aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian government agencies. Ukrainian officials have also accused the Russians of routing internet traffic in occupied parts of Ukraine through Russian internet providers and subjecting those connections to censorship. Some of those tactics ""may form parts of China's playbook"" in future attempts by Beijing to project power beyond its borders, according to Mieke Eoyang, deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy. ""The cyber dimensions of [what Russia is trying doing in Ukraine] are incredibly important to us, especially in the Defense Department, to understand what the playbook might be if another cyber-capable country were to attempt to do this,"" Eoyang said Tuesday at an event in Washington hosted by the think tank Third Way. NATO members a focus for Russian hackers NATO, the 30-country military alliance that includes the US, Canada and European allies, has been a particular target for Russia's computer operatives, according to the Microsoft report. After the US, Poland -- a hub for delivering humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine -- was the NATO member targeted the most by Russian hackers in recent months, Microsoft researchers found. Prospective, and not just current, NATO members have had to keep their guard up for potential Russian cyberattacks. The governments of Sweden and Finland have been vigilant for Russian hacking before and after they announced their intention to join NATO in May. Swedish officials for months have encouraged critical infrastructure operators to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious cyber activity to authorities, said Johan Turell, a senior analyst in the cybersecurity department of the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, a government organization that prepares for natural and man-made crises. The Kremlin has warned Sweden and Finland, which shares hundreds of miles of border with Russia, against joining NATO. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by video conference with the Finnish parliament on April 8, a cyberattack briefly knocked offline the websites of Finland's ministries of foreign affairs and defense. The websites quickly came back online. Some digital forensics specialists linked the hack, which did not cause any serious disruption, to Russia. ""We don't know if this was Russian patriotic hackers or an entity linked more directly to [the] Russian government,"" Mikko Hyppönen, a prominent Finnish cybersecurity executive, told CNN. ""But I have no doubt that the attack was Russian,"" he said after reviewing the technical evidence. ""If Russia is trying to scare us with these attacks, they are failing,"" said Hyppönen, who is chief research officer at cybersecurity firm WithSecure.

Levin, a Ukrainian photojournalist who worked with a number of major Western news outlets including Reuters and the BBC disappeared on March 13 while covering Russia's assault on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. His body was discovered on April 1. RSF said it sent two investigators two Ukraine from May 24 to June 3 and that they concluded Levin, and a friend he was with, ""were executed in cold blood."" ""The evidence against the Russian forces is overwhelming,"" the NGO said in a summary. The organization said it found several bullets and cartridge casings at the scene, the identity papers of the friend and soldier that was accompanying Levin, and identified 14 bullet impacts in the car they were traveling in. RSF said it also found several items with possible DNA evidence, attesting to the presence of Russian soldiers in the vicinity of the crime scene and, crucially, located a bullet right next to the spot where Levin's body was found. ""Analysis of the photos of the crime scene, the observations made on the spot and the material evidence recovered clearly point to an execution that may have been preceded by interrogation or even acts of torture,"" RSF Secretary General Christophe Delore said of the report. ""In the context of a war heavily marked by propaganda and Kremlin censorship, Maks Levin and his friend paid with their lives for their fight for reliable information."" RSF said it submitted its findings as well as all the evidence to the Ukraine Attorney General's office. On April 2, the Ukraine Attorney General's office said the journalist's body had been found in the Vyshgorod district, just north of Kyiv, adding that ""soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces killed the unarmed Maksym Levin with two gunshots."" Russia has consistently denied targeting civilians, including journalists, since it began its invasion of Ukraine, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. CNN was unable to independently verify RSF's findings. Levin began working as a photojournalist in 2006, according to his bio on LensCulture, a photography resources website.

2022-06-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/europe/russia-ukraine-severodonetsk-cmd-intl/index.html,"Two months on, Russia is still struggling to capture this small Ukrainian city","It's been nearly two months since Russian forces began their assault on the city of Severodonetsk. But despite overwhelming firepower, they still can't dislodge determined Ukrainian resistance -- nor cut the supply lines that provide the city's remaining defenders with a drip-feed of weapons and ammunition. The fierce Ukrainian defense of Severodonetsk, despite heavy losses, has forced the Russians to concentrate firepower on a relatively small area and held up their efforts to seize the 10% of Luhansk region they still do not control. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the seizure of Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions as one of the objectives of Moscow's special military operation that began in February. For now, that operation is largely stalled; a large part of Donetsk remains beyond the Russians' reach. Russian forces are making modest gains -- the Russian Defense Ministry said Sunday that the town of Metelkino just southeast of Severodonetsk had been taken. But the Russians' goal of encircling the Ukrainian troops defending the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk still appears some way off. In a campaign lacking agility and imagination, the Russians have resorted to one principal tactic: overwhelming indirect fire against any and all Ukrainian positions, regardless of the collateral destruction. The aim is to leave nothing standing that can be defended. The use of troops on the ground to take and hold urban areas has been less frequent and less successful. In a video of Ukrainian special forces in the area released at the weekend, one unidentified Ukrainian soldier says: ""They are throwing everything they have, all the munitions they have. It doesn't matter for them if it's our positions or civilian areas, they wipe everything from the face of earth and then they use artillery and then they start moving forward little by little."" Amid intense urban combat, some 500 civilians, including dozens of children, have taken shelter in the Azot chemical plant in Severodonetsk. Unlike the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, it offers little protection below ground. Ukrainian officials say people there, who previously refused to leave, do have food supplies but can no longer be evacuated from the plant because of the intense fighting. But as with Azovstal, the Azot plant and its immediate surroundings have become the focal point of Ukrainian resistance -- frustrating Russian commanders. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank in Washington, ""Russian troops are likely facing mounting losses and troop and equipment degradation that will complicate attempts to renew offensive operations on other critical locations as the slow battle for Severodonetsk continues."" Just as the defense of Mariupol drew in more than a dozen battalion tactical groups, so overcoming resistance in Severodonetsk is proving labor-intensive. Grinding down resistance The Ukrainians claim to have inflicted heavy losses on Russian forces in the area -- in part thanks to new equipment from Western allies, including anti-tank weapons and longer-range howitzers supplied by the United States and France. On Saturday, the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that units of Russia's 11th Separate Motorized Rifle Regiment had suffered significant losses and were ""withdrawn from the area of combat operations to restore combat capability."" However, Ukrainian supply lines are under constant attack, and it has become more difficult to ferry supplies from further west in Donetsk region along the highway to Lysychansk. The ISW still expects that ""Russian forces will likely be able to seize Severodonetsk in the coming weeks, but at the cost of concentrating most of their available forces in this small area."" The Russians' tactics so far suggest a campaign to grind down resistance south of the city -- in places like Syrotyne -- and then attack Ukrainian defenses from several directions. Ukrainian officials say the Russians are increasingly using drones to identify their defensive positions. ""The Russian military monitors the air day and night with drones, adjusts firepower, quickly adapts to our changes in defensive areas,"" said Serhii Hayday, head of the Luhansk regional military administration. Elsewhere along an active frontline that stretches for more than 1,000 kilometers (more than 620 miles), little territory is currently ceded or taken. The Russians' principal goals in Donbas are to take the industrial city and transport hub of Sloviansk and the town of Bakhmut, both in Donetsk -- but they've made very limited progress towards either objective. They may also be vulnerable to Ukrainian counterattacks south and west of the city of Izium. Southern Ukraine represents a different picture. The Russians appear to be consolidating gains won in the opening days of the war, along lines that allow them to defend a coastal belt in depth. Ukrainian counterattacks towards Kherson city have made limited progress, as the Russians are now well dug-in and show little appetite for trying to win more territory. As UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson put it Sunday, after his second visit to Kyiv: ""Time is the vital factor. Everything will depend on whether Ukraine can strengthen its ability to defend its soil faster than Russia can renew its capacity to attack."" Brittle morale Some of Ukraine's best military units have been punished during the defense of Donbas. Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told CNN last week that tens of thousands of Ukrainians had been killed since the Russian invasion began on February 24. Probably the vast majority have been soldiers. The UK Defense Ministry assessed this weekend that Ukrainian forces have likely suffered desertions in recent weeks -- though it believes Russian morale is much more brittle. So, it's not solely about getting accurate long-range weapons to Ukrainian forces but also stepping up training. Johnson is pushing a plan whereby allies develop the potential to train up to 10,000 soldiers every 120 days. Despite their losses, and even as they deploy vintage T62 tanks in some places, Russian forces retain huge superiority in armor and combat aviation. And despite a ponderous and predictable strategy, they can continue to obliterate Ukrainian defenses. Video emerged at the weekend revealing the scale of destruction in Lyman, near Sloviansk, just as Popasna and Rubizhne further east were leveled in April. But with an accelerated flow of weapons capable of blunting Russia's advantage in heavy artillery and rocket systems, Ukrainian forces might yet prevent the enemy from inflicting such devastation on more towns and cities further west.",7,4.266858217322271,7.5820318523654695,-3.315173635043198,13
2022-06-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/19/politics/us-worries-russia-exploit-divisions-2022-midterms/index.html,US is worried about Russia using new efforts to exploit divisions in 2022 midterms,"Homeland and national security officials are worried about how Russia could significantly exploit US divisions over the November midterms, considering scenarios like Russia staging smaller hacks of local election authorities -- done with the deliberate purpose of being noticed -- and then using that to seed more conspiracies about the integrity of American elections. These efforts, the officials said, would be designed to dovetail with the false doubts about the 2020 presidential election spread by former President Donald Trump and many of his allies. The five current and former US officials who spoke to CNN stressed that such a scenario remains hypothetical. Although US elections have become more secure in recent years, officials say that an atmosphere of distrust in America's elections, coupled with the sheer number of local election systems, means there's no way to truly be ready for such a convergence of Russian asymmetric warfare techniques. Administration officials agree with local election officials that the problem goes beyond inevitable security shortfalls. Current and former officials say little has been done to inform, let alone convince, American voters that Russia is trying to attack US elections again. That's creating a battle for public perceptions of the security of elections, which often don't mirror the reality of how secure they are. ""If something small happens, it will feed into the mania and chaos, and all of a sudden people will think all the elections are completely insecure,"" said Nicole Tisdale, who until April was the legislative affairs director at the National Security Council and previously served as the director for cybersecurity and counterintelligence with the House Homeland Security Committee. ""It's not about fixing a small problem so that it doesn't become a bigger problem. It's about what happens when folks feel there's been any leak in the boat, and folks thinking that the whole thing could sink,"" Tisdale said. An example of how officials believe the threat could play out: Russian hackers breach a local county voter registration system, making sure to get detected. They would then post information and proudly take responsibility rather than blame third-party hackers, as they did in 2016. Then, other Kremlin-backed forces would amplify the problems on Facebook and Twitter, aiming to churn up angry -- and violent -- reactions. ""Russia doesn't have to do anything in advance of the election -- just observe where operational challenges occur and use that issue to exploit the subsequent distrust and division,"" said one US official involved in election security. ""The asymmetrical advantage is astounding."" It likely wouldn't take much to further undermine faith in American elections -- as this month's public hearings of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol have shown. Adrienne Ray, the elections supervisor and registrar in highly competitive Peach County, Georgia, said she feels under siege, trying to keep her systems from being at the center of a story about international espionage. In the meantime, she relies on her IT guy, while taking online classes about election security offered by the Georgia secretary of state's office. ""I'm not a whiz at what these people could do,"" Ray said. ""But we try our best to be as secure as possible. ... Do I know if I'm getting everything I need to know? I don't know."" Russian efforts capitalizing on American divisions Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis warned that Russia will ""likely"" look to depress voting and ""probably"" try to undermine the November midterms in revenge for the American-led response to the invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly declassified DHS report obtained by CNN. ""We expect Russian interference in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections, as Russia views this activity as an equitable response to perceived actions by Washington and an opportunity to both undermine US global standing and influence US decision-making,"" states the report, titled ""Key Threats to the Homeland Through 2022."" Russian attempts to interfere with and undermine American elections have been happening for almost a decade, but the evolution has US officials on edge. Most of the hacking that was tracked in 2016 was probing, looking for openings. Disinformation efforts were still rudimentary, elevating a few voices spouting racial divisions and disappointment in their candidates losing. But those efforts now more often use a wide array of avenues to play off divisions within the US about immigration, Covid-19 restrictions and 2020 election conspiracies. Meanwhile, intelligence officials say the disinformation methods have become broader and more sophisticated, as have the attempts to combine them. Explaining Russian interference and the ways in which those efforts look to play off current divisions, officials argue, would be essential to both understanding and withstanding the threat -- but just doing so often runs up against the hyperpartisan reality. ""It's sometimes difficult to even discuss mitigation activities because of the political environment in Washington,"" said John Cohen, who until last month served as the acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. ""There are foreign nations like Russia who are seeking to destabilize and weaken the United States, and they do that by pushing out information meant to exacerbate the social fractures of our society."" Local election offices have stepped up their own security, but it's not clear that will be enough. In small-but-competitive Sauk County, Wisconsin, results received into the main clerk's office are then verified by phone calls to officials at each polling place, followed by a full canvas to make sure the numbers and records match up. Equipment is kept locked up and under video surveillance. None of the machines are connected to the internet, and two-factor authentication is required even to get into employee desktops. ""This is way different from when I started, that's for sure,"" said Becky Evert, the Sauk County clerk, reflecting on how she's had to respond to the threat of Russian hacking. Evert said that she's confident that any breach would be caught but that she hadn't considered what it would mean if the intention was to get caught. Some funding for new security came from the state, but she said she hasn't been directly in touch with the federal government. In Philadelphia, the city has disconnected its election management system from the internet and met with state and federal authorities running ""tabletop"" exercises to iron out communications and plans for what to do if they detect a breach -- including trying to wrap their heads around what to do if the breach is meant to be detected. ""I've had to become sort of an expert in election security, cybersecurity, GIS (geographic information system) mapping, social mapping, physical security, I know more information about things that I never thought I'd know anything about,"" said Lisa Deeley, a Philadelphia city commissioner, calling threats the ""scary and unpleasant"" part of her job. ""Unfortunately, this is the world of elections today."" ""If there was some kind of breach, the city and the state and the federal government would all align and give us the defense that we needed,"" Deeley said, while adding, ""With elections, there's always a need for more funding and more resources."" Growing concern about elections as November approaches The DHS intelligence assessment of current threats obtained by CNN states that Russia remains a top threat ""particularly in response to international pressure following its unprovoked attack on Ukraine."" The DHS assessment also includes threats from China and Iran, though they are not primarily election-related. The China threats listed include cyber-espionage, predatory economic activity and influence campaigns to promote Beijing's interests. The Iran threats include cyber-threats to critical networks and ""stoking divisions within the United States and creating pressure on Washington to change its policy on Iran,"" as well as more conventional terrorist attacks via Hezbollah or other proxies. The threat assessment from Russia is different, however. Whether by dissuading Americans from voting, convincing them the votes are crooked or just making them lose faith in the candidates and institutions involved, ""Moscow's overarching objective is to undermine the US electoral process and weaken the United States through social and political discord, division, and distraction,"" the report states. As Russian President Vladimir Putin accelerated toward his invasion of Ukraine in February, officials from DHS and other agencies began meeting daily to discuss potential threats and responses. Election security was one of the topics from the start, though at that point -- with November many months away -- they focused mostly on more immediate possible vulnerabilities around power grids and banking systems. ""People believe that this is one of these ways in which Putin potentially gets back at us without triggering a kinetic response of some kind. There's a lot of concerns that if he were to try to punch back at us for supporting Ukraine, this is one of the ways he'd do it,"" said an administration official familiar with the internal discussions. Those meetings have grown less frequent, but the concerns around elections have grown, as November has gotten closer and the Russian quagmire in Ukraine has continued. The alert has remained high within the White House and among the members of the interagency election security group created in the Biden administration, even as they've struggled with what to do. White House officials are aware that any attempt by President Joe Biden to speak about disinformation or Russian hacking would immediately be seen as political, as would most efforts by the federal government to fell local authorities how to administer elections. ""The federal government is still trying to figure out how to bring together all of the capabilities it has to engage in a comprehensive manner,"" Cohen said. A National Security Council spokesperson declined comment. Though national security officials did not initially believe that Putin was moving on Ukraine with the intention of creating problems geared toward the US midterms -- either through driving up gas prices or sowing a general sense of chaos -- as the crisis escalated, according to two officials, the intelligence became increasingly concerned that the American response would convince Putin that the 2022 elections were a legitimate and high-priority target.

2022-06-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/politics/elections-midterms-2022-security-threats/index.html,Election officials worry about their safety ahead of midterms,"When US intelligence and national security officials gathered at a classified facility in April to speak with election officials around the country, there was no burning new intelligence to share about cyber threats to American democracy. The briefing covered Russia's war on Ukraine and foreign and domestic sources of disinformation about US elections, according to three people familiar with the briefing. But there was a striking change from pre-2020 briefings: It touched on violent threats to election officials that stem from conspiracy theories about the voting process. Physical security concerns have ""really ramped up since 2020 because of threats that we've seen to state and local officials across the country,"" said Kim Wyman, the top election security official at the federal US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which has encouraged election workers to report threats to law enforcement and is hiring more staff to advise election officials on physical threats. Many of the thousands of local election officials in the US are living with a new reality as the midterm elections approach: They have spent countless hours rebutting false claims from former President Donald Trump and his supporters that the 2020 election was stolen while wondering about their personal safety and trying to prepare for future elections on a limited budget. At the same time, local election officials have to keep an eye out for cyber threats that might exacerbate misinformation about the voting process. It's a new hybrid threat environment -- encompassing potential physical and digital threats and how the public perceives them -- shaped by the 2020 election and the false narratives of fraud that emerged from it. ""It's exhausting,"" said Barb Byrum, who for nearly a decade has overseen elections in Michigan's Ingham County, home to roughly 285,000 people. ""We're always fielding conspiracy claims,"" Byrum said, describing a plethora of emails (some of which read, ""shame on you"") and public records requests in search of voter fraud. Byrum is buying a new set of blinds for her office after hearing about election officials elsewhere facing death threats. She keeps her head on a swivel around Ingham County, which is home to the capital of Lansing and voted by 2 to 1 for Joe Biden in 2020. ""You can't just plan for any one scenario,"" Wyman said in her first interview since the Biden administration tapped her in October to lead the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's election security efforts. She's been crisscrossing the country encouraging election officials to enlist in free federal cybersecurity services and to speak out with a clear voice against false information about voting. 'A race without a finish line' In this year's midterms and the 2024 general election, the spotlight will be on election workers like never before, a portion of voters could cry fraud if their candidate loses and foreign spies or trolls could exploit the environment to chip further away at voter confidence. ""Let's face it: In terms of foreign influence, actors like Russia have [a history of ] coordinated efforts where they are not only trying to attack the confidence that voters have in the United States of our election system and to try to sow discord and ... amplify that mis- and disinformation that is out there,"" Wyman said, ""but that is a coordinated effort with their attacks on the cyber infrastructure as well."" ""None of that has gone away,"" she added. Nonetheless, Wyman told CNN that US officials are not currently aware of any ""specific or credible threat to the 2022 elections. But this is that proverbial race without a finish line. We're telling election officials to ... continue to have that heightened state of vigilance."" Federal officials are trying to get ahead of any foreign influence campaigns in part by amplifying the voices of local election officials, hoping that they can effectively debunk conspiracy theories about the voting process that bots and trolls might seize on. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is advising state and local officials to set up their own dedicated websites to combat election-related rumors and misinformation in the hope that voters will trust their local clerks more than an unfamiliar face in Washington. ""We see that people trust their local election officials more than they might information that's coming from the state ... or the federal government,"" said Meagan Wolfe, the head of the Wisconsin Elections Commission. ""These are their neighbors and their friends."" Convincing voters of the integrity of the voting system -- which numerous audits of the 2020 election have affirmed -- is still a tall task. About half of Americans surveyed think it is likely that a future election will be overturned for partisan reasons, according to a CNN poll published in February. ""Voter confidence is the thing that I worry about the most,"" said Wolfe, who, as Wisconsin's top elections official, has publicly debunked conspiracy theories about the state's elections. As a Republican secretary of state in Washington state in the 2020 election, Wyman pushed back on Trump's false claims of election fraud. ""The polarization we saw coming out of 2020 -- I'm not sure it's possible in some ways to convince [some] people that the election was secure,"" Wyman told CNN. ""I think the better place for us to spend our time is really trying to be transparent about the way that we conduct elections in this country, the security measures that are put in both cyber and physical security for securing our elections, how we are being accountable for all of those ballots that we produce results for,"" Wyman said. Another point of emphasis for her agency's team ahead of the midterms: helping election administrators secure their voter registration databases, which Russian and Iranian hackers targeted in the 2016 and 2020 elections, respectively. Though a lot of information found in voter registration databases is public, the data sets can be used to sow doubts about the election. Money talks Domestic and foreign threats converged in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when, the FBI concluded, Iranian operatives set up a website that included death threats to US election officials and their personal information. But elections experts say the sector needs more money and people to deal with that type of blended threat in the years ahead. States will need more than $500 million over the next five years to replace aging voting equipment, according to the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice, to say nothing of the money needed to protect election workers from physical threats. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has 127 physical security specialists across the country who can assess election facilities for safety; the agency plans to hire 15 more by the end of the year. The Justice Department has encouraged prosecutors to pursue charges against those threatening election officials when merited, while emphasizing that a criminal justice grants program that gives states millions of dollars each year can be used to protect against physical threats. But the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Justice Department division overseeing the grants, as of June 6 had not reported any use of the funds to protect against threats of violence to election workers, a department spokesperson told CNN. A draft of the House Appropriations Committee's fiscal 2023 funding bill for financial and government services would give the federal Election Assistance Commission $400 million in security grants to distribute to the states. That money would be welcome, but election funding efforts are still falling short overall, according to Ben Hovland, an EAC commissioner. ""In the fallout from the big lie, with physical threats and harassment of election officials added to cybersecurity challenges and the continuing pandemic, it's never been harder to administer elections and it's never been more expensive,"" Hovland told CNN. ""The real question that policymakers have to ask themselves is: Are we willing to invest in our democracy in the way that it deserves to be?"" A 42-year-old Nebraska man pleaded guilty Thursday to threatening an election official on Instagram and faces up to two years in prison. Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Dick Durbin of Illinois on Thursday asked the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to consider issuing a public service announcement to local law enforcement agencies ""to ensure that they are aware of both the recent increase in these threats against election officials and federal resources for reporting and countering them."" The threats to and harassment of election officials have taken a toll on the profession. Nearly 1 in 3 local election officials know of election workers who have left their jobs at least in part out of fear for their safety or because of increased threats or intimidation, according to a survey released by the Brennan Center in March. Despite the turnover, there are still thousands of experienced election officials across the country who can draw on closer ties they've forged with federal officials, and one another, since the 2016 election to deal with the new landscape of physical and cyber threats. ""Because of all the work that we've been doing together since 2016 in addressing cybersecurity concerns, we've been able to include in those conversations physical security concerns and preparations,"" Wolfe said.",20,4.269030819845369,5.1114624947759095,-0.8424316749305403,14
2022-06-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/politics/russia-syria-warning/index.html,Russia warned US it was going to conduct airstrikes on fighters in Syria,"Russia warned the US military earlier this week that it was going to conduct airstrikes against local fighters allied with the US in southeastern Syria, according to two US defense officials. That led the US to quickly warn the fighters to move their positions and also ensure that no US forces were nearby. US forces did not have to move, as they were far enough away, but the local fighters did, the officials told CNN. The Russian airstrikes appear highly calculated, coming when tensions are high between Washington and Moscow over the war in Ukraine and the Pentagon is trying to ensure tensions don't escalate with Russian forces, including in Syria, where the two sides have operated in proximity to each other for several years. The initial US assessment is the Russian forces were likely ordered to notify the US ahead of time and conduct the airstrikes knowing they would not hit US troops and that the Americans would warn their allies, the officials said. But the Russians still likely achieved their goal of ""sending a message"" to the US that they can strike without being worried about retaliation, one official said. The notification by Russia came through the long-standing bilateral deconfliction line that has operated for several years, where each side notifies the other of military operations and movements that risk a miscalculation if each side is not aware of the other's activities. The US view is the Russians were minimizing the risk of a crisis, knowing the US would notify the local fighters. The incident happened in the vicinity of Al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria, where US and Syrian opposition forces have long operated. The strikes were conducted against positions where the US-backed Maghawir al-Thawra fighters were operating. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but property is believed to have been damaged. The US officials said the Russians claimed the group had conducted a roadside bomb attack against Russian forces. The US believes that did not happen and the Russians simply used it as a reason to conduct airstrikes. This kind of Russian provocation is rare but not unprecedented. In February 2018, an encounter rapidly escalated and became deadly when a 500-strong force largely made up of Russian contractors and a Christian militia loyal to the Syrian regime crossed the Euphrates river near Deir Ezzor. The Russians were working for a paramilitary company called Wagner, which had hundreds of contractors on the ground in Syria, helping the Russian military and pro-regime forces. The mission of that night's operation remains unclear, but the forces were advancing toward a valuable oil and gas field, Coneco, controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed militia that has been fighting ISIS in Syria. When the pro-regime forces began shelling a base held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the US responded with heavy airstrikes and artillery fire, which continued for about three hours. US commanders tried to reach their Russian counterparts through deconfliction channels to warn of their response. But by the time communications were established, the counterattack was underway. And in August 2020, multiple US troops were injured in a collision with a Russian military convoy in eastern Syria.",7,4.326867708188128,3.818241966868202,0.5086257413199258,0

US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday ahead of the announcement, which the Pentagon said included providing Ukraine with 18 howitzers, 36,000 rounds of howitzer ammunition and two Harpoon coastal defense systems. ""I informed President Zelensky that the United States is providing another $1 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, including additional artillery and coastal defense weapons, as well as ammunition for the artillery and advanced rocket systems that the Ukrainians need to support their defensive operations in the Donbas,"" Biden said in a statement after the call. ""We also discussed Secretary Austin's efforts in Brussels today to coordinate additional international support for the Ukrainian armed forces."" Speaking in Brussels, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US and Ukraine are ""working in lockstep to meet Ukraine's requests for new capabilities, especially its need for long-range fires, armor and coastal defense."" The latest weapons package comes as Ukraine's military is burning through its Soviet-era ammunition, while Ukrainian officials have pleaded with the West to send additional heavy weaponry as the war with Russia girds on. Western intelligence and military officials believe the war is at a critical stage that could determine the long-term outcome of the conflict, while Russia has amassed a significant artillery advantage around two key cities in eastern Ukraine. Zelensky thanked Biden on Wednesday for his ""consistent, unwavering support"" and for mobilizing the international security, according to a statement from the Ukrainian president's office. ""The security support from the United States is unprecedented. It brings us closer to a common victory over the Russian aggressor,"" Zelensky said. A Pentagon spokesman said the US has now committed more than $5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February. The latest tranche of weapons includes ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, and tactical vehicles ""to recover equipment,"" as well as thousands of secure radios and thousands of night vision devices, thermal sightsand ""other optics,"" the Pentagon said. The package is expected to include weapons and supplies that can be quickly shipped from existing US stockpiles as well as issuing new contracts for long term supplies for The US will also provide $225 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, which Biden said will go toward ""supplying safe drinking water, critical medical supplies and health care, food, shelter, and cash for families to purchase essential items."" Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley on Wednesday were in Brussels, where a meeting was held with a working group of nearly 50 countries to discuss the crisis. 'No weapons system is a silver bullet' The US has sent a number of weapons shipments to Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in February, increasing the capabilities that it's provided to Ukraine's military as the conflict has continued. Ukrainian officials, however, have been pushing for more heavy weaponry and have expressed frustrations that munitions appear to be trickling into the fight piecemeal. Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Tuesday that the country has only received 10% of the military assistance Kyiv has requested from the West. ""Whatever efforts we put, no matter how professional our army is, without the assistance of our Western partners Ukraine will not be able to win this war,"" Mailar said. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Milley pushed back on the notion that Ukraine wasn't getting what is needed, saying he was in regular contact with his Ukrainian counterpart. ""The speed that we have delivered security assistance is without comparison,"" Milley said. ""From the time the requests are validated and authorized, it is only a matter of days until the requirement is sourced, shipped and in the hands of the Ukrainians. In some cases, it may take a week, but most of the time, it's measured in days."" Milley added that ""in warfare, no weapons system is a silver bullet, ever."" ""So no weapons system, singular weapons system ever, quote unquote turns the balance,"" Milley said If the Ukrainians use the weapons systems that the US and other allies are providing properly, Milley said, ""They ought to be able to take out a significant amount of targets."" Russian control of eastern Ukraine not 'an inevitability,' Milley says Milley said that despite Russian forces outnumbering and outgunning the Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region, Russian consolidation of its control in eastern Ukraine was ""not a done deal."" ""There are no inevitabilities in war. War takes many, many turns. So I wouldn't say it's an inevitability,"" he said, before granting that ""the numbers clearly favor the Russians."" Milley said that the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk ""is probably three quarters taken or so by Russian forces"" but that ""the Ukrainians are fighting them street by street, house by house."" Milley also characterized the current phase of the war as a ""very severe battle of attrition, almost World War I-like,"" noting how Russian progress in the region has been ""very slow, a very tough slog."" ""The Russians have run into a lot of problems. They've got command-and-control issues, logistics issues. They've got morale issues, leadership issues and a wide variety of other issues,"" Milley said. ""And the Russians have suffered tremendous amounts of casualties.""

2022-06-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/15/politics/russian-imperial-movement-sanctions/index.html,US imposes terrorist designation on man tied to Russian White supremacist group,"The United States government on Wednesday designated an individual connected to the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM) -- an ultranationalist, White supremacist organization -- as a terrorist and sanctioned two others for involvement with the group. The organization and three of its leaders were classified as terrorists in 2020 by the US State Department -- the first time in history the agency had designated a White supremacist group as such. On Wednesday, the State Department announced it was designating Anton Thulin as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) ""for posing a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism."" Thulin, a Swedish national, traveled to Russia in 2016 ""and received paramilitary training from RIM, including in bomb-making,"" according to a statement from State Department spokesperson Ned Price. He was convicted by a Swedish court in 2017 and sentenced to 22 months in prison ""in connection with the detection of a powerful homemade bomb near a refugee residential center in Gothenburg, Sweden,"" Price said. According to the State Department, ""after serving his sentence, Thulin sought to receive additional paramilitary training in Poland, before he was expelled by Polish authorities who cited the 'serious, real, and current threat to security and public order' he posed."" ""The United States is designating Anton Thulin because his continued pursuit of terrorist training, even after serving his prison sentence for his role in the 2017 attack in Sweden, demonstrates that he continues to pose a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism,"" the department said. The terrorist designations deny Thulin access to the US financial system, with the intention of making it more difficult to move money through the international system and fund their efforts. The US Treasury also slapped sanctions on European-based RIM member Stanislav Shevchuk and Russian-based supporter Alexander Zhuchkovsky. Shevchuk was sanctioned ""for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, RIM;"" Zhuchkovsky, ""for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, RIM."" According to the Treasury statement, Shevchuk ""travelled to the United States in 2017 with the objective of establishing connections between RIM and far-right extremist and white nationalist groups."" ""He has also spoken on behalf of RIM at rallies in Europe and advocated publicly for the group throughout Europe as recently as 2019,"" it said. Zhuchkovsky ""has repeatedly used his account on Russia-based social media platform VK, formerly known as VKontakte, to fundraise and recruit for RIM,"" the statement said. ""Since 2014, Zhuchkovsky has raised over 200 million rubles to purchase weapons and military equipment for RIM and other pro-Russian fighters in the Donbas in Ukraine and has facilitated the travel of RIM fighters to the region,"" it continued. ""Since Russia began its unprovoked war against Ukraine in February 2022, Zhuchkovsky has continued using his social media accounts and online payment methods to purchase military equipment and supplies for Russian fighters carrying out the invasion of Ukraine and continued fighting in the Donbas Region."" ""Zhuchkovsky has also taught at RIM's Partizan training center in St. Petersburg, Russia, where participants receive training to conduct acts of terrorism and violence,"" it added.",20,4.326121464712605,6.2974177232826865,-1.9712962585700815,4
2022-06-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/politics/ukraine-war-pivotal-moment-intelligence-officials-loses-in-the-east-russia/index.html,"War in Ukraine reaches pivotal moment that could determine long-term outcome, intelligence officials say","Ukraine's military is burning through Soviet-era ammunition that fits older systems as the country pleads with the West to send more heavy weaponry and Russia amasses a significant artillery advantage around two strategically important cities in eastern Ukraine. Western intelligence and military officials believe Russia's war in Ukraine is in a critical stage that could determine the long-term outcome of the conflict, according to multiple sources familiar with US and other Western intelligence. This pivotal moment could also force a tough decision for Western governments, which have up until now offered support to Ukraine at a steadily increasing cost to their own economies and national stockpiles of weapons. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is poised to lead a working group of nearly 50 countries to discuss the crisis on Wednesday, when the US expects more announcements of weapons and equipment packages for Ukraine, according to a senior US defense official. Ukrainian officials have expressed frustration that these vital munitions appear to be trickling into the fight piecemeal -- and have raised fears that Western commitment may be softening at a decisive moment. ""I think that you're about to get to the point where one side or the other will be successful,"" said a senior NATO official. ""Either the Russians will reach Slovyansk and Kramatorsk or the Ukrainians will stop them here. And if the Ukrainians are able to hold the line here, in the face of this number forces, that will matter."" Three potential outcomes Western officials are closely watching three possible scenarios that they believe could unfold: Russia could continue to make incremental gains in two key eastern provinces. Or the battle lines could harden into a stalemate that drags on for months or years, leading to tremendous casualties on both sides and a slow-rolling crisis that will continue to be a drain on the global economy. Then there is what officials consider the least likely possibility: Russia could redefine its war aims, announce that it has achieved victory and attempt to engineer a close to the fighting. For now, that scenario appears to be little more than wishful thinking, sources say. If Russia is able to consolidate some of its gains in the east, US officials increasingly fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin may eventually be able to use that territory as a staging ground to push further into Ukraine. ""I am sure that if Ukraine is not strong enough, they will go further,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Tuesday in a bid to urge the West to send more weapons faster. ""We have shown to them our strength. And it is important for this strength to be also demonstrated together with us by our Western partners as well."" Western military aid, he said, ""has to come quicker"" if Ukraine's allies want to stymie Russia's territorial ambitions. Western officials broadly believe that Russia is in a more favorable position in the east, based solely on mass. Still, ""Russian progress is not a foregone conclusion,"" said one senior Biden administration official. As the front lines of the conflict have settled into a war of attrition built around back-and-forth artillery fire, both sides have suffered tremendous casualties and now face potential manpower shortfalls. Russia has also suffered losses of as much as a third of its ground force, and US intelligence officials have said publicly that Russia will struggle to make any serious gains without a full mobilization, a politically dangerous move that Putin has so far been unwilling to make. For now, the fighting is centered on two sister cities on opposite sides of the Seversky Donets River, Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Ukrainian fighters are almost completely encircled at Sievierodonetsk. Even though Western analysts believe Ukraine stands a better chance of defending Lysychansk, which sits on high ground, there are already troubling signs that Russian is attempting to cut off the city's supply lines by advancing from the southeast. ""In many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided"" around these two cities, Zelensky said last week. A preference for Soviet systems US officials insist that Western arms are still flowing to the front lines of the fight. But local reports of weapons shortages -- and frustrated pleas from Ukrainian officials on the front lines -- have raised questions about how effectively supply lines are running. Ukraine has begged not only for heavy artillery but also for even more basic supplies, like ammunition. Part of the problem, sources say, is that even as Ukraine is running out of old Soviet munitions that fit existing systems, there have also been obstacles to transitioning its fighters to Western, NATO-compliant systems. For one thing, training soldiers on these systems takes time -- and takes needed fighters away from the battlefield. In some cases, according to one source familiar with US intelligence, Ukraine is simply opting not to use the unfamiliar Western systems. For example, despite receiving hundreds of Switchblade drones, some units prefer to use commercial drones rigged with explosives that are more user-friendly. The Biden administration announced a new aid package earlier this month that included the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HiMARS, which is capable of launching a barrage of rockets and missiles and which Ukraine had urgently requested for weeks. But although a small group of Ukrainian soldiers began training on the system almost immediately after the package was announced, it requires three weeks of training and has not yet entered the fight. The senior defense official would say only that the system will enter Ukraine ""soon."" Meanwhile, there are a limited number of Soviet-era munitions still existing elsewhere in the world that can be sent to Ukraine. The US is urging nations with older stockpiles to figure out what they have available to give Ukraine, but the punishing artillery battle is ""wiping Soviet stuff off the face of the earth"" for Ukraine and the allies supplying it, according to a US official. Although the US has a clear picture of Russian battlefield losses, it has struggled from the beginning to assess Ukraine's fighting strength. Officials have acknowledged that the US doesn't have a clear picture of where Western arms go or how effectively they are used once they cross the border into Ukraine -- making intelligence predictions about the fighting difficult and policy decisions about how and when to resupply Ukraine equally tricky. The senior Biden administration official told CNN that the US is trying to ""better understand their [the Ukrainians'] consumption rate and operational pace,"" when asked specifically if Ukraine is running low on ammunition and weapons. ""It's hard to know,"" this person said. It's clear that Ukraine is heavily using the artillery the US and other Western nations have provided, because much of it moves in and out of the country for repairs. That blind spot is in part because Ukraine doesn't tell the West everything, Western officials say. And because the fighting is concentrated in such a small area relatively close to Russia, Western intelligence services don't have the same visibility that they do elsewhere. ""As you get down to the tactical level, especially in the location where the majority of the fighting is, it's further away from us, closer to Russia, and the forces are more densely packed in very, very close to each other,"" the senior NATO official said. ""So it's difficult to get a good granular picture of the status of fighting occasionally in the east."" It's also difficult to predict how Ukraine's military will perform in this pivotal moment because as casualties have mounted, hastily trained civilian volunteers are being sent into the fight, the NATO official added. Their performance under fire is an unknown quantity. ""It's one thing to have people available, but the question is, are they ready for the fight? I think you're going to see that as a factor,"" the official said. Predicting Putin's next move Meanwhile, US and other Western officials see no sign that Putin's commitment to prosecuting the costly war has diminished. ""In terms of the strategic aims that we judge Putin has vis-a-vis Ukraine, I don't see any signs that those have changed,"" the NATO official said. ""Putin still believes that eventually he will be successful and will either physically control or will gain a form of political control over Ukraine in either significant part or ideally in whole."" But even if Putin's commitment remains ironclad, there is a growing awareness that the West's might not be. As the fighting has dragged on, the cost to Western governments has continued to rise. Some Western governments -- including the United States -- have become concerned that the flow of donated weapons to Ukraine has depleted national stockpiles critical to their own defense. ""It's a valid concern"" for the United States, the senior administration official acknowledged. Then, of course, there is the sting of high energy prices and high inflation. As those costs begin to impact ordinary citizens, in the US and in Europe, and as media attention begins to drift from the day-to-day grind of the fighting, some officials fear Western support for Ukraine may wane. The spokesperson for the Ukrainian military's international legion on Monday derided a ""sense of complacency"" among Ukraine's military patrons, saying the country needs far more support if it is to defeat Russia's invasion. ""There's a certain sense of complacency that seems to have fallen over our Western partners that the arms deliveries that Ukraine has been already provided with are somehow enough to win the war,"" said Damien Magrou, spokesperson for the International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine, during a news conference. ""They are not! They do not come near anything that would be close to enabling us to defeat the Russians on the battlefield.""",7,3.0232411371258667,2.3104409576601466,0.7128001794657202,23

Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is gaining ground in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, specifically in the city of Severodonetsk, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting recently. Without an influx of more weapons, some Ukrainian officials have said it will be increasingly difficult to halt Russia's incremental progress or reclaim occupied ground in the region. ""We hear what they're saying, we absolutely hear what they're saying,"" said the senior defense official, who spoke of the ""urgency"" of the Ukraine Contact Group meeting Thursday in Brussels. The official would not detail what countries would be announcing new security packages or what those shipments would include but noted that the US works ""very closely"" with allies to figure out what Ukraine's armed forces need and then find those systems to send over. The official would also not say whether the US would make a new announcement but said the Biden administration is already working on the next weapons package. ""It's a constant drumbeat because it's a constant battle"" with ""constantly evolving urgent requirements,"" the official told a group of reporters traveling with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The administration announced the last weapons package at the beginning of June, including High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HiMARS), a system capable of launching a barrage of rockets and missiles which Ukraine had urgently requested for weeks. The $700 million package was the first time the administration had drawn from last month's $40 billion aid package for Ukraine, which received bipartisan support in Congress. A small group of Ukrainian soldiers began training on HiMARS almost immediately after the weapons package was announced. But the system, which requires three weeks of training, has not yet entered the fight. The senior defense official would only say that it will enter Ukraine ""soon."" The US has taken on ""some risk"" to its own military readiness in sending weapons and equipment to Ukraine, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said earlier this month, but it was ""not an unacceptable level of risk at all."" The senior defense official said the US and it allies have a significant amount of equipment still available to send to Ukraine. ""We have far from exhausted the resource and the multi-country security assistance for this battle on Ukrainian territory,"" the official said. Zelensky asks for more Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky vowed in an evening speech on Monday that Ukraine would liberate all of the territories occupied by Russia, even the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed shortly after its takeover in 2014. But that could only happen, he said, if more weapons are sent to Ukraine. ""It only takes enough weapons to make it happen. The partners have it. In sufficient quantities. And we work every day for the political will to give us these weapons to appear,"" Zelensky said. Ukrainian officials have said 100 to 200 soldiers a day are dying in the fighting, a number that raises some doubts about the ability of the Ukrainian armed forces to sustain such losses. The US official said they don't doubt the casualty figures. ""The numbers are not out of line with what you would expect for this kind of artillery battle,"" the official said. ""It's not surprising that the numbers the Ukrainians are reporting are that serious."" But the official said the US has not seen a flagging of Ukrainian morale to remain in the fight, even as the conflict becomes a grinding, brutal battle of artillery that may favor the firepower and manpower of Russia's military. The official sounded a more optimistic note about the state of the war, even as Russia appears to be gaining momentum in the Donbas region. Problems of morale, poor command, and supply issues have plagued the Russian military since the beginning of the invasion. Russia was able to paper over some of those issues when the focus shifted to eastern Ukraine, since the battlefield bordered Russia, making it much easier to send supplies over the short distance to units on the front line. A lot of Russia's high-end equipment has already been destroyed, the official said, forcing them to rely on older models. At the same time, Russia's stock of precision munitions is dwindling, leading to the use of more artillery, which has had devastating consequences with its lack of precision. Sanctions and export restrictions have also made it higher to resupply their high-end capabilities, the official said. Despite all the challenges the Russians have faced -- both self-inflicted and as a result of Ukraine's counterattacks -- Moscow still retains its biggest advantage: the sheer size of its military. But that doesn't mean Russia is guaranteed victory, even if Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no indication that he is considering scaling back his goals.",7,3.5341528418038552,2.9308004068539044,0.6033524349499508,8

Petro Andrushenko, an adviser to the elected Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol, warned on Tuesday of an increasingly dire situation in that city, which was ""being quietly closed"" by Russia due to the potential cholera outbreak amid deteriorating sanitary conditions. ""The occupiers seem to have realized that there is such a challenge,"" Andrushchenko said on national television. ""There are talks about quarantine. The city is being quietly closed."" Andrushchenko, who is not in the city but has been a reliable conduit of information from Mariupol, said that it was ""difficult to convey"" the bleak conditons of the once-thriving vacation spot by the Sea of Azov. ""The city has really turned into one with corpses everywhere,"" he said. ""They are piled. The occupiers cannot cope with burying them even in mass graves. There is not enough capacity even for this."" CNN cannot independently confirm Andrushchenko's claims. Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness that kills thousands of people worldwide each year. It is easily transmitted, by consuming food or water contaminated with the fecal bacteria Vibrio cholerae. ' A huge hazard' The World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed concerns about cholera in the city, saying it received ""information that there are swamps actually in the streets, and the sewage water and drinking water are getting mixed,"" Dr. Dorit Nitzan, the emergencies coordinator for WHO's European region, said on May 17 in Kyiv. During Nitzan's visit to Ukraine last month, she decribed Mariupol's hygienic situation as a ""a huge hazard."" Andrushchenko said natural water sources in the city are decreasing as the warmer months arrive. He said Russian evacuations from the city had stopped, and that leaving the city is no longer possible. ""You can enter the city with a residence permit in Mariupol. But this is a one-way ticket, because you cannot leave. ""Of all the possible scenarios to fight the epidemic, in our opinion, Russia has chosen, as always, the most cynical one -- just to close the people in the city and leave everything as it is: Whoever survives, survives,"" he said. The deputy mayor of Mariupol, Serhiy Orlov, who is also not in the city, said Tuesday that he believes around 150,000 people remain out of a pre-invasion population of more than 400,000, and a further 30,000 to 40,000 in surrounding suburbs. Orlov claimed that Russian had taken large amounts of medical equipment from Mariupol to the separatist city of Donetsk. Mariupol has witnessed some of the heaviest fighting of the invasion. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater. Before falling under Russian control, the city was a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as it sustained relentless attacks. Conditions deterioriated rapidly over the course of the war, with food and water dwindling in the city. The battle for the city ended in May when Russian forces ended the final holdout of Ukrainian resistance in the Azovstal steel plant. Ukraine last suffered a major cholera epidemic in 1995 and has experienced minor outbreaks since, ""especially around the Azov sea coast -- which includes Mariupol,"" according to the British intelligence report. ""Medical services in Mariupol are likely already near collapse: a major cholera outbreak in Mariupol will exacerbate this further.""",47,6.579424418050831,5.191090956213623,1.3883334618372078,24
2022-06-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/europe/putin-ukraine-invasion-100-days-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html,"After 100 days of war, Putin is counting on the world's indifference","Rewind the clock to February 23, the day before Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine, and one might be tempted to guess that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's days in office were numbered. After all, Russia's military outspent that of Ukraine by roughly ten to one. Moscow enjoyed a twofold advantage over Kyiv in land forces; and the nuclear-armed power had ten times the aircraft and five times the armored fighting vehicles of its neighbor. A visibly angry Russian President Vladimir Putin had appeared on television just days before, delivering a rambling historical monologue that made clear he expected nothing less than regime change in Kyiv. The Kremlin leader seemed to be gambling that Zelensky would flee his capital, much as the US-backed president of Afghanistan had left Kabul just a few months earlier, and that Western outrage would subside, albeit with the temporary pain of new sanctions. 100 days later, whatever plans Putin may have had for a victory parade in Kyiv are on indefinite hold. Ukrainian morale did not collapse. Ukrainian troops, equipped with modern anti-tank weaponry delivered by the US and its allies, devastated Russian armored columns; Ukrainian missiles sank the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the pride of Russia's Black Sea Fleet; and Ukrainian aircraft stayed in the air, against the odds. In late March, Russia's military began withdrawing its battered troops from around the Ukrainian capital, claiming they had shifted focus to capturing country's eastern Donbas region. Three months after its invasion, Russia no longer appears to be aiming for a short, victorious war in Ukraine -- nor does it seem to be capable of achieving one. The problem with prognostication Does this mean Russia is losing? It's tempting to take a snapshot of the situation on a given day and draw sweeping conclusions. The Ukrainians have managed to kill Russian generals at an astonishing pace; Moscow has been forced to reorganize its military command after initial disarray; and Russian casualties, however elusive the official numbers, are shockingly high. But Russia now controls a crescent of Ukrainian territory that extends from around Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, continues through separatist-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk and reaches westward to Kherson, forming a land bridge linking the peninsula of Crimea (forcibly annexed by Russia in 2014) with the Donbas region. Russia's main direction of effort is now in the Donbas region, where things have settled into a grinding war of attrition. Recent fighting has focused around Severodonetsk, an industrial city where Ukrainian forces hold the last sliver of eastern Luhansk region. Ukrainian troops have ceded most of Severodonetsk to the Russians. The fall of the city will be a symbolic loss, but one that military analysts say spares the Ukrainian forces there from a protracted -- and likely losing -- siege. ""Kyiv could have committed more reserves and resources to the defense of Severodonetsk, and its failure to do so has drawn criticism,"" the US-based Institute for the Study of War said in a recent analysis. ""Both the decision to avoid committing more resources to saving Severodonetsk and the decision to withdraw from it were strategically sound, however painful. Ukraine must husband its more limited resources and focus on regaining critical terrain rather than on defending ground whose control will not determine the outcome of the war or the conditions for the renewal of war."" Amid the offensive on Severodonetsk, Oleksandr Motuzianyk, the Ukrainian defense ministry's spokesperson, said Russian forces were now ""trying encircle our troops in Donetsk and Luhansk regions,"" and regrouping to launch an offensive in the directions of Sloviansk, a strategic city that may be shaping up as the focus of the next pivotal battle. The battles in Ukraine's east are being fought in much more open terrain than the more densely-packed urban environment around Kyiv. That explains the urgency with which Ukrainians have requested heavier weaponry -- particularly artillery systems that can strike targets at longer ranges -- from the US and its allies. President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that the US will be sending more advanced rocket systems, including the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems with munitions that can launch rockets around 49 miles, a range far greater than anything Ukraine has been sent to date. That's welcome news for Kyiv, but Russia's offensive in the east is playing out as international media attention on Ukraine recedes somewhat from the headlines. And that may be what Putin is counting on, perhaps mindful that high energy costs and rising consumer prices -- both of which have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine -- are more likely to concentrate public opinion (and drive election outcomes) in the United States and elsewhere. Putin may also be counting on short diplomatic attention spans. This is the same Russian leader who doubled down on his support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2015 after Damascus suffered a string of defeats. That war -- now entering its 12th year -- has continued even as the world's attention has shifted to Ukraine. In that respect, Zelensky has been one of Ukraine's biggest assets in the information war. He has made a string of virtual appearances before parliaments around the globe, while reminding other world leaders who might be inclined to placate Putin by pushing for Ukraine to cede territory that it is the Ukrainian people, not he, who must decide outcomes. In Zelensky's appearances with wounded Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, the Ukrainian leader takes selfies and projects a warm, humane and self-effacing leadership style. That contrasts with the Russian leader's lone public visit to a military hospital: Putin, in an oversized white laboratory coat, met with wounded soldiers and officers who stood stiffly at attention before their commander-in-chief. But Putin, who has ended all domestic political opposition and effectively controls his country's airwaves, does not face the same domestic pressure as Zelensky. Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Putin's Security Council, said in recent remarks that Russian forces aren't ""chasing deadlines"" in Ukraine, suggesting Putin has a much more open-ended timeline for his war in Ukraine. Ukrainians, in contrast, fear international fatigue may set in, leading the international community to press their government to make concessions to Putin. ""You have the watches, but we have the time."" That saying, sometimes attributed to a captured Taliban fighter, summed up America's dilemma in fighting the Afghanistan war, a grudging acknowledgement that insurgencies operated on different political horizons and timelines, and that insurgents needed only to outlast -- not defeat -- the technologically superior US military. To repurpose that phrase, the deciding factor in Ukraine may be who has the time: A Russian dictator who is likely to hold power until he dies, or a Ukrainian people who are fighting for their national survival.",7,2.383909822593842,5.203960201024493,-2.8200503784306514,13
2022-06-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/politics/us-hackers-ukraine-support/index.html,US confirms military hackers have conducted cyber operations in support of Ukraine,"Cyber Command, the US military's hacking unit, has conducted offensive cyber operations in support of Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia's invasion, the head of the command has confirmed. The disclosure underscores how important projecting power in cyberspace -- in support of Ukraine's defenses and to potentially deter Russia from conducting cyberattacks against US infrastructure -- has been to the Biden administration as it continues to avoid directly engaging Russia in a shooting war. ""We've conducted a series of operations across the full spectrum; offensive, defensive, [and] information operations,"" General Paul Nakasone said in an interview with Sky News. A spokesperson for the command did not dispute the accuracy of the article but declined to elaborate on what the command's operations in Ukraine have entailed. It's a rare public acknowledgment from US military officials of hacking operations that are often shrouded in mystery. Nakasone's comments, and the White House's response to them, suggest that cyberspace is a domain in which the Biden administration feels comfortable countering Russia without fear of escalation. President Joe Biden has pledged not to engage directly with Russia militarily during the Ukraine war so long as the US and its allies aren't attacked. ""We don't see it as such,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday when asked at a news conference whether Cyber Command's actions contradicted Biden's pledge. Officials from Biden on down have for months warned about the threat of retaliatory Russian cyberattacks against US infrastructure after the US and its allies imposed sweeping sanctions on the Kremlin over its war in Ukraine. While analysts have proffered a range of theories, including improvements in US defenses, for why such a hack hasn't apparently happened yet, US officials tell CNN that Russian fear of escalation in cyberspace could be one factor. For one, Moscow may not want to risk retaliatory US cyberattacks that could hinder Russian military operations, a senior US defense intelligence official told CNN. The Russians have already had enough problems in Ukraine executing military operations, ""I think that adding any kind of potential for US cyber into that mix ... [is] probably factoring into their decision calculus,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about a sensitive national security issue. The paucity of Russian hacking on US targets may reflect the ""fear of escalation and what the US response might be, particularly if the US response affects Russian combat power in some form or fashion,"" the official added. The statements, from an interview with a senior official tasked with keeping a close eye on Russian cyber activity, offer a window into US thinking on Russian hacking at a critical time in the war -- as the Kremlin targets eastern Ukraine after failing to take Kyiv. The official's analysis also reflects the uncertainty and ambiguity of big-power competition in cyberspace, where governments try to keep each other guessing on their hacking capabilities and willingness to use them. ""For Russia, understanding the full scope of US cyber combat power is a gap for them which leaves them unsure about opening this front, at least at this time,"" the senior US official said. ""Cyber warfare is a new domain ... It hasn't been around long enough for any one nation-state to dominate it."" 'Attribution in peacetime is tricky enough' Analysts say Cyber Command has matured considerably since its inception more than a decade ago and has increasingly become a tool of US power projection. The command sent personnel to Ukraine in December, in anticipation of the Russian invasion, to help Kyiv bolster its cyber defenses and to gather information about potential Russian hacking threats, officials have said. There are a range of activities, including low-level intrusions into computer networks, that may qualify as ""offensive"" cyber operations but which the Russians may not necessarily interpret as escalatory, according to Bobby Chesney, an associate dean at the University of Texas School of Law who focuses on cyber and national security law. Some of the command's previous hacking operations have included knocking a Russian troll farm offline during 2018 US midterm elections, according to a Washington Post report, and targeting ransomware operatives who threaten US organizations. While big hacks of US organizations related to the Ukraine war have been in short supply, a plethora of attempted cyberattacks have been reported in Ukraine and Russia as digital vigilantes take sides in the war. The websites of Russian government ministries and media mouthpieces have been knocked offline or altered to broadcast anti-war slogans. The senior US defense intelligence official expressed concern that the Russian government may mistakenly assess that that type of hacking is coming from the US government. ""Attribution in peacetime is tricky enough ... I would say there's a real danger of unintentionally attributing something to the United States that the United States or its allies simply did not do,"" the official said.",20,5.729528697057794,3.2584293508233833,2.4710993462344106,2
2022-06-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/politics/fbi-blames-iran-hospital-cyberattack/index.html,FBI director blames Iran for 'despicable' attempted cyberattack on Boston Children's Hospital,"Iranian government-backed hackers were behind an attempted hack of the Boston Children's Hospital computer network last year, FBI Director Christopher Wray alleged Wednesday, calling it ""one of the most despicable cyberattacks I've ever seen."" The FBI was able to help thwart the hackers before they did damage to the hospital's computer network, according to Wray, but he cited it as an example of the potential high-impact hacking threats that the US faces from the governments of Iran, Russia, China and North Korea. ""We cannot let up on China or Iran or criminal syndicates while we're focused on Russia,"" Wray said in a speech at Boston College. The hack, which took place in June 2021, saw the attackers exploit popular software made by California-based firm Fortinet to control the hospital's computer network, according to US officials. Boston Children's Hospital is a more than 400-bed facility and is considered one of the premier pediatric centers in the US. The FBI got a tip about the Iranian hackers from a ""valued partner within the intelligence community,"" and the activity was thwarted before it was clear what the hackers' end goal on the hospital's network was, according to Joseph Bonavolonta, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston Field Office. ""There was no ransomware deployed,"" Bonavolonta told reporters Wednesday, ""and we were able to work with [the hospital] ahead of time to mitigate any of the other potential associated threats to the network."" Wray had previously said in March that the Iranian government-linked hackers were behind a cyberattack on a children's hospital, but he didn't name the hospital. ""Thanks to the FBI and our Boston Children's Hospital staff working so closely together, we proactively thwarted the threat to our network,"" Kristen Dattoli, a spokesperson for the hospital, said in a statement. Shahrokh Nazemi, a spokesperson for Iran's Permanent Mission to the United Nations, called the FBI claim a ""baseless allegation"" and ""an example of psychological warfare against Iran and thus of no value."" Ransomware and other hacking threats have stalked the health care system for years — and appear to have gotten worse during the coronavirus pandemic. There were 134 publicly reported ransomware incidents involving health care organizations in 2021, up from 106 incidents in 2020, according to threat-intelligence firm Recorded Future. The Boston Children's Hospital incident was one of several that prompted a public warning last November from the FBI and other agencies that Iranian government-backed hackers were targeting a range of organizations across the transportation and health care sectors. The advisory was a rare case of the US government publicly linking Iran with ransomware, which is typically used by cybercriminals rather than governments. But US officials and private analysts have long warned of collusion between foreign governments and criminal hacking groups. When it comes to potential Russian hacking threats to the US, the FBI has been on a ""combat tempo,"" with a 24/7 command post, during the Kremlin's war in Ukraine, Wray added. ""We've seen the Russian government taking specific preparatory steps towards potential destructive [cyber]attacks, both here and abroad,"" he added. Such a ""destructive"" hack — in which data or systems are destroyed — hasn't been reported in the US since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But suspected Russian hackers have conducted a slew of destructive hacks in Ukraine, and US officials are warning businesses to not let their guard down. The same network access gained by Russian operatives to collect intelligence could be used for a destructive hack, Wray warned. ""That's why, when it comes to Russia today, we're focused on acting as early -- as far 'left of boom,' as they say -- as we can."" ""We're watching for their cyber activities to become more destructive as the war keeps going poorly for them,"" Wray said Wednesday.

2022-06-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/ukraine-assistance-biden/index.html,Biden announces new rockets and munitions to Ukraine,"President Joe Biden said Tuesday the US is providing Ukraine ""more advanced rocket systems and munitions"" as its war with Russia grinds on. Writing in a New York Times op-ed, Biden said the US goal is ""to see a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against further aggression."" He said the new shipment of arms would ""enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine."" In a statement a day later, Biden said the US would ""keep providing Ukraine with more of the weapons that they are using so effectively to repel Russian attacks."" He said the new package would include ""new capabilities and advanced weaponry,"" including High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems with battlefield munitions. ""We will continue to lead the world in providing historic assistance to support Ukraine's fight for freedom,"" Biden wrote in the statement. Senior administration officials confirmed to reporters on Tuesday that the US will send Ukraine US-made rocket systems as part of the US' 11th package of security assistance to Ukraine. The officials said the systems that the US is sending Ukraine will be equipped with munitions that will allow Ukraine to launch rockets about 49 miles. That is far less than the systems' maximum range, but far greater than anything Ukraine has been sent to date. The new security assistance package, to be announced officially on Wednesday, will also include air surveillance radars, additional Javelin anti-tank weapons, anti-armor weapons, artillery rounds, helicopters, tactical vehicles and spare parts to help the Ukrainians continue maintaining the equipment, the officials said. Still, Biden sought to spell out clearly what the US aims in Ukraine were and was careful to note the US is not looking to directly engage Russia. ""We do not seek a war between NATO and Russia. As much as I disagree with Mr. Putin, and find his actions an outrage, the United States will not try to bring about his ouster in Moscow,"" Biden said, roughly two months after declaring in Warsaw, Poland, that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power."" The new security assistance comes as Russia has pummeled Ukraine in the east, where the country is outmanned and outgunned, Ukrainian officials have said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly pleaded with world leaders for more arms and equipment. CNN previously reported that US officials were debating for weeks whether to send Ukraine the advanced rocket systems, because they can strike so much further than any weapons they already have. The weapons' long range, technically capable of striking Russian territory, raised concerns that Russia might view the shipments as provocative. ""So long as the United States or our allies are not attacked, we will not be directly engaged in this conflict, either by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine or by attacking Russian forces,"" Biden wrote in the op-ed. ""We are not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia."" Last Friday, a prominent Russian television host warned that the shipment of long-range rocket systems to Ukraine would ""cross a red line"" that would ""provoke a very harsh response from Russia."" But the Biden administration made it clear that it would not send ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems system that can strike deep into sovereign Russian territory. ""I think where the US stands is wanting to provide all of the assistance that we can to the Ukrainians without escalating the situation to a point where the war spills over or, frankly, goes in a terrible direction,"" Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said earlier Tuesday. Meanwhile, the US has accepted some risk to its own readiness with the continued shipment of weapons from Defense Department inventories to Ukraine, Wormuth said, but not a risk that the Pentagon considers too high. ""We have really leaned in to trying to provide everything the policy makers deem essential to get to the Ukrainians. And we have taken some risk to our own readiness -- not an unacceptable level of risk at all, but I think we will continue to do that,"" she said while speaking at an Atlantic Council event about the Army's role in the National Defense Strategy. The President said that US officials ""currently see no indication that Russia has intent to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, though Russia's occasional rhetoric to rattle the nuclear saber is itself dangerous and extremely irresponsible."" ""Let me be clear: Any use of nuclear weapons in this conflict on any scale would be completely unacceptable to us as well as the rest of the world and would entail severe consequences,"" Biden wrote.

2022-05-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/europe/russia-ukraine-genocide-warning-intl/index.html,Exclusive: Leading experts accuse Russia of inciting genocide in Ukraine and intending to 'destroy' Ukrainian people,"Russia's actions in Ukraine provide enough evidence to conclude that Moscow is inciting genocide and committing atrocities intended to destroy the Ukrainian people, according to the first independent report into allegations of genocide in that country. The legal report, signed by more than 30 leading legal scholars and genocide experts, accuses the Russian state of violating several articles of the United Nations Genocide Convention. It warns there is a serious and imminent risk of genocide in Ukraine, backing the accusations with a long list of evidence including examples of mass killings of civilians, forced deportations and dehumanizing anti-Ukrainian rhetoric used by top Russian officials. The report was put together by New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, a US-based think tank, and the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights which is based in Canada, and is set to release on Friday, with the authors sending copies to parliaments, governments and international organizations around the world. An advance copy of the report has been shared exclusively with CNN. ""We assembled top legal experts from around the globe who then examined all the evidence and they came to the conclusion that the Russian Federation bears responsibility for breaches of the Genocide Convention in Ukraine,"" Azeem Ibrahim of the New Lines Institute told CNN. Ibrahim visited Ukraine in March to gather evidence for the report. ""This is a very thorough and detailed examination of extensive evidence,"" he said. ""What we have seen so far is that this war is genocidal in its nature, in terms of the language being used and the manner in which it is being executed. That's very, very clear."" Under the UN Genocide Convention, its signatories have a legal obligation to prevent genocide -- and the report is urging the international community to act. ""We have no time at all, we believe that there is a very serious risk of genocide,"" Ibrahim said. ""Every country that is a signatory to the Genocide Convention, and that's 151 countries including the Russian Federation, every country has to do whatever it can to put a stop to this, otherwise they will also be in breach of the convention."" In one of the most chilling parts of the report, the group makes a direct comparison with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, urging the world to act before it's too late: ""The details of the mass murder of over 7,000 Bosnian Muslim boys and men in Srebrenica only emerged before the international community when it was too late to prevent a genocide that occurred in a matter of days. In 2022, we have the capabilities to accurately track similar atrocities as they unfold and respond accordingly."" The report points finger directly at Moscow, accusing Russia's top officials of orchestrating incitement to genocide and laying the groundwork for future genocide by repeatedly denying the existence of a Ukrainian identity. The Kremlin has forcefully disagreed with President Joe Biden's statement in April that he considered Russia's actions in Ukraine a ""genocide."" The New Lines and Raoul Wallenberg Centre report says the Russian state is breaching Article II and Article III (c) of the Genocide Convention. Article II of the convention states genocide is an attempt to commit acts ""with an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" Article III (c) concerns the ""direct and public incitement to commit genocide."" As examples of the evidence that Russia is breaching the convention, the experts highlight repeated statements made by Russia's President Vladimir Putin who has made it clear he believes Ukraine has no right to exist as an independent state. They also point to the dehumanizing language used by top Russian officials to describe Ukrainians -- including worlds like ""bestial,"" ""subordinate"" and ""filth"" -- as well as their portrayal of Ukraine as a ""Nazi state"" and an ""existential threat"" to Russia. But the report goes further than alleging Russia is intending to commit genocide, accusing Russian forces of carrying out a ""pattern of consistent and pervasive atrocities against Ukrainian civilians collectively"" in the course of the invasion. It says that the well-documented massacres and summary executions in Bucha, Staryi Bykiv, and in Sumy and Chernihiv regions, Russia's deliberate attacks on shelters, evacuation routes and healthcare facilities, as well the indiscriminate targeting and bombardment of residential areas, rapes, sieges, grain thefts and forced deportations to Russia all amount to ""genocidal pattern of destruction."" CNN has independently confirmed many of the atrocities mentioned in the report. The New Lines Institute and Raoul Wallenberg Centre have previously investigated the Rohingya and Uyghur genocides in Myanmar and China respectively, and produced the first report that determined that China's actions in Xinjiang constituted genocide under the Genocide Convention. The team of authors includes David Scheffer, who played a pivotal role in talks establishing the International Criminal Court as the first ever US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues. Canada's former ambassador to the UN Allan Rock and Charles Taku, the lead counsel at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and Special Court for Sierra Leone were also involved. Apart from legal scholars and genocide experts, the team assembled by New Lines Institute also includes open source intelligence investigators, and linguists who examined a communications intercepts and testimonials.",45,6.080343231046921,6.600204621374205,-0.519861390327284,4

The hacking incident in central New Jersey's Somerset County, which began Tuesday, has disrupted services that rely on the county's databases, including accessing land and probate records, the county said in a statement. The ransomware attack has only affected email and IT systems; phone lines and emergency service systems are all working properly, the county said. The hack also affected a web form through which residents can request replacement mail-in ballots for New Jersey's primary election next month. Residents can still call to request a replacement ballot or do so in-person, Nathan Rudy, Somerset County's director of public information, told CNN. Rudy said it would be ""at least until the end of the week"" before the county's digital infrastructure would be fully functional after the hack. It was unclear who was responsible for the hack. Rudy said the FBI was investigating the incident. CNN has requested comment from the FBI. The Somerset County hack is only the latest ransomware incident to hamper local government services in the US, which often struggle with resources to counter hacks. It marks the 22nd US state or local government to be hit by ransomware in 2022, according to Allan Liska, senior intelligence analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future In his first year in office, President Joe Biden exhorted Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in cybercriminals operating from Russian soil, some of whom had allegedly conducted high-profile hacks of US critical infrastructure. While Russian authorities in January detained someone that US officials believe was responsible for the 2021 ransomware attack on US fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline, any bilateral progress on the issue appears to have stalled after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. With many alleged ransomware operatives living in Ukraine and Russia, the jury is still out on how the war in Ukraine has affected the ransomware ecosystem. Senior National Security Agency official Rob Joyce said Wednesday that there had been a decline in ransomware attacks against US organizations since the war began. But gathering authoritative data on ransomware attacks is difficult, as many victims do not report hacks. And US officials and private analysts have warned that the threat of ransomware will remain.",20,7.190184438700287,6.553498349785411,0.6366860889148764,2

The administration is leaning toward sending the systems as part of a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week. Senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometers — much farther than any of the systems Ukraine already has — which the Ukrainians argue could be a gamechanger in their war against Russia. Another system Ukraine has asked for is the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, a lighter wheeled system capable of firing many of the same types of ammunition as MLRS. Russia has in recent weeks pummeled Ukraine in the east, where Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned, Ukrainian officials have said. The Biden administration waivered for weeks, however, on whether to send the systems, amid concerns raised within the National Security Council that Ukraine could use the new weapons to carry out offensive attacks inside Russia, officials said. On Friday, after CNN first reported the news, Russians warned that the United States will ""cross a red line"" if it supplies the systems to Ukraine. ""The US intends to discuss the issue of supplying Ukraine with these weapons as soon as next week,"" Olga Skabeeva, a prominent Russian TV host, said on her high-profile show on the state network Rossiya-1. ""At the present moment, the issue is being addressed by the US presidential administration. So now, we are not even talking about tactical weapons anymore, but about the operational-tactical weapons."" She continued: ""The US MLRS can launch shells over 500 kilometers. And if the Americans do this, they will clearly cross a red line, and we will record an attempt to provoke a very harsh response from Russia."" While Skabeeva does not speak for the Kremlin, her views frequently reflect official thinking. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina responded to CNN's reporting on Twitter Friday, saying he was frustrated the Biden administration has been ""dragging their feet"" on giving Ukraine the rocket systems. On Friday, the Pentagon's outgoing press secretary John Kirby suggested a final decision on the MLRS hadn't been reached yet. ""Certainly we're mindful and aware of Ukrainian asks, privately and publicly, for what is known as a multiple launch rocket system. And I won't get ahead of decisions that haven't been made yet,"" Kirby told reporters during a briefing. The issue of whether to supply the rocket systems was at the top of the agenda at last week's two meetings at the White House where deputy Cabinet members convened to discuss national security policy, officials said. At the heart of the matter was the same concern the administration has grappled with since the start of the war-- whether sending increasingly heavy weaponry to Ukraine will be viewed by Russia as a provocation that could trigger some kind of retaliation against the US. One major hang-up, the sources said, had been the rocket systems' extensive range. The MLRS and its lighter-weight version, the HIMARS, can launch as far as 300km, or 186 miles, depending on the type of munition. They are fired from a mobile vehicle at land-based targets, which would allow the Ukrainians to more easily strike targets inside Russia. Ukraine is already believed to have carried out numerous cross-border strikes inside Russia, which Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny. Russian officials have said publicly that any threat to their homeland would constitute a major escalation and have said that western countries are making themselves a legitimate target in the war by continuing to arm the Ukrainians. Another major concern inside the Biden administration had been whether the US could afford to give away so many high-end weapons drawn from the military's stockpiles, the sources said. Asked on Monday whether the US would provide the systems, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin demurred. ""I don't want to get ahead of where we are in the process of resourcing requirements,"" he told reporters. The administration had similar concerns about providing Ukraine with additional MiG-29 fighter jets, which some worried could allow the Ukrainians to take the fight into Russia. Ultimately, the US decided against backfilling Poland with new jets, which would have allowed the Poles to equip Ukraine with the soviet-era MiGs. The debate about the MLRS is also similar to one that played out before the US decided to begin sending heavier, long-range Howitzers, to Ukraine last month. Weapons packages focused on anti-tank Javelin and short-range Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, as well as small arms and ammunition. At the time, the M777 Howitzers marked a significant increase in range and power over previous systems, but even those top out at around 25 kilometers or 18 miles in range. The MLRS can fire much further still than any of the artillery the US has sent to date. One workaround could be to provide Ukraine with shorter-range rocket systems, officials said, which is also under consideration. It would not take too long to train the Ukrainians on any of the rocket launcher systems, officials told CNN — likely about two weeks, they said. Every drawdown from existing inventories involves a review of its potential effect on US military readiness. With the previous drawdowns, the risk has been ""relatively low,"" said Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley on Monday. The military is watching ""very, very carefully"" to make sure the stockpiles don't drop below levels that create a greater risk, he added. The concern grows significantly with more capable, more expensive systems of which the US does not have as large a supply, the sources said. Pentagon officials met with the CEO of Lockheed Martin last week to discuss supply and ramping up production of the MLRS, one source familiar with the meeting told CNN. The meeting was led by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Bill LaPlante. The UK is also still deciding whether to send the systems, two officials told CNN, and would like to do so in conjunction with the US. Frustration has grown on the Ukrainian side with the US' indecisiveness in recent weeks, because they believe that once the US sends the systems then other countries will quickly follow suit. As recently as this week, the Pentagon had told Ukraine ""we are working on it,"" said one irritated Ukrainian official, who added that Ukraine is asking for an update on the decision ""every hour."" ""We are in great need of weapons that will make it possible to engage the enemy over a long distance,"" Ukraine's top military commander, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said Thursday. ""And this cannot be delayed, because the price of delay is measured by the lives of people who have protected the world from [Russian fascism]."" When Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was asked Thursday what his country's most urgent needs are, he responded: ""If you really care for Ukraine, weapons, weapons and weapons again."" ""My least favorite phrase is 'We are working on it'; I hate it. I want to hear either 'We got it' or 'It's not going to happen,'"" he added. Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, who was part of a congressional delegation trip to Kyiv earlier this month, told CNN he believes the systems could help Ukraine gain significant momentum against Russia. ""I think it could be a gamechanger, to be honest with you,"" Crow said, not only for offensive attacks but also for defense. He explained that Russian conventional artillery, which has a range of about 50km, ""would not get close"" to Ukrainian urban centers if MLRS systems were positioned there. ""So it would take away their siege tactics,"" he said of the Russians. This story has been updated with comments from Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, as well as a Russian TV host on Friday warning the US would cross a red line by sending Ukraine the MLRS, and a tweet from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who criticized the Biden Administration for delaying approval of the weapons",49,5.480026689965914,5.337660195409676,0.14236649455623862,21

The soldier, Vadim Shishimarin, had pleaded guilty to shooting a 62-year-old civilian to death on the fourth day of the conflict in late February. Before delivering the verdict on Monday, the court said that Shishimarin had ""committed a criminal offense"" according to international humanitarian law. ""[Shishimarin] saw a civilian on the pavement, Oleksandr Shelipov,"" the court said. ""Shishimarin knowing that Shelipov is a civilian and is unarmed and does not pose any threat to him -- fired several shots at Shelipov from his AK-gun."" ""The cause of Shelipov's death was a shot in the head that resulted in crushing of the skull,"" the court added. The sentence may be appealed within 30 days. Prosecutor Andriy Sunyuk raised the possibility of more war crimes trials against Russian troops, and said he hoped Shishimarin's conviction could send a message. ""I think that all other law enforcement agencies will move along the path that we have traveled,"" he said. ""This will be a good example for other occupiers who may not yet be on our territory but are planning to come,"" added Sunyuk. ""Or for those who are here now and plan to stay and fight. Or maybe they will think that it's time to leave here for their own territory."" Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin is ""concerned"" about Shishimarin and will seek ways of assisting him. ""Of course, we are concerned about the fate of our citizen,"" Peskov told reporters on a regular conference call. ""We do not have many opportunities to protect his interests on the ground, as foreign institutions actually have no activity [in Kyiv]. But this does not mean that we will not consider the possibility of making attempts through other channels,"" Peskov added, without clarifying which channels he was speaking about. Peskov previously said Russia considers the charges ""unacceptable,"" ""outrageous"" and ""staged."" Speaking Friday, Shishimarin acknowledged he was responsible for the killing but was ""sorry and sincerely repents."" ""I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn't want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,"" he said. Shishimarin's lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, argued that while his client was guilty of killing, it was not murder. ""Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,"" Ovsyannikov said. Ovsyannikov attempted to paint his client and other Russian troops as unwitting pawns in the Kremlin's Machiavellian scheme. The soldiers, Ovsyannikov said, were not aware that their actions would ""result in mass deaths not only of servicemen, but civilians too."" Shishimarin, who appeared in court behind glass wearing a blue-gray top with a shaved head, only spoke on several occasions during the proceedings. He said he was ""fully guilty"" when he entered a plea on Wednesday and, on Thursday he was forced to confront his victim's widow. Shishimarin told her: ""I understand that you will not be able to forgive me, but I am sorry."" The woman questioned the Russian soldier as to why he came to Ukraine, asking rhetorically: ""Did you come to defend us? From whom? Did you defend me from my husband you killed?"" ""We were ordered to come with the column, what will follow I did not know,"" Shishimarin said.",45,6.458624632059494,1.7334455828164892,4.725179049243005,3
2022-05-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/21/europe/ukraine-war-status-intl/index.html,It's nearly three months since Russia invaded Ukraine. Here's where things stand,"It is nearly three months since Russia invaded Ukraine -- a 12-week period in which Russian forces have wrought devastation on the country and its people, resulting in death on a vast scale and causing millions to flee. But the invasion has not been the military success Moscow hoped, and is now deep into its second phase. The bulk of fighting has moved to the east, after failed Russian advances in central Ukraine. The defenders are even focusing on retaking some key areas nearer the Russian border, while Moscow is seeing its troops beaten back in a few key battles. Western aid is also flowing into Ukraine, NATO is set to be strengthened as countries seek to join, and the first Russian soldier accused of war crimes has stood trial. Here's what has happened in several key areas since the war began. Donbas After weeks of intense fighting, Ukraine's eastern Donbas region is ""completely destroyed,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday. He accused Russia of a ""deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible"" after a village in Chernihiv was hit with missiles, leaving many dead. Officials in the region say the front line is being shelled ""day and night,"" with Russian forces attempting to break through Ukrainian lines. A NATO military official told CNN Wednesday that the alliance expects something of a stalemate over the next few weeks. But the official said NATO believes momentum has shifted significantly in favor of Ukraine and the debate within NATO circles is now over whether it is possible for Kyiv to retake Crimea and the Donbas territories seized by Russia and Russian-backed separatists, respectively, in 2014. Kharkiv Ukrainian forces have beaten back Russia's assaults in Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, and advanced toward the border in several places north and east of the city. Ukrainian officials said last week they were liberating villages on the outskirts of the city. Their advances led to the symbolic and embarrassing expulsion of the Kremlin's forces back to their own border while posing the strategic threat of cutting Russia's supply lines into Ukraine and its forces further south in Donbas. Anastasia Paraskevova recently returned to her home in Kharkiv for the first time since fleeing the city two months ago. It had been under constant bombardment since then, until Russian forces were repelled. Paraskevova said overall the experience was good. ""The city was much more alive. People were walking the streets. And some shops were working. It felt like some life was back, much better than it was when I was here in March."" Kherson Every day, hundreds, or even thousands, of people are trying to flee the Russian-occupied region of Kherson in southern Ukraine. The city has been under Russian control since early in the invasion. Ukrainians are leaving for many reasons: to avoid being detained or to escape the heavy-handed actions of Russian forces, or because of the chronic shortages of medicine and other basics in Kherson, which fell under Russian control soon after the invasion. Last week, a convoy of about 1,000 vehicles tried to leave Kherson. The Russians ultimately let the convoy move in batches -- but only after holding it in one place for most of the day. Mariupol Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, finally fell to Russian forces after weeks of relentless bombardment. The city was the scene of some of the most intense fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater where hundreds of civilians had sought refuge from the violence. Mariupol became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as its defenders held out at Azovstal, a sprawling steelworks plant where as many as 1,000 civilians had taken shelter at one point, with stocks of food and water dwindling. Ukraine's military announced late Monday that its forces had completed their ""combat mission"" at Azovstal, effectively ceding the city to Russian forces. On Friday, Ukraine ordered its forces to stop defending the plant. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered at Azovstal. CNN cannot independently verify that figure. With the city now almost fully under Russian control, there is concern that evidence of any potential war crimes -- like those allegedly committed in Bucha and Borodianka -- could be lost or destroyed. Bucha More evidence of potential Russian war crimes is emerging in Bucha, the northern Ukrainian city near Kyiv, the capital. An investigation by The New York Times alleged that Russian paratroopers carried out summary executions of at least eight Ukrainian men in Bucha on March 4. Evidence of mass graves and civilian executions in the towns of Bucha and Borodianka has continued to emerge since early April, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region. Images of bodies lying strewn the streets of Bucha have sparked international condemnation and fueled calls for an investigation into potential Russian war crimes. CNN visited the scene of mass graves in Bucha in April after Russian forces had withdrawn, revealing the horrors of their occupation to the world. Correspondent Fred Pleitgen was among the first to reach a mass grave that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling. A soldier stands trial This week saw the start of the first war crimes trial in Ukraine since the invasion began. A 21-year-old Russian soldier named Vadim Shishimarin pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed 62-year-old man. The trial's first day was so packed with journalists that authorities in Kyiv were forced to move to bigger venue. It has since produced several dramatic moments, including a confrontation between the soldier and the victim's widow and testimony from Shishimarin himself. Speaking Friday, Shishimarin acknowledged he was responsible for the killing but was ""sorry and sincerely repents."" ""I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn't want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,"" he said. Shishimarin's lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, argued that while his client was guilty of killing, it was not murder. ""Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,"" Ovsyannikov said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Russia has no details about Shishimarin's case and it considers the charges ""unacceptable,"" ""outrageous"" and ""staged."" Diplomats return Foreign diplomatic missions started coming back to life in Kyiv this week, after diplomats fled the city en masse at the beginning of the conflict. The US flag was raised over the United States Embassy to mark the official resumption operations on Wednesday, while the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Thursday it would also reopen its embassy. The US and France both began sending back diplomats to Kyiv in late April. A massive aid package US lawmakers passed a bill Thursday that will send roughly $40 billion to Ukraine to pay for military and humanitarian aid, including funding that will assist Ukrainian military and national security forces, help replenish stores of US equipment sent to Ukraine and provide public health and medical support for Ukrainian refugees. US President Joseph Biden signed the aid package while he was in South Korea. Nordic developments Russia stopped sending natural gas to Finland Saturday, just days after it and Sweden applied to join NATO. Helsinki and Stockholm had, for decades, avoided joining the alliance, but cited Moscow's invasion as the ultimate impetus to do so now. The two countries formally handed in their applications Wednesday. Most NATO members appear ready to support both bids, except for Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that his country ""will say no to Sweden's and Finland's entry into NATO,"" citing their support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK seeks an independent state in Turkey and has been in an armed struggle with Ankara for decades. It has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Some experts say Erdogan may be angling for concessions or to highlight grievances Turkey wishes to bring to the attention of the international community.",45,4.792917016454988,3.2233672433207996,1.569549773134188,3
2022-05-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/europe/bucha-ukraine-reported-killings-intl/index.html,New York Times: Investigation reveals potential war crime in Bucha involving Russian forces,"Russian paratroopers executed at least eight Ukrainian men in the town of Bucha on March 4, in what appears to be a potential war crime, according to a New York Times investigation published Thursday. Based on eye-witness testimonies and three videos obtained and analyzed by The Times, the investigation details the alleged execution of eight Ukrainian men by Russian paratroopers occupying Bucha in early March. The timeline of the incident is established by two videos analyzed by the paper, which appear to capture Russian paratroopers leading a group of Ukrainian men at gunpoint to a Russian-held office building, where their bodies would later be found. Several eyewitnesses The Times spoke with -- including one of the men involved in the incident who was shot but managed to survive -- allege an execution-style killing took place in the moments that followed. A drone video filmed one day after the alleged incident appears to corroborate the events, as it shows two Russian soldiers guarding several dead bodies outside the same office building, according to the NYT analysis. ""I was shot and I fell down. The bullet went into my side,"" said Ivan Skyba, whom the Times identifies as a 43-year-old builder. ""I fell down and I pretended to be dead,"" he said. ""I didn't move and didn't breathe,"" he told the Times. The Times identified the soldiers involved as paratroopers based on an analysis of their equipment from CCTV footage captured in early March, when Russian forces still occupied Bucha, along with evidence left behind at the Russian-held office building where the shootings occurred. Based on translated text messages, interviews with local authorities, family members and witnesses, The Times investigation identified eight of the men who were executed in the March 4 incident. According to the investigation, all had joined local paramilitary groups in Bucha in the days before they were killed. None of the videos in the report have been reviewed or verified by CNN, and the victims' identities have not been corroborated. Evidence of mass graves and civilian executions in the towns of Bucha and Borodianka has continued to emerge since early April, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region. Images of bodies lying strewn the streets of Bucha have sparked international condemnation and fueled calls for an investigation into potential Russian war crimes.

Correspondent Fred Pleitgen was among the first to reach a mass grave that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling. During a visit to Bucha and Borodianka in mid-April, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan said there were ""reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC"" were being committed in both towns. But Khan also warned that it would be ""challenging"" to guarantee justice would be served in Ukraine, given Russia's decision to withdraw its signature from the ICC statute, which gives the court jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Russia also doesn't extradite its citizens to other countries. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the mass killings of civilians in Ukraine, while reiterating baseless claims that images of bodies on the streets of Bucha are ""fake."" The New York Times reported that the Russian Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense did not respond to their request for comment. CNN has also contacted those ministries. Khan addressed Russia's claims of disinformation directly. ""Those bodies that are in those bags on the screen are not fake. I've seen them. I stood beside them. The issue is how did they die, who is responsible and in what circumstances?"" Khan said, adding that the world was watching to see how ""effective the rule of law"" would be regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",45,1.254965990136159,4.728179875526732,-3.4732138853905727,3
2022-05-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/politics/pro-russia-disinformation-report/index.html,"Pro-Russia online operatives falsely claimed Zelensky committed suicide in an effort to sway public opinion, cybersecurity firm says","Pro-Russia online operatives falsely claimed weeks into Moscow's war against Ukraine that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had committed suicide, as part of an aggressive effort to dent public morale and undermine the Ukrainian government, US cybersecurity firm Mandiant said Thursday. The false Zelensky suicide claim is just one of several information operations tracked by Mandiant from suspected Russian and Belarusian actors that were aimed at deceiving audiences in Ukraine, Russia and elsewhere in Europe -- or at least muddling the truth about the brutal war. The influence campaigns, analysts say, underscore how the Kremlin is committed as ever to information warfare and efforts to shape perceptions of the conflict even as its soldiers suffer heavy losses on the battlefield. In another case, Belarus-linked operatives falsely asserted that a Polish crime ring was harvesting the organs of Ukrainian refugees, with the complicity of Polish officials. ""The proliferation of Russia-aligned information operations, in both scale and tempo, suggests the importance that Russia places on shaping the information environment,"" Alden Wahlstrom, a senior analyst at Mandiant, told CNN. ""We've observed known actors leverage longstanding campaign assets and infrastructure to target Ukraine during the invasion, using capabilities they've invested in developing over time."" Mandiant did not directly point the finger at the Russian government for the fake Zelenksy suicide narrative but described the activity as a ""suspected Russian influence campaign."" For decades and dating back to Soviet times, disinformation and other so-called ""active measures"" have been a key part of Russia's foreign policy strategy, according to scholars. Facebook and YouTube in March removed a widely disseminated ""deepfake,"" or digitally altered, video purporting to show Zelensky asking Ukrainian troops to lay down their arms. The real Zelensky appeared in a video shortly afterward saying the defense of Ukraine continued. At least some of the disinformation analyzed by Mandiant appeared to gain little online traction. And Ukrainian citizens and soldiers show no signs of letting up in their resistance to the Russian invasion. Suspected Russian operatives, for example, planted false statements ""on a very limited number"" of websites and blogs that Zelensky had killed himself in a military bunker in Kyiv in March, according to Mandiant. The Russian government has falsely portrayed its invasion of Ukraine as a ""de-Nazification"" campaign despite the fact that Zelensky is Jewish. The fake suicide story bears some resemblance to how Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler died in 1945, by suicide in a bunker as Soviet troops advanced. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington and the Belarusian Foreign Ministry on the Mandiant research. With the eyes of the world on Ukraine, other world powers have moved to influence public opinion about the war or sow discord among their rivals. One pro-Iran information operation impersonated a Russian journalist and published tweets claiming that Israeli intelligence supported Ukraine against Russia on the eve of the war, according to Mandiant. It was an apparent attempt to increase intensions between Russia and Israel. The Israeli and Iranian governments are bitter enemies. The US government has tried to shape public perceptions of the Ukraine war in its own ways, including by setting up a State Department account on Telegram, a messaging app popular with Russians.",20,4.457906876577116,3.505078143134467,0.9528287334426491,19
2022-05-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/europe/russia-bloggers-ukraine-criticism-intl-cmd/index.html,Setbacks in Ukraine trigger rare criticism of Russia's war effort by Russian bloggers,"The Russian army's performance in Ukraine has been less than impressive according to Western intelligence assessments -- and that viewpoint is gaining ground among some in Russia itself. Three Russian military bloggers have suddenly launched into damning criticism of the operation, and especially the debacle of a failed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets river last week. The three bloggers combined have more than three million subscribers on Telegram. A prominent former officer who regularly appears on state television also weighed in with a gloomy view of Russia's military prospects in Ukraine. Such public criticism of the military operation in Ukraine is very rare. The Kremlin insists the campaign is on schedule. The carping appears to have been triggered by a catalog of setbacks, the worst being the disastrous attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets crossing last week. Satellite imagery shows at least 70 Russian armored vehicles and tanks were destroyed and hundreds of soldiers may have been killed. On the evening of May 12, prominent Russian military correspondent Yuri Kotenok reposted accounts and images of the failed crossing, including one from a Ukrainian source. Kotenok, who has nearly 300,000 subscribers to his Telegram channel, reposted one account that castigated the Russian officer responsible and blamed him for crowding so many vehicles in a small area by the river. In response to criticism from some subscribers, Kotenok retorted: ""If you want fairy tales, then you have come to the wrong place. In such a case you should go to officialdom."" He said his role was ""to provide with correct assessment, to speak good of the good, and bad of the bad, but to say the TRUTH."" Kotenok even had a dig at Russian television coverage. ""If you want to sit in a warm bath and 'fight' softly and soothingly, then you are welcome to the television. There you will find a lot of things for the delight of your ears and eyes,"" he said. The correspondent has been on the frontlines of other conflicts and said that he carried shrapnel in his body, before concluding: ""In war it happens that we suffer losses. Know this and ... be silent if you have nothing to say in essence."" Calls for change Several other popular Telegram accounts in Russia picked up the theme. In a series of posts, blogger Vladlen Tatarskiy blamed the Russian commander of the operation. ""Until we find out the name of this 'military genius' who wasted the BTG [battalion tactical group] near the river and he publicly answers for this, there will be no reforms in the army,"" he wrote. ""The offensive in the Donbas is being hampered,"" he said, ""not only due to the lack of effective intelligence from UAVs [drones], but also due to such generals."" He said he'd been warning for 18 months that Russian forces lacked both strike and reconnaissance drones. Tatarskiy told CNN that he was not criticizing the entirety of what the Kremlin calls Russia's ""special military operation"" but ""individual episodes,"" and he still believed Russia would achieve its goals in Ukraine. ""I will personally make every effort to it,"" he added, speaking to CNN by text message. Nevertheless, he also called for broad change. ""All the areas need to be improved,"" he said. ""Each war reveals some drawbacks, shortcomings, or false experiences, experiences that need to be adjusted to the modern realities. So absolutely all spheres need reform,"" said Tatarskiy. Another Telegram blogger sharing his views goes by the name ""vysokogovorit,"" and has nearly 400,000 subscribers. ""Didn't the commander of the crossing at Bilohorivka have information that in the third month of the war, it was not permissible to move in large convoys, and let alone to accumulate them in a narrow fire-swept area in front of a water barrier?"" he posted. ""How much of an idiot do you have to be to not understand this? Although this may not be idiocy, but direct sabotage."" Vysokogovorit said he'd been part of a river crossing near Izium. ""So I know what I'm talking about."" Blogger Yuriy Podolyaka, who has more than two million subscribers, echoed the criticism and later posted that the Russian Defense Ministry had conducted an analysis of the pontoon bridge disaster and that lessons were being learned. CNN cannot verify his claim. The outbursts from such popular Telegram channels were as brief as they were unexpected. All three accounts quickly returned to familiar themes such as alleged atrocities of the Ukrainian army. But the fact that they even aired such views and have not been taken out of circulation has surprised some observers. 'Informational sedatives' Doubts about the course of the Russian operation have even emerged on one of state television's flagship shows. On Monday's edition of Rossiya One's 60 Minutes, retired colonel Mikhail Khodarenok warned that ""the situation for us will clearly get worse."" Khodarenok rejected the claim that the Ukrainian armed forces are in crisis and on the verge of a ""moral collapse"" -- describing such propaganda as ""informational sedatives."" ""To put it mildly, this is not true,"" he said. Despite pushback from the show's presenter, Khodarenok estimated that Ukraine could arm one million people. And with the US Lend-Lease military aid program beginning soon, he said, along with European assistance, ""we really need to treat this million Ukrainian soldiers as a reality in the near future."" Ukrainian soldiers' morale is more important than their training, he insisted. ""The desire to defend their motherland as they understand it in Ukraine very much exists,"" he said. ""Ultimately victory on the battlefield depends on the high morale of troops who are spilling blood for ideas they are ready to fight for,"" Khodarenok added -- possibly hinting at continuing reports of low morale in some Russian units in Ukraine. Khodarenok also took a critical view of Russia's broader situation. ""We are in total geopolitical isolation, the whole world is against us but we don't want to admit it,"" he said. ""As far as China and India are concerned, their support for us isn't so unconditional."" Another critical voice is a former commander in the separatist Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) militia, Igor Strelkov -- who was the DPR's self-proclaimed minister of defense when the Malaysian airliner MH17 was allegedly shot down by men under his command in 2014. Still influential in the DPR, Strelkov wrote Monday that ""the widely advertised late-April and early-May operation to defeat the Donetsk group of the enemy has FAILED."" In a long screed, Strelkov said that ""only tactical successes have been reached. Not a single large locality has been liberated...It's clear now that by early summer Donbas will not be fully liberated."" Strelkov, whose Telegram channel has nearly 400,000 followers, said that the Russian high command was too obvious in its approach and lacked any element of tactical surprise. Besides ""individual examples of 'outstanding lunacy'"" -- such as the attempt to cross the river, Strelkov said that ""the losses incurred in daily offensive battles (that do not end with the enemy's defeat) cannot be quickly compensated by trained replacements."" ""No one knows where [Ukraine] will strike and when our troops will finally run out of steam (although this can also be predicted which I'm not going to do),"" he added pessimistically. These rare voices of criticism in Russia and the DPR almost certainly do not portend any change of strategy on the part of the Kremlin, but their airing as Ukraine presses a counteroffensive in the northeast is in stark contrast to the monopoly of the state over media coverage of the invasion.",7,3.8990284539789677,5.485489270647422,-1.5864608166684544,13

Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert with experience working on Ukraine and Russia issues, was tapped to helm the ""Disinformation Governance Board"" earlier this month. The interagency team was meant to coordinate department activities related to disinformation aimed at the US population and infrastructure. But Jankowicz's appointment quickly drew condemnation from GOP lawmakers and right-wing media, who pointed to her past tweets and statements regarding Hunter Biden's laptop and Christopher Steele, the author of the so-called Steele Dossier. Jankowicz told CNN on Wednesday evening that she resigned because the board's future was uncertain. ""I had hoped we would be more transparent about how the board was going to operate and what it was going to do,"" she said, acknowledging that the new initiative should have been rolled out differently. ""For whatever reason, that didn't happen, and that information vacuum only grew. And I think the information vacuum kind of directed a lot of the attacks and digging around in my personal life."" Some attacks, she said, were vicious and targeted her family and DHS engaged its Federal Protective Service to monitor threats against her online. The Washington Post first reported on the suspension of the disinformation board and Jankowicz's resignation. The situation, Jankowicz told CNN, was ""frustrating and saddening"" because she had gone into the job ""with the intention of serving the American people and bringing my expertise to bear to protect us from threats that affect all of us."" Asked about the criticism that she was overly political in some of her tweets, Jankowicz said that her comments had been taken out of context. ""All of the attempts to just decontextualize things I've written, and remove any nuance from them, just shows exactly how these disinformation campaigns work,"" she said. Review of the board DHS and the White House had previously defended the new initiative, and backed Jankowicz to lead it. In a statement, a DHS spokesperson said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has asked former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff and former US Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick to lead a review of the board through the Homeland Security Advisory Council. During that review, the board's work will be paused and it will not convene. ""The Board has been grossly and intentionally mischaracterized: it was never about censorship or policing speech in any manner. It was designed to ensure we fulfill our mission to protect the homeland, while protecting core Constitutional rights,"" the spokesperson said. ""However, false attacks have become a significant distraction from the Department's vitally important work to combat disinformation that threatens the safety and security of the American people."" Ultimately, Jankowicz told CNN she resigned because she wasn't sure whether the board had a future after the ""debacle"" of the last few weeks. She said she was ""deeply disappointed,"" though, by the administration's announcement that it will conduct a ""review"" of the board, because she believes it should continue even in her absence. The board was ""simple"" and ""anodyne,"" she said, and largely revolved around coordinating efforts within DHS to combat misinformation related to threats to public safety, like natural disasters. Jankowicz has focused on disinformation and Eastern Europe for years and advised the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on the subject in 2016 and 2017, according to her website. She is fluent in Russian, and her book ""How to Lose the Information War"" examines how five Western governments have dealt with Russian disinformation. Despite her expertise, critics argued she held biases on certain issues. For instance, in a TikTok video posted prior to her appointment to lead the board, Jankowicz singled out Rudy Giuliani and TikTok influencers to a Mary Poppins jingle. DHS previously said Mayorkas asked department officials to enhance the public's trust in the group. The board is an internal working group and doesn't have operational authority, instead serving in a more advisory role. It's intended to gather best practices and support counter-disinformation activities, not monitor Americans, according to DHS. Rollout drew criticism The concept of the board dates to last year. At the time, Homeland Security officials began discussing a group to provide guidance on policies and privacy protection questions, given that agencies within the department were already collecting information for purposes related to their missions, said John Cohen, the former acting head of the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, in an interview with CNN earlier this month. One of the questions the working group could help with, officials thought, was whether agencies could share information with one another that they had obtained through their own authorities, Cohen said. Mayorkas acknowledged that some of the criticism of the board was brought on by the department's own rollout. ""We probably could have done a better job of communicating what it does and does not do,"" he said earlier this month in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash. The ""Disinformation Governance Board"" focuses first on disinformation surrounding human migration into the US and potential disinformation threats from Russia aimed at US critical infrastructure, DHS said in a news release announcing the board. Russian disinformation campaigns against Americans have gone on for years, including during election cycles. US officials are always watching for new signs of Kremlin-backed efforts to sow divisions, particularly in light of Russia's war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, US challenges in dealing with migrants trying to enter the US are exacerbated by smugglers who ""make a profit by spreading false information that endangers lives,"" DHS said in its news release.

2022-05-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/politics/us-air-force-hypersonic-missile-test/index.html,US Air Force tests troubled hypersonic missile,"The US Air Force carried out a successful test of its troubled hypersonic missile over the weekend, one month after announcing the program had suffered delays because of ""recent flight test anomalies."" The Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon was successfully released from a B-52H bomber off the coast of Southern California on Saturday and attained hypersonic speeds, the Air Force announced on Monday, without releasing any more details about the test itself, such as the duration of the flight or its altitude. ""This was a major accomplishment by the ARRW team, for the weapon enterprise, and our Air Force,"" said Brig. Gen. Heath Collins, the Air Force's program executive officer for weapons. The ARRW is a hypersonic weapon that uses a booster rocket to accelerate the missile to speeds in excess of Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. A hypersonic glide vehicle then separates from the booster and glides at high speed toward its target. The Air Force has struggled with the testing of the AGM-183A ARRW in the past, and the program suffered three flight test failures before this latest success. Last month, the Air Force said that flight test anomalies had pushed back the schedule for the weapon's completion. The first complete test of the missile and booster rocket was delayed until sometime in the next fiscal year, which begins in October. One day before this test, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall acknowledged the problems that the ARRW program has encountered. ""The program has not been successful in research and development so far,"" Kendall told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. ""We want to see proof of success before we make the decision about commitment to production, so we're going to wait and see."" The Pentagon has placed an increased emphasis on hypersonic weapons development after lawmakers became concerned that the US was falling behind the Chinese and Russian programs. Last year, China successfully tested a hypersonic weapon that orbited the globe before hitting its target. More recently, Russia became the first nation ever to use hypersonic weapons in war when it launched its Iskander and Kinzhal missiles at Ukraine. The Pentagon said that Russia has used between 10-12 hypersonic weapons since the beginning of its invasion of Ukraine. In mid-March, the US successfully tested its Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC), but kept it quiet to avoid escalating tensions with Russia as President Joe Biden was about to visit Europe. The HAWC was launched from a B-52 bomber off the west coast in the first successful test of the Lockheed Martin system. A booster engine accelerated the missile to high speed, at which point the air-breathing scramjet engine ignited and propelled the missile at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5 and above. The test came days after Russia says it used its own hypersonic missile during its invasion of Ukraine, claiming it targeted an ammunition warehouse in western Ukraine. Even with the increased focus on hypersonic weapons, the Air Force secretary urged a note of caution about their importance. ""What we want to look at is what's the most cost effective mix of weapons,"" Kendall told lawmakers. ""There is certainly a role for hypersonics in that, and we need to invest in that and procure them in some quantities, but there's still an open question in my mind about what's the most cost effective mix.""",49,8.338907923053583,5.098344495544004,3.2405634275095787,12
2022-05-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/politics/ufo-sightings-congress-hearing-what-matters/index.html,Why the military wants to hear about more UFO sightings,"Future President Gerald Ford was the top Republican in the House when he forwarded tips about UFO sightings to the Air Force in 1966. The Air Force sent an astrophysicist, J. Allen Hynek from Northwestern University, to Michigan to investigate. ""Swamp gas"" was Hynek's ""flippant"" explanation, according to a frustrated press release Ford issued, demanding a congressional investigation into UFOs. The investigation never happened. And if you want to go down the rabbit hole of what Hynek saw and whether it was actually swamp gas, this Michigan Radio report is worth the click. Today, the military is being very careful not to appear flippant about UFOs. In fact, the number of UFO sightings logged by the US government near government property is on the rise, a US Navy Intelligence official told lawmakers on Tuesday in the first public congressional hearing on UFOs in more than 50 years. ""Reports of sightings are frequent and continuing,"" Deputy Director of Navy Intelligence Scott Bray told members of the House Intelligence Committee. Remove the stigma of UFO sightings. Call them UAPs Bray said the military has worked hard to remove the stigma around reporting UFOs, which they refer to as ""unexplained aerial phenomena,"" or UAPs. There's a process, introduced in 2019, for Navy pilots and other military personnel to reporting a sighting. Guidelines are posted in the cockpits of military aircraft. ""The message is now clear: If you see something, you need to report it,"" Bray said. Read CNN's full report on the hearing from congressional reporter Clare Foran. Or watch the hearing on YouTube. An official office of UAP inquiry The Pentagon recently created a dedicated office to ""facilitate the identification of previously unknown or unidentified airborne objects in a methodical, logical and standardized manner,"" according to another official, Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie. Critics of the office, such as Luis Elizondo, the former head of an informal UFO review within the military that helped spark new official interest, have worried that the emphasis on intelligence will cut down on transparency and accountability. Sightings are on the rise When the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a landmark report on UAPs in 2021, it referred to 144 reports from government sources. That figure now exceeds 400, Bray said, although many of those reports are from previous years and most lack the documentary evidence that might be needed for a more thorough investigation. Evidence is hard to come by Bray showed several videos to lawmakers: one featuring a few frames of a fast-moving UAP that has not been identified, and two featuring triangle-shaped lights recorded by camera through night vision goggles. The government now thinks it's an illusion of light passing through the goggles and into the camera that created the triangular shape. The idea behind this new UFO openness is the government wants to better understand unexplained objects to make sure they don't represent some new and threatening technology. ""Any object that we encounter can likely be isolated, characterized, identified and, if necessary, mitigated,"" Moultrie said. Most objects can be explained UAPs often end up being weather balloons or new technology. But there is a bin of unexplained incidents that require more study, Bray said. Both officials said they are committed to transparency. ""Our goal is not to potentially cover up something,"" Moultrie said. But they're not exactly committed to total openness and talked about a balance between transparency and what Moultrie called ""preserving our warfighting advantage."" Classified briefing to follow That's a gaping and subjective loophole. Conspiracy theorists will worry the lawmakers heard the really juicy stuff at a classified hearing later Tuesday. There is certainly now agreement that there's danger in the unexplained. ""Unidentified aerial phenomena are a potential national security threat, and they need to be treated that way,"" said Rep. André Carson of Indiana, the Democratic lawmaker who convened the hearing. The top Republican at the hearing said he'd rather hear about hypersonic weapons the US knows is being developed by China and Russia, but UAPs are a worthy topic too. ""Inasmuch as this topic may help us better understand unknown activities of Russia and China, I am on board,"" said Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas. More disclosures across the intelligence community Moultrie argued there's a movement toward more disclosures in the intelligence community. I think Moultrie was referring to the disclosure of intelligence about Russia's plan to invade Ukraine when he said the following: ""Just over the last three or four months I think that the intelligence community and the national defense apparatus have disclosed more info on various events than it has in probably the previous 10 years."" A long way from Project Blue Book Even this appearance of transparency is a very different approach to UAPs than the secretive government UFO sighting program of the '40s, '50s and '60s. Specifically, Project Blue Book, run by the Air Force, is what launched a million conspiracy theories. Think Roswell, New Mexico. Project Blue Book was shuttered in the late '60s after 12,618 sightings were reported and 701 remained unexplained. Read about it at the National Archives website. The program was expensive, and none of the reported UFO sightings were shown to be a national security threat, according to the Air Force. Tic Tac video helped reignite inquiries When the catalog of recent UAP sightings was released by the Director of National Intelligence in 2021, CNN's Anderson Cooper talked to retired Navy Lt. Commander Alex Dietrich. She was one of the pilots who witnessed a UAP in November 2004. It was recorded on grainy video in the famous ""Tic Tac"" video (the object was white and oval). It moved in unexpected directions at shocking speed and had no visible means of propulsion. See the Tic Tac video. Watch Cooper's interview with Dietrich. And read some possible terrestrial theories for what it might be in this San Diego Union-Tribune report. Dietrich described ""interrogation-style"" interviews with the Office of Naval Intelligence after that sighting. But she said it was important for people who see unexplained things to come forward, so that experts can study and explain them. ""I'm trying to reduce the stigma for other air crew -- so that if they see something, or when they see something, they'll say something. And that they will not feel embarrassed or ashamed to make the reports ... and that they'll contribute to this data pool of information that we have.""",20,3.184021135828411,6.340114700240907,-3.1560935644124957,12
2022-05-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/europe/mariupol-battle-over-russia-control-cmd-intl/index.html,The fall of Mariupol could conceal war crimes evidence from the world and give Russia's offensive a boost,"After almost three months of intense bombardment, thousands of reported deaths and countless tales of horror and starvation, the battle for the city of Mariupol is nearing its conclusion. Ukraine's military announced late Monday that its forces had completed their ""combat mission"" at the sprawling Azovstal steelworks plant, which was for weeks the last major holdout in a city otherwise occupied by Russian troops. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers were evacuated from the facility and efforts were underway to evacuate those still inside. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, has been the scene of some of the most intense fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in late February. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater where hundreds of civilians had sought refuge from the violence. Now there are fears that evidence of further atrocities may be lost forever. Before the Kremlin took control of Mariupol, the city council accused Russian forces of trying to erase evidence, using mobile crematoria to dispose of bodies and identifying witnesses to any ""atrocities"" through filtration camps. CNN could not verify that claim. ""Murderers are covering their tracks,"" the council alleged. The Kremlin has denied many of these claims, including using filtration camps to cover up wrongdoing and targeting civilians in Mariupol. A symbol of resistance Mariupol became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance during weeks of relentless Russian attacks. While most of the city had already fallen, its defenders held out at Azovstal, where as many as 1,000 civilians had taken shelter at one point. Ukrainian officers described a bleak situation inside the steel plant, as stocks of food and water dwindled and hundreds of wounded were stranded without proper medical care. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that ""tens of thousands"" have died in Mariupol, while the regional military governor last month said those killed numbered as many as 22,000 -- though death tolls are difficult to verify in the fog of war. Mariupol's mayor has estimated that 90% of the city's infrastructure has been damaged, 40% of it beyond repair. Images of Mariupol's destruction have become symbols of the Kremlin's use of indiscriminate firepower in Ukraine, drawing stark visual parallels with the leveling of cities like Syria's Aleppo or the Chechen capital of Grozny. Controlling Mariupol is key to Russian efforts to take the wider Donbas region -- beyond the separatist-controlled territories -- according to Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military with the Washington-based Center for a New American Security. ""It's unrealistic to declare control of the Donbas without actual control over its major cities,"" he told CNN in an email last month. Kofman said the fall of Mariupol should free up manpower and logistics for the Kremlin's campaign in the rest of Donbas. But keeping the city under Moscow's thumb will also take substantial resources. Russia likely needs all the troops it can muster for its offensive in eastern Ukraine, where it has refocused its military efforts after pulling back from other parts of the country. Artillery fire and air strikes are continuing along the front lines in Luhansk and Donetsk, but the Ukrainian military says it is repelling Russian attempts to gain territory. Analysts say Russian forces simply tried to flatten Mariupol to make it easier to control -- especially given the history of the man put in charge of Russia's war effort, Gen. Alexander Dvornikov. Dvornikov led a division in the Kremlin's pacification campaign in Chechnya from 2000 to 2003 and headed Russia's forces in Syria from 2015 to 2016. In both cases, the Russian military left destruction in its wake, bombing civilian areas with little regard for casualties. ""He basically annihilated and obliterated the second-largest Syrian town of Aleppo. And his strategy was simply to bombard anything that was alive, target civilian infrastructure -- hospitals and schools -- and then basically take over what was left,"" said Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow at the UK-based think tank Chatham House. ""It is a similar strategy we are already seeing in Mariupol,"" she said last month, while the fighting was still ongoing. Ukraine's military intelligence has already accused Dvornikov of overseeing war crimes against the civilian population in Mariupol in the course of the siege. A full accounting Of the 450,000 people who lived in the city before the war, a third had already left by mid-April, according to Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko. Only 100,000 residents remain, and those who have fled bring with them the horror stories of war. Some residents who managed to leave the city have said they were ordered by Russian forces to evacuate to Russia through so-called ""filtration camps"" -- a practice that sparked painful memories of Joseph Stalin's forced relocation of millions of people to remote parts of the Soviet Union. Russian forces have also reportedly at times barred citizens from leaving. Many said they took shelter in basements for days on end to hide from the unrelenting artillery fire. One resident previously told CNN he was in a line waiting for fresh drinking water when a blast killed three people in front of him, including one who was decapitated. The Kremlin has denied many of these claims, including using filtration camps to cover up wrongdoing and targeting civilians in Mariupol. But Russian forces are already moving quickly to clean up some of the areas worst affected by their offensive, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the Mariupol mayor. ""Surprisingly, the plan to clear the debris coincides with the places of greatest destruction ... the drama theater, Myru Avenue, and now suddenly it is the hospital,"" said Andriushchenko, referring to hospital number three, which was heavily bombed in March. Video of the aftermath of the bombing showed heavily pregnant women being taken from the hospital; at least one later died. A Telegram channel that appears to be linked to the new Russian-backed administration in the city has announced that temporary employment is on offer ""gathering up the dead"" as well as in city improvements. A full accounting of the devastation there may be impossible as the city comes under full Russian control. The extent of the alleged war crimes committed in liberated northern Ukrainian cities, such as Bucha and Borodianka, only became apparent after Russian forces had fled. Those in Mariupol could have been subjected to the same kind of abuses. If the city remains under Moscow's control, a true record of what happened there may be lost to history.",47,5.995178838432521,2.947724908005014,3.047453930427507,24
2022-05-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/europe/azovstal-siege-halt-mariupol-intl/index.html,The battle for Mariupol nears end as Ukraine declares 'combat mission' over,"Ukrainian forces have completed their ""combat mission"" in Mariupol, according to a statement by the country's military, bringing the months-long battle for the besieged city close to an end. Commanders of units stationed at the city's massive Azovstal steelworks plant have been ordered ""to save the lives of their personnel,"" the statement by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine added. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Monday from the steel plant, the last holdout in a city that had become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance under relentless Russian bombardment. Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar described the evacuation operation in a separate video statement, noting that some Ukrainian forces remain at Azovstal. ""Fifty-three seriously injured people were evacuated from Azovstal to a medical facility in Novoazovsk for medical care,"" she said. ""Another 211 people were taken to Olenivka through the humanitarian corridor."" An ""exchange procedure"" will see the evacuees eventually brought home, Malyar also said. According to Malyar, the defense of Mariupol meant Russian forces were not able to transfer about 20,000 personnel to other regions of Ukraine, and thus failed to capture Zaporizhzhia. Also on Tuesday, Malyar told journalists that the evacuation was the only way Azovstal's defenders could be rescued. ""Unfortunately, military unblocking is impossible in this situation. There could be no other way to rescue them than the way it is happening now. It was the only way out,"" Malyar said during a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine. Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's deputy prime minister, also said that Ukraine expects to carry out an exchange of Russian prisoners of war for the severely injured soldiers evacuated from Azovstal. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the fighters who left the plant will be treated in accordance with international law, adding on a regular conference call that Russian President Vladimir Putin allowed both civilians and the military to leave Azovstal after the troops laid down their arms. The Russian Investigative Committee said it would interrogate what it described as ""the surrendered militants"" in a statement published Tuesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the evacuation in a statement Monday, thanking the Ukrainian military and negotiators, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations. ""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,"" he said. ""The 82nd day of our defense is coming to an end. A difficult day. But this day, like all others, is aimed precisely at saving our country and our people,"" Zelensky said. The Russian Defense Ministry had earlier said that a ceasefire had been established to allow the passage of wounded Ukrainian servicemen, according to state news agency RIA Novosti. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, has been the scene of some of the most intense fighting in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion in late February. Many civilians have already been evacuated. But Ukrainian fighters in the city had, in April, vowed to ""fight until the end,"" despite being surrounded, low on ammunition and outnumbered by Russian forces. Russian TV network RT on Monday showed video of around 10 to 12 buses leaving the steel plant. The buses appeared to be a mixture of hospital and ordinary transport, some marked with a red cross. In her statement, Malyar credited ""the defenders of Mariupol"" for gaining Ukraine ""critical time to form reserves, regroup forces and receive assistance from partners."" ""Unfortunately, we do not have the opportunity to unblock Azovstal by military means,"" she said. The country's Azov Regiment on Monday also issued a statement saying ""the entire Mariupol garrison"" was following orders to save lives. ""In order to save lives, the entire Mariupol garrison is implementing the approved decision of the Supreme Military Command and hopes for the support of the Ukrainian people,"" the Azov Regiment said in a statement late Monday. ""The defenders of Mariupol fulfilled the order, despite all the difficulties, and distracted the overwhelming forces of the enemy for 82 days.""",47,4.300957515288765,3.301458206526121,0.999499308762644,24
2022-05-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/politics/us-intelligence-review-ukraine/index.html,US intelligence community launches review following Ukraine and Afghanistan intel failings,"The US intelligence community is carrying out a sweeping internal review of how it assesses the fighting power of foreign militaries amid mounting pressure from key lawmakers on Capitol Hill who say officials have failed twice in one year on the two major foreign policy crises faced by the Biden administration in Ukraine and Afghanistan. The Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday sent a classified letter to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Defense Department and the CIA pointing out that the agencies broadly underestimated how long the Ukrainian military would be able to fend off Russian forces and overestimated how long Afghan fighters would hold out against the Taliban last summer after the US withdrawal from the country, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. They questioned the methodology behind the intelligence community's assessments, and the underlying assumptions behind them, the sources said. CNN has learned that one smaller intelligence agency within the State Department did more accurately assess the Ukrainian military's capability to resist Russia. But while that assessment was shared within the US government, it did not override the wider intelligence community's predictions. Critics say the US might have moved to arm Ukraine sooner and with heavier weaponry if the intelligence community had assessed that it stood a fighting chance against the Russian army. In the days leading up to the war, the intelligence community told policymakers that Kyiv would likely fall within three to four days of a Russian invasion. ""I think there was a major issue that we missed that had a significant influence on how this has unfolded. And had we had a better handle on the prediction, we could've done more to assist the Ukrainians earlier,"" Sen. Angus King, an independent of Maine, said during a tense exchange with a top defense intelligence official in a public hearing on Tuesday. Taken together, the review and the push from Capitol Hill suggest a widespread acknowledgment within the US government that the intelligence community needs to reassess how it judges the strength of other nation's militaries -- and underscore how high the stakes are when officials miss the mark. ""In this case, where you are making an assessment more or less in the present of something that turned out to be pretty dramatically wrong -- that's a good reason to do a serious postmortem,"" said Greg Treverton, a former chairman of the National Intelligence Council under President Barack Obama. In Ukraine, officials broadly believe that the intelligence community gave too much weight to Russia's conventional military advantages and failed to account for how important Ukraine's will to fight would be to the conflict. Only one intelligence agency appears to have accurately predicted that the Ukrainian resistance would be far more effective than most believed, multiple people familiar with the assessments told CNN: the State Department's intelligence arm, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. The department's intelligence directorate was also the lead dissenting voice in 2002, when the majority of US intelligence agencies assessed wrongly that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq war in 2003 -- widely regarded as a catastrophic foreign policy blunder. A senior State Department official told CNN that one tool driving the department's high confidence in a Ukrainian resistance campaign was basic opinion polling: analysts reviewed a steady stream of public polls, particularly from eastern Ukraine, throughout the fall of 2021 and into 2022 that showed growing anti-Russian sentiment, the official said, and a growing Ukrainian willingness to engage in armed combat. Other intelligence agencies, meanwhile, had largely focused on how dramatically outgunned Ukraine was by the Russian military. On paper, Russia had an overwhelming advantage in terms of weaponry, equipment and manpower. No one, it appears, anticipated how poorly Russia would execute their initial campaign. Despite being more optimistic about Ukraine's effectiveness, the State Department's intelligence arm also overestimated Russia's military capabilities, the official said. Defense Intelligence Agency Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier said during the public hearing on Tuesday that the two-month-old conflict is now in ""a bit of a stalemate."" The intelligence community has been widely praised for the accuracy of its insights into Russian planning leading up to the invasion. But its ability to predict the unknowable -- in this case, how the war would play out once Russian and Ukrainian troops began fighting -- has historically been spotty. So-called ""will to fight"" is among the most difficult intangibles for intelligence to predict, former officials say, and it has failed time and again: in Vietnam, in Iraq, and now, in Afghanistan and Ukraine. The intelligence community's review, which predates the letter from the Senate committee, is using Ukraine and Afghanistan as case studies to try to better understand what indicators officials should be using to predict how successful a foreign military will be when faced with enemy fire. ""I would say that it's a combination of will to fight and capacity,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said during the public hearing on Tuesday. ""The two of them are issues that are ... quite challenging to provide effective analysis on and we're looking at different methodologies for doing so."" How they got it wrong Intelligence officials have defended their work in the lead-up to the war in Ukraine, arguing that the bulk of their predictions were accurate and that the assessment that the Ukrainian military would collapse and Kyiv fall to Russia within a matter of days was justifiable based on the information available to the United States at the time -- primarily data on the amount of manpower and equipment possessed by both militaries, and years of study of Russian military doctrine. Russia surprised many US officials by appearing to ignore their own military doctrine, marching on Kyiv in a massive column without first softening the city with overwhelming airstrikes. It was an unpredictable opening move that senior intelligence officials have publicly attributed in part to a mistaken belief by Russia that it would be treated as a liberator by the local population. Berrier, the Defense Intelligence Agency head, told lawmakers that because the Russians massively outgunned the Ukrainians at the outset of the conflict, ""it was the thought of senior analysts that it wasn't going to go very well for a variety of factors. But there was never an intelligence community assessment that said the Ukrainians lacked the will to fight."" ""Yeah, but there wasn't an assessment that they did either,"" King snapped back. ""The assessment was Ukraine would be overrun in a matter of weeks. That was grossly wrong."" The State Department's more optimistic assessment of Ukraine's capabilities was shared within the US government, the senior official said. And despite its relatively obscurity and size compared to the CIA, DIA and other better-known intelligence agencies, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research often bats above its weight in interagency discussions, current and former officials say. ""They get paid attention to because they're good and they tend to be contrarian, which is also good,"" Treverton said. ""Often they're contrarian and right."" But just because an administration is presented with a given assessment does not mean that it will act on it. In the case of Afghanistan, some intelligence assessments had held that the US-backed government in Kabul would be able to withstand the Taliban for at least a year, long enough for the US to complete its withdrawal and evacuation. But assessments varied within the intelligence community, with even some public Defense Department reports hinting that the US-backed Afghan military would be unlikely to hold together long in the face of Taliban attack, and it quickly became clear that the Biden administration had relied on the wrong assessments of fighting power. After the Taliban takeover of Kabul, President Joe Biden pinned the defeat in part on the collapse of the Afghan military -- ""sometimes without trying to fight."" The administration had vowed to get the United States out of Afghanistan and it's not clear that a better assessment of the Afghan army's fighting power would have led the Biden administration to make dramatically different policy decisions. But some critics on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have argued that better predictions about how quickly the Taliban would overrun the US-backed Afghan military might have allowed the administration to engineer a less chaotic final departure. In reality, US audiences were shocked by images of desperate Afghans hanging off of the outside of departing C-17s and the death of 13 US service members in an ISIS suicide bombing at the airport. Human factors Current and former intelligence officials acknowledge that only looking at military ""capabilities"" leaves out the quintessentially human factors that could prove decisive. Assessing a population's will to fight is an art, not a science, that defies purely data-driven analysis, the senior State Department official said. But, the official said, it is a key element to determining how successful a military will be in a fight. ""The basic challenge is, you can see what you can count: so you know something about the armaments they have and you can maybe see something about the training they have,"" said Treverton. ""But the things that matter are all intangible,"" he said. ""You just don't know how good they're going to be and how willing they're going to be to fight. I've never seen us have much by way of a good method for doing that."" And in fact, it is a focus on softer political indicators that may have allowed the State Department to reach a more accurate conclusion in Ukraine that the military-focused Defense Department or the broader intelligence community, Treverton, the State Department official, and other sources suggested. ""The IC makes assessments based on what it collects. DOD makes assessments based on what it knows about militaries. But State has people who have spent entire careers on the ground, firing diplomatic relationships and so they understand the mentality of the people and the culture,"" said one source familiar with the assessments. ""That matters when it comes to assessing resistance."" The State Department official said that the department is well positioned to analyze ""will to fight"" given its inherent emphasis on cultural and historical context. The combative exchange between King and Berrier hinted at deep-rooted concern amongst lawmakers that US intelligence is missing those key human indicators.

2022-05-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/europe/russia-ukraine-drone-satellite-pontoon-bridges-cmd-intl/index.html,A meandering river in eastern Ukraine is hindering both sides in the war,"The war in Ukraine will soon be three months old. Russia's forces are still well short of the minimum objectives set out by President Vladimir Putin and in many areas the front lines are beginning to look static. But after weeks of intense bombardment, the Ukrainians' defensive lines in the east are also degraded. Essentially, two battlegrounds are emerging. The Russians are adding combat power to their drive to take the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. The Ukrainians are trying both to hold them back and to cut them off. It's a three-dimensional chessboard of military calculation. And the natural boundaries shaped by one river in eastern Ukraine are already affecting the progress of each side. Russian forces have taken territory -- but in modest amounts. Many of their gains, especially in the south, came in the early days of the invasion, and they have tried to consolidate those. At the epicenter of the conflict -- in the industrial belt of Luhansk region -- they have resorted to blanket bombardment. As one Ukrainian official put it: ""The Russians do not change tactics: They destroy cities and only then enter the scorched earth."" Russian ground forces are -- for now -- taking no more than incremental territory, while anecdotal reports speak of poor discipline and morale among some units. Russia still has just under 100 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) in Ukraine, according to US officials, and another 20 just over the border. Each BTG has about 1,000 soldiers, but US officials assess that many have been degraded by more than two months of conflict. In Luhansk and Donetsk -- the goals of Russia's ""special military operation'""-- no city has yet fallen into Russian control beyond Mariupol. That may be about to change after weeks of remorseless shelling of the industrial belt of Luhansk, a string of towns that includes Severodonetsk and Rubizhne. It now seems that Ukrainian resistance in Rubizhne is effectively over. Left behind is a landscape of rubble, without water, power or people. Its occupiers -- mainly Chechen fighters and the militia of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic -- inherit a wasteland. But the loss of Rubizhne does make neighboring Severodonetsk, which was a city of 100,000 people before the invasion and where 15,000 now cower in basements, more vulnerable. And if Ukrainian resistance there is no longer tenable, new defensive lines will be needed to impede a Russian advance westwards. However, the Russian offensive from the north has been much less successful. Which is where the meandering Siverskyi Donets comes into play. The river starts in Russia and flows into Ukraine, forming swamps, floodplains and oxbow lakes, cutting through chalk cliffs as it goes. In other words: a nightmare for a military assault. The Russians have tried and apparently failed to put several pontoons across the river in an effort to encircle Ukrainian troops. Satellite imagery analyzed by CNN shows at least three bridges were destroyed this week and the Russians sustained heavy losses. Further west, the Russians do appear to have crossed the river -- but it's too early to tell if that's in sustainable and sufficient numbers. In the last month, since occupying Izium, they have made only limited progress despite the stretched Ukrainian lines. And their strategic goal -- Sloviansk -- has defenses in depth. To sustain an offensive in this area, the Russian military needs supplies, and they must come from across the border. The supply line runs from Belgorod to the Ukrainian rail hub of Kupiansk and further south. Ukrainian forces seem determined to disrupt this funnel and have made progress in retaking territory to the north and east of Kharkiv. In the first instance, this has reduced Russian fire on the city itself. And in some places Ukrainian units are now in sight of the Russian border, and have Russian supply lines within artillery range. Video geolocated by CNN showed that several top-of-the-line Russian T90M tanks were destroyed as Ukrainian units pushed east towards the Siverskyi Donets. They now control the town of Staryi Saltiv, according to a CNN team that was in the deserted town Thursday. Again the river is a natural obstacle -- and in this area it might hamper further Ukrainian progress. But the Ukrainian counter-offensive has already led the Russians to pull some units back to protect their western flank and hold as many as 20 BTGs back in Belgorod. As Mick Ryan, a former US major general puts it, the Ukrainians ""have placed Russia commanders upon the 'horns of a dilemma' as they slowly deplete their combat power in the east."" But Ryan doesn't expect a more ambitious Ukrainian offensive, which would sap already stretched resources. ""The Ukrainians will probably continue their continuous 'nibbling away' at the Russians to seize back their territory, rather than a general offensive on all fronts,"" he tweeted. The south: A very different war The picture is less dynamic in the south, where the front lines have moved little. The Russians still control a substantial belt of farmland in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, but their efforts to move further north have been sporadic. In Kherson, for example, public unrest has subsided -- partly because an estimated 45% of the region's population is reported to have left. The Russians continue to launch cruise missile attacks on Odesa and other coastal regions, without much purpose beyond terrorizing the civilian population and with little ""operational design"" in military language. Any effort to attack the city from land or sea seems very implausible, especially since the sinking of Russia's guided-missile cruiser, the Moskva. US intelligence discounts any imminent prospect that Russian forces would try to seize all of Ukraine's coast. That would likely require a full mobilization inside Russia, a step Putin has so far not ordered. Instead, the Russians seems intent on consolidating their control over a land corridor running from the border to Crimea and trying to ""integrate"" Kherson into the ""Russian world"" by introducing Russian passports, the ruble and a puppet administration. But their proxies are ruling over areas in grim conditions, with healthcare and utilities severely impaired. And there is plenty of evidence that Russian units are treating the region as a candy store, stealing everything from tractors to museum artifacts. As yet there is no serious effort at governing. A war of attrition Few expect a knock-out blow by either side in the coming months. A war of attrition looks more likely as the weapons supplied by the US and its allies tilt the balance on the battlefield. The first American howitzers on now on the front lines. The US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, said this week that ""as both Russia and Ukraine believe they can continue to make progress militarily, we do not see a viable negotiating path forward, at least in the short term."" ""The uncertain nature of the battle, which is developing into a war of attrition, combined with the reality that Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia's current conventional military capabilities, likely means the next few months could see us moving along a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory."" Perhaps the greatest risk for Ukraine is that a war like this -- along essentially the same fronts that we see today -- would be sustainable, if tough, for Russia. However, it would hammer the Ukrainian economy, which is already expected to shrink by 45% this year, according to the World Bank. Putin could then wait for an opportunity to take a further bite out of a country that he believes has no right to exist. There is the additional risk -- if not yet evident -- that the West's sense of urgency in backing Ukraine with cash and weapons might wane should the conflict settle into stagnation. Remember Syria. But the course of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has already defied most expectations. The time is approaching when critical decisions -- or mistakes -- by either side may well influence its outcome. In the words of the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu: ""The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.""",7,2.090395645494999,6.193882323626333,-4.103486678131334,13

It will focus on a Pentagon program that was established last year after the US intelligence community released a preliminary assessment on 144 reports of ""unidentified aerial phenomena'' since 2004 -- and could explain only one. The House Intelligence Committee's subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation will hold the public hearing on May 17 at 10 a.m. ET. It will be followed by a closed, classified hearing on the Pentagon program, known as the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group. The two witnesses are Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security Ronald S. Moultrie and Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott W. Bray. ""The American people expect and deserve their leaders in government and intelligence to seriously evaluate and respond to any potential national security risks -- especially those we do not fully understand,"" said Indiana Democratic Rep. André Carson, the chairman of the subcommittee holding the hearing, in a statement. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, added that the hearing would ""give the public an opportunity to hear directly from subject matter experts and leaders in the Intelligence Community on one of the greatest mysteries of our time, and to break the cycle of excessive secrecy and speculation with truth and transparency."" The New York Times first reported on the hearing. In a briefing on Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that the Defense Department will try to ""make sure we have a better process for identifying these phenomena, analyzing that information in a more proactive, coordinated way than it's been done in the past."" He said the Pentagon will also attempt to ""mitigate any safety issues"" that arise since ""many of these phenomena"" are reported near training areas. But Arkansas GOP Rep. Rick Crawford, the top Republican on the relevant House Intelligence subcommittee, called into question the Democrats' move to hold the hearing considering other national security concerns. ""With China and Russia developing hypersonic weapons and the Biden administration leaking alleged US military operations in Ukraine, we have far more serious intelligence threats than flying saucers,"" Crawford said.

2022-05-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/10/politics/ukraine-russia-cyberattack-satellite-blinken/index.html,US and European allies blame Russia for cyberattack on satellite provider as Ukraine invasion began,"The US, European Union and the UK have blamed Russia for a hack that knocked out internet service for tens of thousands of satellite modems in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe at the onset of Russia's invasion on February 24. ""The United States is joining with allies and partners to condemn Russia's destructive cyber activities against Ukraine,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Tuesday. The cyberattack on a satellite network owned by US-based telecommunications firm Viasat is one of the most consequential cyber incidents of the war in Ukraine. It disrupted communications in Ukraine an hour before Russia's full-scale invasion, according to an EU statement, and the collateral damage included knocking thousands of wind turbines offline in Germany that relied on the satellite network. A top Ukrainian cyber official, Victor Zhora, on March 15 called the hack ""a really huge loss in communications in the very beginning of the war."" The primary target of the hack ""is believed to have been the Ukrainian military,"" the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said Tuesday. Blinken's statement also blamed Russian military hackers for a series of data-wiping hacks on Ukrainian government agencies and companies prior to and after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The hacks before the invasion may been an attempt by the Kremlin to extract concessions from the Ukrainian government, according to Microsoft analysts. The State Department on Tuesday also offered further details on how the US government is trying to help Kyiv ward off a barrage of suspected Russian hacks. Contractors for the US Agency for International Development are ""providing hands-on support"" to Ukrainian government agencies and critical infrastructure to identify malicious software and bring systems back online, the department said. Meanwhile, the FBI has been briefing Ukrainian officials about Russian intelligence services' hacking operations and receiving leads on cyber threats for the FBI to investigate, according to the State Department. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington. The cyberattack was ""yet another example of Russia's continued pattern of irresponsible behaviour in cyberspace, which also formed an integral part of its illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine,"" the European Council, said in a statement.",20,5.707681064689545,6.172609386066,-0.4649283213764548,2
2022-05-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/europe/victory-day-russia-ukraine-war-analysis-cmd-intl/index.html,Putin has put himself at the center of Russia's Victory Day. But he has little to celebrate,"President Vladimir Putin takes Russian anniversaries seriously. It was no coincidence that his invasion of Ukraine came a day after Defender of the Fatherland Day, a celebration of Russia's military achievements. It was on that same occasion in 2014 that Putin took the first step in annexing Crimea from Ukraine, through orchestrated pro-Russian protests on the peninsula. The leader had clearly hoped to have more to celebrate by this Victory Day on Monday, the country's most patriotic of dates, marking the Soviet Union's role in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II. It was on May 8, 1945, (May 9 in Moscow's time zone) that Germany signed its Instrument of Surrender in Berlin, ending the fighting in Europe. The USSR suffered the biggest losses of any nation -- around 27 million soldiers and civilians died. Russia's justification for war in Ukraine suggested a deadline for success by Victory Day. Putin and his government have repeatedly said the aim of their so-called ""special operation"" is to ""denazify"" Ukraine, and that freeing the country of Nazis is a matter of Russian survival. It's an argument that has no real weight; a blatant cover for Russian revanchism. Even though the Kremlin's well-oiled propaganda machine has been going at full steam since the February invasion, it will be difficult for Putin to twist Russia's losses into true victory on Monday. If anything, the operation in Ukraine has been an embarrassment for him -- at least on the international stage. Russia's military outsizes Ukraine's by every measure -- even with the heavy weapons the West is sending in -- yet it failed to take territory in the north, let alone the capital, Kyiv, and is struggling to make gains even in the east, where it is now focused. Ukraine's armed forces claim that Russia has lost more than 24,000 troops in just over two months, and more than 1,000 tanks, over 2,600 armored vehicles and hundreds of aircraft. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers, and there are likely to be heavy losses on the Ukrainian side too. Still, it's undeniable that Russia military is weakened. Russia's guided-missile cruiser the Moskva -- once the crown jewel of its Black Sea fleet -- is now a wreck, sitting destroyed in the depths of the sea. Meanwhile, Putin's foes in the West, whom Russia had tried so hard to divide over years, are increasingly united, all for the cause of ensuring victory for Ukraine. Emily Ferris, a research fellow with the Royal United Services Institute, said that Russia's failures had been largely logistical. ""Some of the logistical problems they had were partly because they never really managed to take major railway hubs at all, frankly, in the whole country,"" Ferris told CNN. ""And because the Russian motorized ground forces rely on the railways to move all of their troops, their hardware and their tanks. Because they never really managed to control those hubs, they never really managed to push particularly far into Ukrainian territory, and it meant that they then had to rely on off-road capabilities."" Russian forces instead moved by trucks and slow-moving tanks, many of which were bogged down in mud, as warmer weather prevented the ground from freezing and allowing freer movement, Ferris said. ""Then it meant that it was tricky to tow the tanks back to Russia for repairs, because they were far away, and so a lot of them were abandoned. Lots of their equipment started breaking because the tanks can only take so much moving around,"" she said. ""And, of course, you have the very well-documented resistance from local Ukrainians, who didn't take too well to being occupied."" Even in the east, where Russian forces are trying to advance through the Donbas region, their gains have been limited. Pro-Russian rebels have been installed in the self-declared separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk for years, but still, Russia hasn't annexed those areas, and its forces are struggling to get through a stiff Ukrainian resistance in big cities. ""We're still talking about huge amounts of territory -- Ukraine is massive -- even if they are just focusing on the east and the south. Some of the claims from senior commanders that they're going to be establishing a land corridor across the south of Ukraine, it's still a huge task,"" Ferris said. ""The fact that they've not been able to take major cities and major rail hubs before is still a problem. I think that's going to persist."" An alternate universe Sitting in Russia, however, it's easy to think that the war is going to plan. Russian propaganda is flooding the media, which is almost entirely state-controlled, but in March the government also passed a law making ""false news"" about the military illegal, a crime that comes with a maximum 15-year jail term. As a result, the antiwar protests that happened in Russia in the early weeks of the invasion have all but ended. And the media is largely complying with the new law. Indeed, Russia is pushing ahead with force. It's in the midst of a prolonged battle in the southeastern port city of Mariupol, where its forces are intensely shelling a huge steel plant that it has failed to seize. If the plant falls, the city is more or less in their hands. Intelligence reports show that Russia could be planning to annex Luhansk and Donetsk ""sometime in mid-May"" and could also declare and annex a so-called ""people's republic"" in the southeastern city of Kherson, according to US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Michael Carpenter, who spoke to reporters on Monday. Any advancements are amplified in Russian media, where the messaging of success is very clear, Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political analysis firm R. Politik, told CNN. ""The message is that Russia is moving according to plan and everything is going as it should, that there are some gains. Russia has declared that it took Mariupol, and so everything is going according to the plan,"" she said. That messaging is filtering through to the Russian people effectively, according to Levada Center polls, which show that not only do the vast majority of Russians support the war, but 68% of Russians think the operation is proceeding successfully. Putin's popularity has also soared to 82%, after remaining stubbornly in the 60s since the Covid-19 pandemic hit right up until February, the month of Russia's invasion. Polling in Russia must be taken with a grain of salt, however, given people are subject to a stream of propaganda and dissent is not tolerated. Stanovaya added that there was an additional narrative in state media that Russia is the victim in this war and that the country is acting defensively. ""When you're watching Russian TV for several days, you can really start believing that we are in a huge danger of Ukrainian Nazis. That we are vulnerable, that we should, we must get up and protect ourselves, otherwise it's a matter of Russian existence,"" she said. Putin doesn't even need to use Monday to declare any kind of victory, Stanovaya argued. He will just need to bank on the anti-Nazi emotions of the holiday to consolidate his justification for war. The world waits As Russians will be listening in on Putin's Victory Day speech, so too will global leaders and observers, eager to learn where Putin might take his war next. There has been much speculation, but as always with the Russian President, no one really knows. There's a growing sense of nervousness that with so little to show the world -- if not Russians -- more than two months into the war, Putin may double down on his ""special operation."" UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace even suggested last week on a UK radio station that Putin may drop his guise of a ""special operation"" and outrightly declare war. Doing so could trigger a huge mobilization of Russian fighters, even civilian conscripts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday dismissed Wallace's suggestion as ""nonsense."" But if Russia's military continues to deplete at the rate it is, it's not impossible that Putin will make that decision at some point. Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he thinks Putin's original plan was to declare victory and an end to hostilities on Monday. ""But it is obvious that the war is dragging on, and Putin's plan is not getting any clearer. But he must make some symbolic or practical gesture,"" he said, speaking to CNN from Moscow. ""Everyone here is scared that he will announce a partial or full mobilization. Although such a measure might prove unpopular: the Russians have become militarists, but they are lazy militarists, sofa troops."" While Victory Day is about World War II, it has also become a source of legitimacy for Putin, who has found ways to associate himself with the day, said Kolesnikov, who accuses the leader of simplifying the historical details and ""turning the celebration into a pompous ritual."" In the Putin years, the mythology around World War II has metamorphosized. Historians note it glorifies Soviet sacrifice, while downplaying Stalin's willingness to squander human lives. It glosses over the darkest chapters of the war: The USSR's pact with Nazi Germany that served as a prelude to war; the wholesale deportation of entire populations deemed untrustworthy by the Soviets; and mass rapes by Soviet soldiers in occupied Germany during the waning days of the war. Even a grassroots parade known as the ""Immortal Regiment"" to honor those who died in the war has been co-opted by the government. Putin now routinely leads marches himself. Stalin -- who refused to believe Adolf Hitler's army would invade the Soviet Union when it did --- is increasingly being celebrated as a hero on May 9, not as the leader who was caught off guard in the 1941 German attack. ""Of course, the new generations do not really understand the significance of the holiday,"" Kolesnikov said. ""Those who do understand and know history are horrified by the way Putin has privatized it."" And on Monday, the significance of May 9 may change yet again, depending on what Putin has to say.",7,5.926756919622318,4.558611207067752,1.3681457125545657,23
2022-05-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/politics/ukraine-assistance-joe-biden/index.html,Biden announces $150 million security package to Ukraine,"President Joe Biden on Friday announced additional security assistance to Ukraine in the form of ""additional artillery munitions, radars, and other equipment."" The latest package is for $150 million worth of equipment including 25,000 155mm artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars, jamming equipment and field equipment and spare parts, a White House official said. The new security assistance package follows the President's $33 billion proposal last week to Congress to support Ukraine amid Russia's invasion. The US has made it clear it intends to provide long-term support to Ukraine and has already provided the nation with billions of dollars in military and humanitarian assistance. The proposed package last week was more than twice as much as the $13.6 billion infusion of military and humanitarian aid that Congress approved last month. In a statement, Biden said the administration has nearly exhausted funding that can be used for security assurance and called on Congress to approve his request for additional money for Ukraine. ""With today's announcement, my Administration has nearly exhausted funding that can be used to send security assistance through drawdown authorities for Ukraine,"" the statement reads. ""For Ukraine to succeed in this next phase of war its international partners, including the US, must continue to demonstrate our unity and our resolve to keep the weapons and ammunition flowing to Ukraine, without interruption."" ""Congress should quickly provide the requested funding to strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,"" Biden added. Biden is set to speak with other G7 leaders virtually on Sunday ahead of expected ""Victory Day"" celebrations in Russia, which takes place each year on May 9. Victory Day is a prominent holiday on the Russian calendar that marks the Nazi surrender in World War II and is typically celebrated with a huge parade of troops and weaponry across Red Square in front of the Kremlin. Reuters was first to report on the upcoming assistance package. The President said the $33 billion package would provide more artillery, armored vehicles, anti-armor systems and anti-aircraft capabilities to the Ukrainian military, as well as humanitarian assistance, including food, water, medicine and shelter to Ukrainians displaced by the war. The package includes more than $20 billion for military and security assistance. The US remains in close coordination with European allies. The President last week said the US was working with other nations -- including Korea, Japan and Qatar -- to support European allies being threatened by Russia suspending their natural gas supplies. The President has also proposed strengthening US law enforcement capabilities to seize property linked to Russia's kleptocracy. The goal is to further pressure Russian oligarchs and use money from their seized assets, including superyachts, to fund Ukraine's defense. The ratcheting up in military assistance from the US comes as Russia refocuses its campaign to seize new territory in the country's eastern region. The President recently said Russia's war has entered a ""critical window,"" making Western military aid all the more essential.

2022-05-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/05/politics/us-intelligence-russian-moskva-warship-ukraine-target/index.html,US provided intelligence that helped Ukraine target Russian warship,"When Ukraine successfully targeted Russia's prized warship last month with anti-ship cruise missiles, it had some help from the United States. Ukrainian forces, having spotted the Russian warship in the Black Sea, called their American contacts for confirmation that it was in fact the Moskva, sources familiar with the events told CNN. The US responded that it was, and provided intelligence about its location. It is not clear whether the US knew Ukraine would move to strike the ship, however, and the US was not involved in that decision, the sources said. ""We routinely and have now for weeks been sharing information and intelligence about Russian units, both at sea and ashore, to help the Ukrainians defend themselves against this invasion. And we're going to continue to do that,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told CNN's Brianna Keilar on ""New Day"" Friday and reiterated his earlier statement. Kirby had previously told CNN: ""We did not provide Ukraine with specific targeting information for the Moskva. We were not involved in the Ukrainians' decision to strike the ship or in the operation they carried out. We had no prior knowledge of Ukraine's intent to target the ship. The Ukrainians have their own intelligence capabilities to track and target Russian naval vessels, as they did in this case."" Asked Friday if US intelligence has resulted in Russian deaths, Kirby said, ""I am not going to get into the specifics about the intelligence that we provide."" He added: ""The intelligence that we provide to Ukraine is legal, it's lawful, it is legitimate, and it is limited. And we're very careful about what we share and when we share it."" The ship sank after it was struck by two Ukrainian cruise missiles on April 14, dealing a huge blow to the Russian military. The episode, first reported by NBC News, reflects the Biden administration's increasingly forward-leaning posture when it comes to sharing intelligence with Ukraine, part of a broader policy shift toward helping Ukraine defeat Russia decisively on the battlefield and significantly weaken its military. But it also raises questions about what the red lines are for the US and Russia when it comes to US military support to Ukraine. The US has for months provided Ukrainian forces with intelligence about Russian troop movements inside Ukraine, including intercepted communications about Russian military planning. It also provides Ukraine with maritime awareness information to allow the country to better understand the threat posed by Russian ships in the Black Sea, many of which are firing missiles onto Ukrainian territory. There are also clear limits, however, to what the US will share, multiple sources told CNN. For example, the US has so far declined to provide information to Ukraine about potential targets inside Russia itself. And while the intelligence the US shares about Russian troop movements inside Ukraine can include details like vehicles and types of personnel at a particular location, the US has not provided Ukraine with intelligence about specific Russian military leaders' whereabouts, officials have said. ""We do not provide intelligence on the location of senior military leaders on the battlefield or participate in the targeting decisions of the Ukrainian military,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters on Thursday. Kirby added that ""Ukraine combines information that we and other partners provide with the intelligence that they themselves are gathering on the battlefield, and then they make their own decisions, and they take their own actions."" Following a series of military and logistical setbacks, Moscow has most recently concentrated efforts on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which has been on the front line of the Russia-Ukraine conflict since 2014. Heavy fighting continued on Thursday inside the Azovstal steel complex, according to Lt. Col. Denys Prokopenko, a Ukrainian commander at the plant. He claimed the Russians had broken their pledge to allow civilians to leave through evacuation corridors Thursday. There are thought to be between 200 and 300 civilians still inside the plant, including 30 children. Since Sunday, it has been bombarded from land, sea and air. ""For two days now, the enemy has broken into the territory of the plant. There are heavy, bloody battles,"" Prokopenko said.

Weapons shipments have continuously arrived along NATO's eastern flank where they are picked up by Ukrainian personnel and brought into the country by rail or truck. Forces in European Command have also begun training small numbers of Ukrainian forces outside of the country on key systems such as towed artillery. NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu confirmed on Twitter later on Tuesday that the alliance's North Atlantic Council had approved Cavoli's nomination to be Supreme Allied Commander Europe.

2022-05-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/politics/joe-biden-alabama-ukraine/index.html,Biden tells Alabama workers making anti-tank missiles they 'make it possible' for Ukraine to fight Russia,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday told workers in Alabama that the anti-tank missiles they're making at their facility are making possible the Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion and keeping US fighters out of the war. It's a trip that would have seemed far-fetched to Biden's own advisers one year ago, visiting a weapons-making facility in ruby-red Alabama. But 69 days into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the trip was especially timely. Biden, who last week urged Congress to authorize a $33 billion aid package, toured and delivered remarks from the sprawling Lockheed Martin manufacturing facility in Troy, which sits on 4,000 acres and is the final assembly plant for Javelins, the anti-tank missiles that have been critical to Ukraine's defense because they are lightweight systems that can be operated by one person and hit targets more than two miles away. In his remarks, the President repeatedly credited workers for contributing to supplying weapons in the war in Ukraine, drawing parallels to defense production efforts during World War II. ""We know that the United States is leading our allies and partners around the world to make sure that the Ukrainians who are fighting of the future of the nation have the weapons and the capacity and ammunition and equipment to defend themselves against (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's brutal war. A lot of war crimes being committed,"" Biden said. Workers in the facility, the President said, ""make it possible"" for Ukrainian forces ""to have a shot."" ""You're making a gigantic difference for these poor sons of guns who are under such enormous, enormous pressure and firepower,"" he told the crowd. The President suggested the war marks the first fight of what he has long called a generational battle of autocracy versus democracy, saying facility workers are central toward arming nations with democratic values. ""Because of you, in this first -- really -- battle if you will ... to determine whether that's gonna happen, it's because you're making it possible. You're making it possible for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves without us having to risk getting in a third world war by sending in American soldiers fighting Russian soldiers,"" Biden said. He continued, saying, ""You're allowing the Ukrainians to defend themselves and, quite frankly, they're making fools of the Russian military in many instances. A big part of the reason they've been able to keep up fighting and to make this war a strategic failure for Russia, is because the United States together with our allies and partners have had their back."" The US has delivered over 5,000 Javelins to Ukraine from US stockpiles and almost 500 more from allies and partners. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Javelins have been ""very, very effective in this fight"" and Ukrainian officials have at times asked for 500 Javelin anti-tank missiles daily. Sending Ukraine those Javelins quickly has become a numbers game. The Lockheed Martin facility can produce up to 2,100 Javelins per year, which is less than half of what the US has sent to Ukraine so far. Lockheed Martin's CEO, James Taiclet, told CNN on Tuesday that the company plans to ramp up its production of Javelins, but he warned that it could take years to boost production significantly. ""Our goal here is to take the production rate of Javelins from about 2,100 per year to upwards of 4,000 a year. And we have to make sure we can tie all the loose ends together to do that, but we're pretty confident we can,"" Taiclet said. ""I think the ramping up will be linear, but it will take a couple of years to get there,"" he added. Biden said Congress must quickly pass the $33 billion new aid package, telling those in the audience on Tuesday, ""This fight isn't going to be cheap, but caving to aggression would even be more costly."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday the US has been able to transfer equipment from stockpiles ""without affecting military readiness."" Because each Javelin requires more than 200 semiconductors to be produced, Biden also called on Congress to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act to boost domestic chip manufacturing. He said semiconductors are ""critical to defense production capacity."" ""That's why we're making it as hard as we can for Russia to get a hold of these semiconductors and advanced technologies that can be used to upgrade its military during this conflict and why we're making it easier to source what we need here in the United States during the global semiconductor shortage,"" Biden continued. ""It's just one more reason why Congress has to act quickly to provide the emergency funding in the so-called CHIPS Act by passing a broader Bipartisan Innovation Act.""",49,3.1700871713758216,4.148875743565496,-0.9787885721896741,8
2022-05-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/russia-ukraine-declaration-of-war-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"Putin may soon officially declare war on Ukraine, US and Western officials say","Russian President Vladimir Putin could formally declare war on Ukraine as soon as May 9, a move that would enable the full mobilization of Russia's reserve forces as invasion efforts continue to falter, US and Western officials believe. May 9, known as ""Victory Day"" inside of Russia, commemorates the country's defeat of the Nazis in 1945. Western officials have long believed that Putin would leverage the symbolic significance and propaganda value of that day to announce either a military achievement in Ukraine, a major escalation of hostilities -- or both. Officials have begun to hone in on one scenario, which is that Putin formally declares war on Ukraine on May 9. To date, Putin has insisted on referring to the brutal monthslong conflict as a ""special military operation,"" effectively banning words such as invasion and war. ""I think he will try to move from his 'special operation,'"" British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told LBC Radio last week. ""He's been rolling the pitch, laying the ground for being able to say 'look, this is now a war against Nazis, and what I need is more people. I need more Russian cannon fodder.'"" Throughout the conflict Putin has continuously framed his invasion of Ukraine -- a country with a Jewish president -- as a campaign of supposed ""denazification,"" a description dismissed by historians and political observers alike. Wallace added that he ""would not be surprised, and I don't have any information about this, that he is probably going to declare on this May Day that 'we are now at war with the world's Nazis and we need to mass mobilize the Russian people.'"" A formal declaration of war on May 9 could potentially bolster public support for the invasion. It would also, under Russian law, allow Putin to mobilize reserve forces and draft conscripts, which officials say Russia desperately needs amid a growing manpower shortage. Western and Ukrainian officials have estimated that at least 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war since Russia invaded just over two months ago. Russian battlefield effort 'anemic' Following a series of military and logistical setbacks, Moscow has concentrated efforts on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which has been on the frontline of the Russia-Ukraine conflict since 2014. But the US official on Monday described the Russian war effort there as ""anemic."" ""They'll move in and then declare victory, and then withdraw their troops, only to let the Ukrainians take it back,"" the official told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. The official said problems that have plagued the Russian military since their initial surge have not been fixed. ""They're still suffering from poor command-and-control, low morale in many units, less-than-ideal logistics,"" the official said. Russian forces were also keen to avoid risks that could lead to further casualties to their already depleted forces, the official said, describing the ground war in the area as ""very cautious, very tepid."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces were making significant progress in pushing the Russians back around Kharkiv, at the northwestern tip of the Donbas region, the official said. ""An incredible effort there that, again, hasn't gotten a lot of headlines and hasn't gotten a lot of attention, but it's just another piece of the stiff Ukrainian resistance that they continue to demonstrate,"" the official said. Putin's other May 9 options With less than a week to go before the May 9 Victory Day, Moscow may look at places other than Donbas to make a statement. Other options include annexing the breakaway territories of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, making a major push for Odesa in the south, or declaring full control over the southern port city of Mariupol. The US has ""highly credible"" intelligence reports that Russia will try to annex Luhansk and Donetsk ""some time in mid-May,"" the US Ambassador to OSCE Michael Carpenter said on Monday. There are also indications that Russia could be planning to declare and annex a ""people's republic"" in the southeastern city of Kherson. US State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday there is ""good reason to believe that the Russians will do everything they can to use"" May 9 for propaganda purposes. ""We've seen the Russians really double down on their propaganda efforts, probably, almost certainly, as a means to distract from their tactical and strategic failures on the battlefield in Ukraine,"" Price said at a State Department briefing. Price added that it ""would be a great irony if Moscow used the occasion of 'Victory Day' to declare war, which in itself would allow them to surge conscripts in a way they're not able to do now, in a way that would be tantamount to revealing to the world that their war effort is failing, that they are floundering in their military campaign and military objectives."" ""I'm quite confident that we'll be hearing more from Moscow in the lead up to May 9,"" Price added. ""I'm quite confident that you will be hearing more from the United States, from our partners, including our NATO partners, in the lead up to May 9 as well.""",7,5.369645099502966,4.594353585010067,0.7752915144928991,9
2022-05-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/politics/dhs-disinformation-board/index.html,Biden administration defends disinformation board from fierce GOP criticism,"The Department of Homeland Security and the White House are defending a new initiative to help target disinformation amid fierce criticism from Republicans who cast the effort as overreach and attacked its leader. Last week, DHS announced an interagency team, dubbed the ""Disinformation Governance Board,"" to coordinate department activities related to disinformation aimed at the US population and infrastructure. Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert with experience working on Ukraine and Russia issues, was tapped to helm the board, along with two senior DHS officials, including acting Principal Deputy General Counsel Jen Daskal. Jankowicz's appointment quickly drew condemnation from GOP lawmakers and right-wing media, who pointed to her past tweets and statements regarding Hunter Biden's laptop and Christopher Steele, the author of the so-called Steele Dossier. Jankowicz weighed in more recently on Elon's Musk's bid to buy Twitter, writing, ""I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities ... which are already shouldering ... disproportionate amounts of this abuse."" The Republican-led backlash was swift. GOP Reps. John Katko of New York and Mike Turner of Ohio sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, raising ""serious concerns"" with the initiative under Jankowicz. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri similarly wrote a letter to Mayorkas, arguing the board is ""dangerous and un-American"" and calling for it to be dissolved. The board, though, is an internal working group and doesn't have operational authority, instead serving in a more advisory role. It's intended to gather best practices and support counter-disinformation activities, not monitor Americans, Mayorkas said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""It works to ensure that the way in which we address threats, the connectivity between threats and acts of violence that are addressed without infringing on free speech, protecting civil rights and civil liberties, the right of privacy,"" Mayorkas said, conceding that the department could've done a better job of explaining the group's role. ""This working group, internal working group, will draw from best practices and communicate those best practices to the operators because the board does not have operational authority,"" Mayorkas added. In a fact sheet released Monday afternoon, DHS said Mayorkas has asked department officials to enhance the public's trust in the group. Mayorkas has also asked the bipartisan Homeland Security Advisory Council to recommend ways DHS can address disinformation while ""protecting free speech and other fundamental rights,"" according to the fact sheet. Jamie Gorelick -- the council's co-chair and a former US deputy attorney general -- will lead the effort along with Michael Chertoff, a member of the council who was secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush. ""There has been confusion about the working group, its role, and its activities. The reaction to this working group has prompted DHS to assess what steps we should take to build the trust needed for the Department to be effective in this space,"" the fact sheet stated, adding that the group will release quarterly reports about its work to Congress. CNN has reached out to Jankowicz for additional comment. Jankowicz announced her appointment on Twitter last week and responded to some of the criticism regarding a tweet on Hunter Biden's laptop during a 2020 presidential debate. ""For those who believe this tweet is a key to all my views, it is simply a direct quote from both candidates during the final presidential debate. If you look at my timeline, you will see I was livetweeting that evening,"" she wrote. The board will also not be putting out fact checks, as critics have suggested. Jankowicz has focused on disinformation and Eastern Europe for years and advised the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on the subject in 2016 and 2017, according to her website. She is fluent in Russian, and her book ""How to Lose the Information War"" examines how five Western governments have dealt with Russian disinformation. Despite her expertise, critics argue she's biased against claims of Democrats' misdeeds, former President Donald Trump's record, Covid-19 measures and free speech, among other issues. In a TikTok video posted prior to her appointment to lead the board, for example, Jankowicz singled out Rudy Giuliani and TikTok influencers to a Mary Poppins jingle. ""When Rudy Giuliani shared bad intel from Ukraine or when TikTok influencers say Covid can't cause pain, they're laundering disinfo and we really should take note, and not support their lies with our wallet, voice, or vote,"" she said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki came to Jankowicz's defense on Monday. ""The woman you noted has extensive experience and has done extensive work addressing disinformation,"" Psaki said. ""She has testified before Congress; she has testified in Europe. She has worked closely with the Ukrainians and has unique expertise, especially at this moment we're facing."" In network interviews Sunday, Mayorkas also stood by Jankowicz. Asked about Republican criticism of Jankowicz and her ability to be objective by CNN's Dana Bash, Mayorkas replied: ""Eminently qualified, a renowned expert in the field of disinformation."" The concept of the board dates to last year. At the time, Homeland Security officials began discussing a group to provide guidance on policies and privacy protection questions, given that agencies within the department were already collecting information for purposes related to their missions, according to John Cohen, the former acting head of the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis. One of the questions the working group could help with, officials thought, was whether agencies could share information with one another that they had obtained through their own authorities, Cohen said. ""Every threat area of concern to the department is impacted by the fact that foreign intelligence services, terrorist groups, criminal organizations are spreading disinformation via internet-based communication platforms,"" Cohen said. The ""Disinformation Governance Board"" focuses first on disinformation surrounding human migration into the US and potential disinformation threats from Russia aimed at US critical infrastructure, DHS said in a news release last week. Russian disinformation campaigns against Americans have gone on for years, including during election cycles. US officials are always watching for new signs of Kremlin-backed efforts to sow divisions, particularly in light of Russia's war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, US challenges in dealing with migrants trying to enter the US are exacerbated by smugglers who ""make a profit by spreading false information that endangers lives,"" DHS said in last week's news release. Last week, during congressional hearings, Mayorkas warned of a rise in misinformation and disinformation trying to target the integrity of the election system. ""We are seeing a rise in misinformation and disinformation that is attempting to strike at the integrity of the election system and people's right to vote,"" Mayorkas said when asked by Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat, about radicalization before the upcoming 2022 elections. Mayorkas said he had addressed secretaries of state throughout the country a few weeks ago to discuss efforts to ensure the safety of officials and the electoral system.",20,5.263800769213452,5.968157107230342,-0.7043563380168898,28
2022-04-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/europe/mariupol-azovstal-steel-plant-intl-cmd/index.html,'They never expected Mariupol to resist.' Locals horrified by Russia's relentless attack on the vast steel plant shielding Ukrainians,"Lviv, Ukraine — Few beyond the metals industry had heard of Mariupol's Azovstal Steel and Iron Works before it became the scene of a desperate last stand against Russia's invading forces. Until recently Azovstal was a major player on the global stage, producing 4 million tons of steel annually and exporting the majority across the globe, according to its owner Metinvest Holding, Ukraine's biggest steelmaker. From London's Shard skyscraper to Hudson Yards in Manhattan to Genoa's San Giorgio Bridge (which replaced the collapsed Morandi Bridge), steel produced at Azovstal is used in some of the world's most recognizable landmarks. But for weeks now, the world has been gripped by the battle raging over the steelworks on the coast of the Sea of Azov. The pocket of Ukrainian fighters entrenched at the plant has become a symbol of the country's unwavering resistance in the face of an enemy that far outnumbers them. Yuriy Ryzhenkov, CEO of Metinvest Holding which owns the plant, is devastated by what he sees happening to the plant and to Mariupol. ""The city's literally under siege for almost two months now. And the Russians, they don't allow us to bring food into the city or water into the city,"" Ryzhenkov says. ""They're not allowing us to take the civilians out of the city in a centralized manner. They make the people either move out in their own automobiles or even walk by foot through the minefields. It's a humanitarian disaster there."" Asked why Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to take Azovstal so badly, Ryzhenkov tells CNN, ""I don't think it's the plant that he wants."" ""I think it's about the symbolism that they wanted to conquer Mariupol. They never expected Mariupol to resist."" At least 150 employees have been killed and thousands remain unaccounted for, he says. ""What we know is that out of the 11,000 employees at Azovstal,"" says Ryzhenkov, ""only about 4,500 people got out of Mariupol and got in contact with us so we know their whereabouts."" He seems haunted by the fate of Azovstal's workforce. ""For the last two months, the whole company tried to do anything possible to get the people to the safety. Unfortunately, at the moment, we're still not even half-way there."" The company's staff includes family dynasties who have made steel for as long as they can remember. Ivan Goltvenko, a 38-year-old human resources director at the plant, is the third generation of his family to work at Azovstal. ""I hoped I would work for Azovstal all my life and will contribute a lot to the fabric and to my city,"" he says sadly. ""Seeing your city being destroyed is horrible, You could compare it to a relative dying in your arms ... And seeing him or her dying gradually, organ after organ failing, and you can do nothing."" From the city of Zaphorizhzhia, he finds it hard to watch the scale of the devastation wrought by Russian airstrikes ""because you want your city to remain the same as it was in your memory."" News of what's happening back home is filtering through from friends and colleagues who are still trapped in Mariupol. ""Today, for example, I was shown a video of my apartment. Despite the fact that the house survived, my flat is completely looted by Russian soldiers. Nothing valuable was left -- they even rummaged among the children's toys, and many of them were stolen."" He says he spoke to one colleague on April 24 who revealed some of the horrors with which residents are being confronted. ""From one of the employees, who has a connection, we know that he is in the city, he didn't manage to leave, and he has been involved in debris removal and transporting the bodies of dead citizens,"" Goltvenko says. ""And yesterday he told me that for one day from only one district of the city, I would even say 'from only one street' he loaded four trucks of bodies. ""He said: 'I was drawn to volunteering at the morgue to collect bodies in the city and take them away.'"" ""For that,"" says Goltvenko, ""he receives a dry ration."" His colleague, 49-year-old Oleksiy Ehorov, deputy head for repairs, has lived in Mariupol since he was a child. ""I studied there, I started working there, there I've become the person who I am now. And seeing how it has been destroyed ... You can't tell it without tears, without a lump in the throat,"" he says. The agony is not over. Russian jets and missiles continue to pummel the site despite Putin saying last week there was no need to storm the industrial area around the plant. The defenders of Azovstal have repeatedly refused to give up their weapons. There are thought to be hundreds of soldiers and civilians still in the plant. Before the war What has happened at Azovstal is a mirror image of what's happened to a city proud of its history and industrial heritage. The industrial port city was perhaps never conventionally beautiful, with chimney stacks emitting smoke and steam into the sky over the plant. At the port, blue and yellow cranes moved heavy items around the bustling shipyard. But Mariupol had its charm and was beloved by its residents. In recent years, major improvements had been made, green spaces were developed and quality of life for the working-class communities was at last improving. ""The last eight years we've spent on building a modern and comfortable city there ... a good city to live in,"" Ryzhenkov says. ""We've completed some major environmental projects, and there were still plans to make sure that we have clean air, that we have clean water and so on and so forth. And now we're seeing all that is being destroyed in less than two months."" Maryna Holovnova, 28, says ""it was like a living dream"" because ""we had worked towards turning the city from just industrial small town to a cultural capital."" The Mariupol native returned in 2020 after a 10-year absence to find a burgeoning social scene. ""It was completely different,"" she tells CNN, proudly adding it had even been designated Ukraine's Cultural Capital last year by the Ministry of Culture. ""We had so many festivals and we had so many people coming from other cities and from other countries as well,"" she continues. ""We got a chance to tell the people about the city not only from the perspective of industrial development, but also from a cultural point of view [and] from the historical point of view -- because Mariupol has an amazing history."" A beaming smile spreads across her face as the former city guide remembers the route she'd take visitors on. It would start at Mariupol's century-old Old Water Tower, she says, before winding around the city center, taking in its many historic buildings and locations tied to home-grown personalities. Holovnova says with the waterfront metropolis continuing to thrive, a sailing tour was introduced last year, and plans were underway to launch an industrial-themed excursion complete with a factory tour showcasing the process of steel production. ""One of my favorite places, which was weird as locals wouldn't understand me ... was an observation point from where you could see the whole Azovstal factory and you could see how big it was, how huge it was, how great it was,"" she says. ""For locals it was nothing special because we get used to it but all the foreigners, people from other cities, they were amazed by the view."" City under siege The blossoming of Mariupol was an unlikely story, because it was swallowed by the violence of the 20th century. It was the scene of bitter fighting in World War II. This time, the devastation is even greater. Ukrainian officials say less than 20% of the city's buildings are unscathed. Russia's merciless bombing campaign has left rubble where landmarks like the Drama Theater once stood. Ukrainian officials say about 300 of the estimated 1,300 civilians who had sought sanctuary in the cultural institution are believed to have died when it was bombed in a brazen attack by Russia on March 16. The same applies to Azovstal. Built in 1933 under Soviet rule, it was partially demolished during the Nazi occupation in the 1940s before being rebuilt. Now it is gone again -- its carcass sheltering Ukrainian soldiers and around 1,000 civilians in a maze of underground chambers, according to Ukrainian officials. An estimated 100,000 people remain in the city. On Thursday, local authorities warned Mariupol was vulnerable to epidemics given the appalling sanitary conditions in much of the city and the fact that maybe thousands of bodies remain uncollected. Oleksiy Ehorov can't bear to think of what has happened to his city -- and his family. His mother-in-law died from injuries sustained from shelling during their first attempt to flee to Zaporizhzhia. ""My emotions disappeared already there in Mariupol. That's why there's nothing but hate,"" he tells CNN. Ehorov says he loved living by the sea and had hoped to stay at the steelworks until he retired. Now all he can do is watch as Russia continues to blockade the city and his former workplace. When asked if he'd work under the Russians if they take the factory, he echoes Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man and the main shareholder of the group behind Azovstal steel. ""No. I'm not going to. After what they did ... never.""",47,4.04155929000767,3.4275724403233916,0.6139868496842782,24
2022-04-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/politics/russia-military-progress-eastern-ukraine/index.html,"Russia making 'slow and uneven' progress as military tries to fix problems that plagued early invasion, US officials say","Russian forces have made some progress in Moscow's renewed assault on eastern Ukraine, according to US and NATO officials, as their military tries to fix the myriad problems that plagued the early weeks of the invasion. The US has seen ""some evidence"" of improvement in Russia's ability to combine air and ground operations, as well as its capacity for resupplying forces in the field, officials say. The progress is ""slow and uneven,"" a senior US defense official said, allowing Russian forces to advance only ""several kilometers or so"" each day. But the US assesses that Russia is trying to learn from the mistakes it made early on, where columns of tanks and armor ran out of food and fuel, leaving them easy prey to Ukrainian hit-and-run tactics. Russia has placed command and control elements near its border with eastern Ukraine, according to a senior NATO official, a sign they are attempting to fix the communications and coordination failures observed in the attack on Kyiv. Before the invasion began on February 24, Russia amassed 125 to 130 battalion tactical groups, known as BTGs, around Ukraine and near Kyiv in particular, but when the fighting began, Russia's military leaders showed little ability to have them fight as one. There are 92 BTGS in country now, with another 20 just across border in Russia, according to the senior defense official. ""The attacks are somewhat better coordinated but with small formations. Company size units with helicopter support,"" a European defense official said. ""The lowest level of mutual support. In NATO this would be basic stuff."" Still, western officials familiar with the latest intelligence say even if Russia has learned key lessons from its systemic failures in the first stage of the conflict, it's not clear that Moscow will be able to implement the necessary changes to dominate in the Donbas region. Its military has suffered heavy losses in both manpower and equipment and officials believe that other equipment relocated from different parts of Ukraine likely isn't fully repaired yet. Many of the fighting units have cobbled together soldiers who have never fought or trained together. ""I don't know how many lessons they can actually operationalize. It's not a simple thing,"" said the senior NATO official. ""You don't just move tanks and personnel and say, 'Now go back into the fight!'"" US and Western officials largely agree with the assessment that a few weeks is not enough time for Russia to reconstitute its forces from the first phase of the campaign -- which took place across broad swaths of Ukrainian territory and led to the loss of thousands of Russian soldiers -- and believe Moscow will keep throwing additional forces into the conflict piecemeal. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been under pressure to demonstrate he can show a victory, and eastern Ukraine is the place where he is most likely to be able to quickly do that, US officials say. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin is focused on May 9, Russia's ""Victory Day,"" but even if he makes some sort of declaration then, officials say it will be unlikely to mark the end of his war on Ukraine. ""I think that date's likely to be a date where something is declared, but then they move on with the rest of the campaign,"" the senior NATO official said. A more conventional fight US and western officials caution that Russia's renewed assault, focused on breaking through Ukrainian defenses in the east using troops and materiel withdrawn from across the north of the country, is not yet fully underway. Russia continues to barrage Mariupol in the south, but in Donbas, its advances have been far more incremental. Officials anticipate the second phase of the campaign, focused on eastern Ukraine, will in some ways unfold quite differently from the initial assault that largely focused on capturing major urban areas. The dry and grassy plain isn't homogenous across the region, but in places may favor more conventional tank warfare. And unlike in the rest of the country, Ukraine has been fighting Russian-backed separatists there from dug-in trench positions since 2014. ""This renewed effort in Donbas, we'll see Russia mounting a campaign that I think is going to look a lot like conventional fights, really going back to World War I and World War II: much heavier equipment, different terrain, much more open,"" said the senior NATO official. Russia is ""sticking much more to a classic Russian military doctrine this time,"" said another NATO official -- in part because the proximity to the Russian border allows Russia to maintain shorter, more efficient supply lines. Russian forces have offered more coordinated air support to troops on the ground in Donbas and have been ""putting troops in less danger to keep casualties lower."" Western officials expect Russia to launch a three-pronged offensive to try to isolate and defeat the Ukrainian forces in a pincer. ""The concerns of the fight in the east are multifold,"" Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democratic from Illinois, told CNN. ""First of all, this is better terrain for the Russians. Second, shorter supply lines, lessons learned, and the fact that you've got a very angry Putin who is trying to rehabilitate, I think, the Russian military to the rest of the world."" One of Russia's key advantages remains the sheer size of the military force and the equipment the Kremlin has committed to this war. Last week, the US assessed about 75% of the forces it prepped for this invasion to be still intact, and the Kremlin has shown a willingness to commit as many forces as needed for their stated objective of controlling the Donbas region. It has a military ""mass"" that it is willing to throw at the objective until it is complete, one source told CNN, noting Putin has shown a complete indifference to how many Russian forces are killed in the process. No guaranteed outcome Still, despite the military advantages Russia still has, it's unclear whether it's enough to guarantee them the battlefield success that they failed to achieve around Kyiv and elsewhere. Russian units are in worse shape than expected, according to a US assessment, a defense official told CNN. ""Some tanks have a driver and no crew,"" the official said. ""Some (armored personnel carriers) have no one out the back."" Some of the units are down to 70% strength, the official noted, which is the line where western combat doctrine states that a unit can no longer be combat effective. The Russians have used poorly maintained and outdated equipment to refit their BTGs, mixing modernized and unmodernized equipment that could degrade their ability to effectively maneuver on the battlefield. At each step, Russia's attack on the Donbas region faces the same stiff Ukrainian resistance that stopped their advance toward Kyiv, with one notable difference. Ukrainian forces have fought Russian-backed separatists for years in this region, offering them ample time to dig into fortified defense positions. The Ukrainians are integrating new weapons and vehicles received from other countries, including the US, and continuing to exact a heavy toll, one source familiar with the situation told CNN. And as Russia has to extend its supply lines into Donbas, they will become more vulnerable, the source said. US officials also continue to take note of the composition of the Russian army, including Putin's move to extend enlistments and pull up the next wave of conscripts -- many of whom have been inactive for a long time. This suggests Putin is ""scraping bottom of the barrel,"" the source familiar with the situation said. ""Putin faces a conundrum. His force is declining in capability and his personnel status is one of his biggest problems. Reaching into the reserves aren't going to help ... in fact, I'd suggest that's going to hurt. It may provide 'bodies' but not trained soldiers who will make a difference,"" CNN military analyst and retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said. And the morale issues that have bedeviled Russian forces are still present. ""We have some early indications that while the conscripts start out with high morale because they've been feasting on Russian propaganda, it doesn't take very long before that morale is sapped once they get put into combat and face Ukrainian resistance,"" said the senior defense official Thursday on a background call with reporters. Finally, the weather may hamper Russian tanks. Mud may force them to stick to the roads, leaving them vulnerable to Ukrainian forces, as was the case on the outskirts of Kyiv. And taking urban areas in any war is challenging -- and favors the defender. ""I don't think the war is going to be over in the near term,"" said the senior NATO official.",7,4.942769065063191,4.5967915344399835,0.34597753062320713,9
2022-04-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/europe/russia-tanks-blown-turrets-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,Russia's tanks in Ukraine have a 'jack-in-the-box' design flaw. And the West has known about it since the Gulf war,"Russian tanks with their tops blown off are just the latest sign that Russia's invasion of Ukraine isn't going to plan. Hundreds of Russian tanks are thought to have been destroyed since Moscow launched its offensive, with British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace on Monday estimating it had lost as many as 580. But Moscow's problems go beyond the sheer number of tanks it has lost. Experts say battlefield images show Russian tanks are suffering from a defect that Western militaries have known about for decades and refer to as the ""jack-in-the-box effect."" Moscow, they say, should have seen the problem coming. The problem relates to how the tanks' ammunition is stored. Unlike modern Western tanks, Russian ones carry multiple shells within their turrets. This makes them highly vulnerable as even an indirect hit can start a chain reaction that explodes their entire ammunition store of up to 40 shells. The resulting shockwave can be enough to blast the tank's turret as high as a two-story building, as can be seen in a recent video on social media. ""What we are witnessing with Russian tanks is a design flaw,"" said Sam Bendett, adviser with the Russia Studies Program at CNA and an adjunct senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security. ""Any successful hit ... quickly ignites the ammo causing a massive explosion, and the turret is literally blown off."" The flaw means the tank's crew -- usually two men in the turret and a third driving -- are sitting ducks, said Nicholas Drummond, a defense industry analyst specializing in land warfare and a former British Army officer. ""If you don't get out within the first second, you're toast."" The 'jack-in-the-box"" effect Drummond said exploding munitions are causing problems for almost all of the armored vehicles Russia is using in Ukraine. He gave the example of the BMD-4 infantry fighting vehicle, typically manned by up to three crew and able to carry another five soldiers. He said the BMD-4 was a ""mobile coffin"" that was ""just obliterated"" when hit by a rocket. But the design flaw with its tanks should be particularly galling for Moscow as the problems have been so widely telegraphed. They came to the attention of Western militaries during the Gulf wars against Iraq in 1991 and 2003, when large numbers of the Iraqi army's Russian-made T-72 tanks suffered the same fate -- turrets being blown from their bodies in anti-tank missile strikes. Drummond said Russia hadn't learned the lessons from Iraq and that consequently many of its tanks in Ukraine featured similar design flaws with their autoloading missile systems. When the T-90 series -- the successor to the T-72 -- came into service in 1992 its armor was upgraded but its ammunition loading system remained similar to its predecessor's, leaving it just as vulnerable, Drummond said. The T-80, another Russian tank seeing action in the Ukraine invasion, has a similar ammunition loading system. There are some benefits to such a system. Bendett, at the Center for a New American Security, said Russia had chosen this system to save space and give the tanks a lower profile, making them harder to hit in battle. Western militaries, however, had been spurred into action by the T-72's fate in Iraq. ""(Western militaries) all learned from the Gulf War, and from seeing tanks killed during that time, that you have to compartmentalize the ammunition,"" Drummond said. He pointed to the US military's Stryker infantry fighting vehicles developed after the first war in Iraq. ""That has a turret that sits on top, and that turret does not enter the crew compartment. It purely sits on top and all the ammunition is inside that turret,"" he said. ""So if the turret gets hit and blown off, the crew is still safe below. That's a very clever design."" Other Western tanks, such as the M1 Abrams used by the US and some allied armies, are larger and have no carousel. In the Abrams, a fourth crew member in the tank retrieves shells from a sealed compartment and transfers them to the gun for firing. The compartment has a door that the crew member opens and closes between each shot taken by the tank, meaning that if the tank is hit, only one shell is likely to be exposed in the turret. ""An accurate hit can damage the tank, but not necessarily kill the crew,"" Bendett said. And Drummond said the shells used by Western militaries sometimes burn under the high heat generated by an incoming missile, but they don't explode. Hard to replace There is no easy way of knowing how many Russian tanks have been destroyed in Ukraine. The open-source intelligence monitoring website Oryx said on April 28 that at least 300 Russian tanks had been destroyed, with another 279 either damaged, abandoned or captured. However, the site only counts instances where it has visual evidence, so Russian losses could be much higher. And these losses are not just about equipment. When Wallace, the British defense secretary, gave his estimate of 580 lost tanks to the House of Commons he also said more than 15,000 Russian military personnel had been killed during its invasion. It's hard to know how many of those are tank crew, but what is not in doubt is that the crews are not easy to replace. Training a tank crew could take several months at a minimum and even 12 months could be considered quick, said Aleksi Roinila, a former tank crewman in the Finnish Defense Forces. And for Russia to replace hundreds of crew at this point in the war would be a tall order -- especially when the tanks they are expected to use are so flawed.",49,2.669869109869751,4.538093853279731,-1.8682247434099803,23
2022-04-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/europe/mariupol-ukraine-russia-intl-hnk/index.html,"Mass graves near besieged Ukrainian city Mariupol are evidence of war crimes, say Ukrainian officials","Ukrainian officials say they have identified mass graves outside the city of Mariupol, which they say adds to mounting proof of Russian war crimes against Ukrainian civilians. The claim is supported by photos collected and analyzed by US satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies that appears to show more than 200 new graves at a site on the northwestern edge of Manhush, a town around 12 miles (19 kilometers) to the west of Mariupol. An estimated 100,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol which has been under constant bombardment since it was surrounded by Russian forces on March 1, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukrainian officials claim that more than 20,000 people in the city have died during the assault. In a post Thursday on messaging app Telegram, Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, said Russian trucks had collected bodies from the port city, before ""dumping them"" in Manhush. ""This is direct evidence of war crimes and attempts to cover them up."" A Maxar review of the satellite images from mid-March through to mid-April indicated the expansion of the grave site began between March 23 to 26, and continued into April. According to Maxar's analysis, there are more than 200 newly dug graves at a site on the northwestern edge of Manhush. ""According to recent media reports, Russian soldiers have been taking the bodies of people killed in Mariupol to this location,"" Maxar said in its analysis. CNN cannot independently verify claims Russians have disposed of bodies in mass graves at that location. A firm death toll following weeks of heavy bombardment of Mariupol is not available. However, journalists in Mariupol have documented the hasty burial of civilians in the besieged city, and images have surfaced on social media showing bodies apparently left for collection in the city. Vadym Boichenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said Thursday that women, children and elderly had died on the streets of the city. ""Unfortunately, we have seen that the bodies of dead Mariupol residents have begun to disappear from the streets of our city,"" he said. According to Boichenko, the mass graves are off a bypass road, near a cemetery. He said there was a field near the cemetery with 30 meter-long (98-feet-long) ditches. ""And there they bury them, bring the bodies of the dead by trucks and throw them into these ditches,"" he said. Putin proclaims Mariupol liberated Evidence of mass graves outside Mariupol surfaced as Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed the ""liberation"" of the southeastern port city by Russian forces -- even as he called off an attempt to storm the Azovstal steel plant, the final bastion of Ukrainian defenders inside the city, where civilians have also sheltered. Mariupol has been under near constant attack since the early day's of Putin's invasion, and much of the city has been destroyed by Russian shelling. Civilian structures targeted included a maternity hospital and a theater where up to 1,300 people were seeking refuge. Though many have fled, an estimated 100,000 people still remain in Mariupol and its immediate surroundings, which are reported to be largely under Russian control. Ukrainian officials, who maintain the city remains contested, have warned of a major humanitarian emergency in Mariupol as food and water run out, with electricity and gas cut -- but several attempts to establish evacuation corridors to allow civilians to escape have failed. ""Unfortunately, it is not possible today to evacuate civilians from Azovstal,"" Boichenko, the city's mayor, said Thursday. ""Because we are asking for a stable ceasefire. Somewhere we need one day to be able to accommodate those residents who have been hiding there for 57 days in a row, and they are being bombed, bombed and bombed."" US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said Wednesday that there ""was some hope that the Russians might allow"" safe passage for civilians and wounded soldiers from Mariupol. However, she warned that such an arrangement ""has fallen apart a number of times before"" and ultimately it is up to the Russians to allow safe passage. She also added that the siege of Mariupol speaks ""to the brutality of this war"" and the war crimes Vladimir Putin is committing. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general, said earlier this month that her office is investigating 5,800 cases of alleged Russian war crimes, with ""more and more"" proceedings opening every day. US President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has called the atrocities being uncovered in Ukraine a ""genocide."" Russia has denied allegations of war crimes and claims its forces do not target civilians.",47,5.335234599187176,3.3493029302445096,1.9859316689426665,24
2022-04-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/europe/ukraine-sexual-violence-allegations-russia-cmd-intl/index.html,"Russian troops use rape as 'an instrument of war' in Ukraine, rights groups allege","When Russian troops invaded Ukraine and began closing in on its capital, Kyiv, Andrii Dereko begged his 22-year-old stepdaughter Karina Yershova to leave the suburb where she lived. But Yershova insisted she wanted to remain in Bucha, telling him: ""Don't talk nonsense, everything will be fine -- there will be no war,"" he said. With her tattoos and long brown hair, Yershova stood out in a crowd, her stepfather said, adding that despite living with rheumatoid arthritis, she had a fiercely independent spirit: ""She herself decided how to live."" Yershova worked at a sushi restaurant in Bucha, and hoped to earn her university degree in the future, Dereko said: ""She wanted to develop herself."" As Russian soldiers surrounded Bucha in early March, Yershova hid in an apartment with two other friends. On one of the last occasions Dereko and his wife, Olena, heard from Yershova, she told them she had left the apartment to get food from a nearby supermarket. ""We did not think that Russians would reach such a point that they would shoot civilians,"" he said. ""We all hoped that at least they would not touch women and children -- but the opposite happened."" When weeks went by without a word from Yershova, the family became desperate for news. Her mother left a message on Facebook begging anyone who knew what had happened to her to get in touch. She was told by friends that images of a dead woman with similar tattoos to Yershova's -- which included a rose on her forearm -- had been posted on a Telegram group set up by a detective in Bucha who was trying to identify hundreds of bodies found in the town after Russian troops withdrew from the area two weeks ago. Dereko says the images, seen by CNN, show his stepdaughter's mutilated body. Police told the family she had been killed by Russian soldiers. It looked like she was tortured or put up a fight, he said. ""They mutilated her. They shot her in the leg, and then gave her a tourniquet to stop her bleeding. And then they shot her in the temple."" Dereko also believes Yershova was sexually abused by Russian troops. ""The [police] investigator hinted"" that she had been raped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this claim. Officers who oversaw the case declined to comment to CNN due to the ongoing investigation. CNN has reached out to Kyiv prosecutors for comment. The Dereko family's agonizing wait for answers reflects the rising anxiety amid reports of wartime rape in the country. Ukrainian officials say Russian forces have been sexually abusing women, children and men since the invasion began, using rape and other sexual offenses as weapons of war. Human rights groups and Ukrainian psychologists who CNN spoke to say they have been working around the clock to deal with a growing number of sexual abuse cases allegedly involving Russian soldiers. A report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), released on April 13, found violations of international humanitarian law by Russian forces in Ukraine, noting that ""reports indicate instances of conflict-related gender-based violence, such as rape, sexual violence or sexual harassment."" ""Russian soldiers are doing everything they can to show their dominance, and rape is also a tool here,"" said psychologist Vasylisa Levchenko, who founded a service that provides free counselling for Ukrainians suffering from war-related trauma. Levchenko says her network, called Psy.For.Peace, has spoken to roughly 50 women from the Kyiv region who say they were sexually assaulted by Russian soldiers. She told CNN the group is dealing with cases including a 15-year-old and her mother who were sexually abused by pro-Russian Chechen soldiers, and the gang rape of another woman by seven soldiers -- while Ukrainian detainees were forced to watch. CNN has been unable to independently verify the account. ""The weapon [rape] is a demonstration of complete contempt for the [Ukrainian] people,"" Levchenko said, adding that it is one which has an impact far beyond the victims of individual attacks: ""There are people who feel guilty for not being able to do anything, guilty for surviving, for watching a person dying in front of them."" Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians since the war began -- a claim disproven by numerous attacks that have been verified by CNN and other news organizations. CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment. Breaking morale Alyona Krivulyak, who heads up a national hotline at La Strada-Ukraine -- a group that campaigns against gender-based violence -- told CNN that the hotline has received nine accounts of rape from around the country, the majority of them gang rapes of women. ""Rape is an instrument of war against the civilian population -- an instrument of destruction of the Ukrainian nation,"" she said. Psychologist Alexandra Kvitko, who works on a hotline for trauma victims run by Ukraine's ombudsman with the support of UNICEF, said she has heard dozens of accounts of conflict-related sexual violence. ""This amount of sexual violence, this kind of brutality has never happened before,"" she told CNN. In the five years she has been practicing, Kvitko said she had only dealt with 10 cases of sexual assault before the invasion. ""Now, in a few weeks of work I have 50 cases, and these are not only women -- these are children and boys and men,"" she said. Rape is being used to break the morale of Ukrainians, she said, ""to stop people from resisting."" Kvitko said that when one client ran out into the street to stop soldiers from raping her 19-year-old sister, ""a military man came up, grabbed her and said: 'No! Look! Tell everyone that this will happen to every Nazi whore.'"" Any such act of conflict-related sexual violence -- rape, forced prostitution, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy -- is considered a war crime and a breach of international human rights laws, said Charu Lata Hogg, the founder of human rights organization the All Survivors Project, which researches conflict-related sexual violence against men. ""Whether that is triggered within the context of a patriarchal and militarized masculinity, or whether it is exerted as a specific aim of warfare or whether it happens because people find a population at their mercy and therefore decide to inflict further harm,"" it is still a war crime, Lata Hogg told CNN. But even as Ukrainian and international prosecutors from the International Criminal Court (ICC) collect evidence of Russian war crimes, many sexual abuse victims are not yet ready to speak to officials about their ordeal, Levchenko said. ""All our psychologists must provide women with the contacts of the prosecutor's office so that when they are ready, women can seek legal assistance,"" psychologist Levchenko said, adding that none of her clients has so far reached out to Ukrainian prosecutors. Levchenko said many of the victims -- women, men and children -- need time to heal before speaking to the authorities. On Friday Andrii Niebytov, the head of Kyiv's police force, said his officers had only confirmed one suspected rape case so far in the region. ""We have [heard] such reports from outsiders, but when we talk to women, they refuse to confirm or deny such information,"" he said. Horrific precedent Reports of sexual violence often rise during times of conflict, and Ukraine has been no exception. Volodymyr Shcherbachenko, director of the Eastern Ukrainian Centre for Civic Initiatives (EUCCI), told CNN that the country had seen cases of sexual violence being used as a weapon in 2014, when Russian-backed separatists seized territory in the country's east after widespread protests called for closer integration to Europe. A joint report in 2017 by Justice for Peace in Donbas and other rights groups like EUCCI documented cases on both sides of the conflict, including rape and attempted rape, sexual harassment, and coercion to watch sexual violence against others. ""The most widespread form of sexual violence against women was rape,"" the report added. Lata Hogg, from the All Survivors Project, said that in the past month her group has had multiple accounts of sexual violence, ""and the pattern of sexual violence emerging in this context is not dissimilar to those which have been documented in other contexts globally,"" including during the conflict in Chechnya. Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, was leveled by Russian forces in a brutal war in the 1990s and early 2000s. Human Rights Watch reported at the time that Russian soldiers had raped Chechen women in Russian-held areas. Psychologist Levchenko worries that the true scale of Russian atrocities will only emerge when areas like Mariupol are liberated. In occupied cities and towns, Russian forces ""regularly visit women's homes, can check their phones, their photos, social networks,"" making it impossible for women to receive rape kits or other services, Krivulyak from La Strada-Ukraine said. ""This fear of armed people sometimes makes it impossible to ask for help, and this in turn makes it very difficult to document facts, which leads to problems around bringing [perpetrators] to justice,"" she said. Beyond the emotional trauma, ""there is also a very high risk of unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases,"" which is why medical attention is so important, she said. Shcherbachenko said EUCCI case workers are helping one local government worker in an occupied area of southern Ukraine who ""was specifically raped in order to force her to cooperate."" He said Russian soldiers had told her: ""We will rape you again if you don't do what you need to do ... For me, this shows [Russian forces are using] sexual violence as [a] weapon."" 'This time I couldn't save her' Rights groups say victims will shoulder the trauma of sexual abuse for the rest of their lives, while the families of those who died, like Karina Yershova, are left hunting for answers and dealing with the horror of happened to their loved ones. Yershova's body was found in a shallow grave in Bucha, alongside those of 65-year-old Natalia Mazokha and her husband, Victor, 64. CNN pieced together the final moments of their lives. Neighbors told the Mazokhas' daughter Julia that Russian soldiers had dragged a wounded woman -- believed to be Yershova -- into her parent's yard in the middle of March; Natalia tried to help her. The soldiers returned two minutes later, when ""mom was next to her [and] giving her help, and they [the Russians] shot her, shot my mother,"" Julia Mazokha said. Her father was killed in the hallway of their home when he tried to find out what was happening. ""They lay in the yard for 10 days, as I understand it,"" she said. The couple's neighbors called her around March 20 to inform her that her parents had been killed. Mazhokha said she had begged her parents to leave Bucha with her on March 12.

2022-04-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/politics/citizens-funnel-supplies-ukrainian-soldiers/index.html,"A 'lawyer by day and a boot smuggler by night,' this Ukrainian American is helping funnel supplies to Ukrainian soldiers","Tetiana Poudel's father, a deputy commander in Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, needed combat boots. Russia had just invaded Ukraine, and his unit was desperately lacking basic protective gear and medical supplies. So Poudel, a 31-year-old Ukrainian American citizen -- who's on leave from her California day job as an attorney for the music-streaming service Spotify -- packed up her life in Silicon Valley, moved to Poland and raised $13,000 for around 100 pairs of boots for her dad and members of his unit. ""I like to tell people I'm a lawyer by day and a boot smuggler by night,"" she said earlier this month in an interview with CNN. A photo she shared with CNN shows her father and another soldier beaming next to new boots stacked on top of cardboard boxes. Poudel's initiative is a microcosm of a much larger network of private citizens, many of them veterans, from around the world who are working to provide Ukrainian soldiers with additional equipment they say they need to continue effectively fighting off the Russians. In some cases, Poudel and Western officials told CNN, efforts by private citizens to funnel gear and supplies to Ukrainian soldiers have been faster and more direct -- albeit on a much smaller scale -- than the government-led initiatives. The boots are just one need among many -- including firearms, ammunition and body armor -- that volunteers and private citizens from around the world are trying to fulfill for the Ukrainian army, which has ballooned in size since Russia invaded two months ago. The Biden administration is preparing to announce that it is sending another $800 million worth of military assistance to Ukraine, CNN reported Tuesday. If approved, the latest package would mean the US has committed about $3.4 billion in assistance to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began on February 24. But for Poudel and others on the ground, the aid being provided by Western countries is still ""too slow and it's not enough,"" she said. Poudel said she has been able to crowdsource enough money -- through her contacts on LinkedIn, WhatsApp and volunteer organizations like UkraineNow -- to buy the boots and obtain about a dozen tactical vests for her father and members of his unit. She delivered T-shirts to them last week, and the soldiers repaid her with pizza. ""These guys are just so grateful,"" she said. Poudel's godmother had to pick up the boots in Poland and drive them over the border in multiple trips, since Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 aren't allowed to leave the country. At the time, Poudel stayed in Poland with her mother and sister, who had fled Ukraine in the early days of the war. But underscoring how decisive Russia's defeat has been in northern Ukraine, Poudel and her family felt secure enough in recent weeks to move back to their hometown of Lutsk in northwestern Ukraine, as Russia shifted its focus to the east of the country. In a statement to CNN, Serhiy Sobko, a deputy commander and chief of staff for Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, said the troops are thankful for all of the help from volunteers. ""Within a few weeks, the TDF expanded to over 100,000 people ready to protect their country from the enemy,"" Sobko said, which led to a shortage in equipment. ""The Ukrainian government, our international partners, (and) prominent Ukrainian charitable foundations immediately involved their efforts to provide TDF with all needed equipment,"" Sobko said. ""And TDF command makes sure that those brigades and battalions that are on the front line get the protection first. Therefore we are grateful to those volunteers from Ukraine and abroad who contribute to equipping our soldiers."" More is needed, soldiers say A US official told CNN that in terms of equipment and gear, the US has so far provided Ukraine with tactical secure communications systems, night vision devices, thermal imagery systems, optics, laser range finders, explosive ordnance disposal protective gear, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protective equipment, and medical supplies, including first aid kits. The official did not detail how much of that gear has been delivered so far. But the Ukrainian soldiers need much more of all of it, they said, particularly thermal imaging cameras, night vision devices and quadcopters. They also need extremely basic gear, like seat belts, backpacks, flashlights and gloves, according to a list compiled by the soldiers and obtained by CNN. When it comes to shipping in heavier protective gear like body armor, Poudel and other volunteers, including two US Marine veterans she met in Poland, have run into considerable hurdles: Level III and IV body armor is regulated by the US and requires special authorization by the State Department, contracts frequently fall through and any equipment that does get in is often backed up at airports. Level III armor provides protection against rifle rounds and level IV provides the most ballistic protection, according to the National Institute of Justice. ""One of the issues is, obviously, we're just getting through Covid. So you have all kinds of supply conditions that are difficult just on day one,"" Trey Sharpe, one of the Marine veterans helping Poudel, told CNN. ""And then two, anytime you're trying to procure items that are in intense demand, it becomes hard."" Bureaucracy is another challenge, he said. ""So if I want to ship a level IV (body armor) plate out of the United States, for example, I have to deal with American bureaucracy, Polish bureaucracy, Ukrainian bureaucracy, and then I have to get the money too, and I'm trying to do all of this from a cell phone, often in the middle of nowhere,"" he said, referring to his travels throughout western Ukraine. ""It's, you know, it's not like shopping on Amazon. And I don't need just one (plate), I need thousands."" Poudel said the situation is often demoralizing. ""Sometimes I do get very depressed and sad about how much I'm not able to do,"" she said. ""We have pretty much nothing and it's not like it's over just because Russia is refocusing on eastern Ukraine. They are still here"" in the country. It is worth the effort, though, despite the difficulties, she said. ""Doing whatever I can on the ground here feels more meaningful than just sitting in the (United) States, even if it's just like, buying them vests and raincoats,"" she told CNN. ""It's like, OK, I'm doing something real. I really see where it gets delivered."" Poudel added that while humanitarian aid is clearly needed, it is little more than a short-term solution to the widespread suffering Russia is inflicting upon civilians -- if that aid even gets delivered at all. ""I support humanitarian aid,"" Poudel said. ""But I think that is just a Band-Aid. The most important thing right now is to support the Ukrainian armed forces, because in most cases that humanitarian aid isn't even getting into the places that need it."" Poudel's father, Volodymyr Danyliuk, told CNN in a video interview that what is ""most needed are helmets, transport vehicles and air defense systems. Because most of the time they are attacking from the air, and we can't protect ourselves against it."" Ukrainian officials have told the US that to keep Russia from controlling the skies over the country, Ukrainian forces need 500 anti-aircraft Stinger missiles per day. The Pentagon plans to speed up production of the weapons; the shipments have so far not kept up with the Ukrainians' demand. Medicines are similarly hard to come by. Poudel explained that because so many pharmacies have been destroyed, Ukrainian women, including herself, have begun driving into Poland to pick up medications and deliver them back over the border. Private citizens stepping up Poudel said she is grateful to Spotify for allowing her to take leave to be with her family, because she can't imagine leaving her mom and sister to fend for themselves in Ukraine while her father is serving in the Territorial Defense Forces. Spotify declined to comment. ""I'm basically the sole provider for my family right now,"" she said. But when it comes to working to supply the Ukrainian forces, Poudel is far from alone. ""There are thousands and thousands of guys just like me, hundreds of groups just like the group that I started, doing the same thing,"" said another American veteran running a private effort to deliver medical equipment to Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, who requested anonymity to discuss his efforts freely. He said he'd raised enough money for 30 military-grade trauma kits, which he was able to deliver to Ukrainian soldiers earlier this month, according to photos he provided to CNN. A nonprofit organization called the Ukrainian Freedom Fund has also been working to procure defense materials for Ukrainian troops, and it has already provided thousands of bulletproof vests, helmets, vehicles and field first aid kits to Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, CNN previously reported. Kyiv's deputy mayor on Monday requested 200,000 gas masks from the organization to protect troops and civilians against potential chemical weapons attacks. Police departments across the US have joined the effort, too. The governors of Iowa and Nebraska, for example, announced earlier this month that their states would send police protective gear to Ukraine, including military-grade helmets and vests. Poudel, for her part, says she began working with US Marine veterans to try to leverage their connections to companies that can source essential equipment like body armor, helmets and tourniquets. In many cases, the volunteers working to get equipment into Ukraine are making sure US government agencies are aware of their efforts, particularly to ensure that they don't run afoul of any export control laws. Sharpe, one of the Marine veterans, told CNN he had been given preliminary guidance by officials at the Justice and State departments on remaining in compliance as he worked to import supplies. The State and Justice departments declined to comment, but a spokesperson for the Commerce Department told CNN that ""numerous communities around the United States have sought to assist the Ukrainian government and its resistance to Russia's invasion by donating firearms, ammunition, helmets, bulletproof vests and related equipment."" The spokesperson added that the Commerce Department ""has been processing requests rapidly for the export of firearms and ammunition to Ukraine under its existing processes and authorities."" There are a number of things the department has advised Americans to consider if they do try to send equipment, the spokesperson said, including how they intend to transport it to Ukraine and whether or not* the sender has been authorized by the Ukrainian government to import the supplies.

Advances by Russians in the south against besieged defenders in the surrounded city of Mariupol, a key supply hub, are dimming hope for Ukraine's military there after the commander issued a desperate plea for help. Ukraine's government says women and children are also seeking refuge at a steel plant that is the military's redoubt. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday his forces would not storm the plant. More weapons coming. A new injection of weapons is now on its way from the US to help Ukraine adapt to a different stage of the conflict. President Joe Biden said the war is in a critical stage and the US is looking for ways to prop up Ukraine's military. Another $800 million in assistance. On Thursday, Biden announced another roughly $800 million military assistance package to Ukraine -- on top of the $800 million announced last week. ""We have to accelerate that assistance package to help prepare Ukraine for Russia's offensive that's going to be more limited in terms of geography, but not in terms of brutality,"" he said, adding that he would soon be asking Congress for more money to help arm Ukraine. Separately, spare parts have helped Ukraine add about 20 airplanes to its air force, a senior US defense official said Wednesday, although it's not clear where the parts came from. Grand total: It adds up to about $3.4 billion in US assistance to Ukraine since the invasion began. What's being sent to help in the East? Artillery and long-range systems could be more helpful in the more open terrain. This is the same contested Donbas region where Russian-backed forces have been fighting with the Ukrainian military for years. What happens with all this firepower? It's not entirely clear. An interesting CNN report focused on how the US loses track of the weaponry it sends to Ukraine. From CNN's report: In making the decision to send billions of dollars of weapons and equipment into Ukraine, the Biden administration factored in the risk that some of the shipments may ultimately end up in unexpected places, a defense official said. But right now, the official said, the administration views a failure to adequately arm Ukraine as a greater risk. I asked CNN's Oren Liebermann, who helped write recent stories about American military aid, what to make of all these additional weapons likely headed from the US to Ukraine. Pay attention to the importance of artillery, he told me. It is expected to be a big part of the next shipment, and it was an important (though far smaller) part of the last $800 million package. Why wasn't more artillery sent to this point? LIEBERMANN: Because artillery was not the type of weapon needed to defend Kyiv. In the swamps and forests of northern Ukraine, not to mention the Chernobyl exclusion zone, artillery was not a critical part of the fight. With the focus now in Southeast Ukraine, artillery and other long-range weaponry absolutely is critical. Is this new technology or a game-changer in the fight? LIEBERMANN: Let's be clear -- artillery isn't new tech. Maybe the systems are newer and offer a bit more precision or more firepower, but artillery isn't some newfangled piece of military hardware that's never been seen before. Quite the contrary -- it's been an integral part of wars for many, many decades, if not a couple centuries at this point. And yet it's viewed by the US and its partners/allies as one of the most important pieces of weaponry to get to Ukraine ... and fast. Ukraine can burn through artillery ammo quickly, so it's important to get them a very large supply ASAP. How does the Pentagon view its responsibility for these weapons once they're in Ukraine? LIEBERMANN: That's not viewed as critical. It's DoD's job to get it to the border, then Ukraine takes it from there to wherever they believe it's needed. Ukraine has a nearly insatiable appetite right now for more weaponry, and that's what the US is trying to meet, along with the help of other countries. What do we know about what's been sent so far? Per CNN's Ellie Kaufman, a senior US defense official told reporters Wednesday that the first of 40,000 Howitzer rounds, a type of artillery ammunition, have arrived in Europe to be sent to Ukraine. These are a part of last week's $800 million package. The US is training about 50 Ukrainians in a country outside of Ukraine (it's not clear which one) on how to use the Howitzer rounds. ""This is to train the trainers; it's a smallish number of Ukrainians, little bit more than 50 -- they will get trained on how to use the Howitzers and then they'll be able to go back into Ukraine and train their colleagues,"" the official said. The NATO question looms. Finland and Sweden are both now actively considering joining NATO, so if Putin's plan was to stop the growth of the alliance, it has officially backfired. Russia has warned such moves could lead to a more aggressive stance with regard to its hypersonic or nuclear weapons. Saber-rattling. An intercontinental ballistic missile test by Russia on Wednesday is a message to countries that try to threaten it, according to Putin. Walkout. Russia was further isolated from the world community after Western finance officials, including the US Treasury secretary, walked out of a closed-door meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized nations in Washington rather than hear a Russian presentation. What is the nuclear threat in Ukraine? CNN's Barbara Starr and Zachary Cohen report the US military is keeping a constant watch on Russia's nuclear arsenal. The US has not seen any indication Russia has moved to prepare its nuclear arsenal for use, and Starr and Cohen report that US officials still feel there is only a very remote likelihood Putin would cross that line. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned last week the world should prepare for the possibility Putin could use nuclear weapons. From Starr and Cohen: Highly classified US military plans continue to be updated about what everyone believes is an almost unthinkable scenario: the use of a nuclear weapon. The US military ""has planned all this out,"" a senior defense official said. Endnote: Life on the front lines in the Russian army. CNN's Phil Black went to an abandoned Russian military camp outside Kyiv. When the soldiers failed to take Ukraine's capital, they were left to live in primitively dug fox holes. Black talks to civilians who were captured and tortured by the Russians as well as a priest who was asked to bury people they killed. See his video report here.

2022-04-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/europe/russia-ukraine-strategy-donbas-analysis-cmd-intl/index.html,"Pushed back from Kyiv, what's Russia's military strategy now?","Phase two of Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- an offensive in the eastern Donbas region -- is underway. The question is whether it will be any more successful and competent than phase one, and whether Ukraine will have enough troops and weapons to impede or even block it. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that the operation in the Donbas is ""a very important moment of this entire special operation."" The Russian goal is clear and publicly stated: to secure all of Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk -- parts of which Russian-backed separatists have controlled since 2014. A second aim is to crush the remaining resistance in the port city of Mariupol to consolidate a land bridge linking the Russian region of Rostov with Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine eight years ago. To those ends, Russian forces that were deployed to the north and east of Kyiv have been redeployed and in some cases reconstituted after suffering heavy losses. Now they -- and fresher units -- are piling into Ukraine from the northeast. US officials estimate that Russia has mobilized some 78 battalion tactical groups in eastern Ukraine -- probably about 75,000 troops. Still more are being assembled in Russian border regions. So far, their tactics have been straight out of the Russian playbook: massive use of artillery, rocket systems and missiles followed by armor advancing. Cities in Luhansk such as Severodonetsk, Popasna and Rubizhne have been reduced to rubble, with power, gas and water supplies destroyed. But Russian progress on the ground has been modest. That may be a result of not taking time to regroup after the battering they took in February and March. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says that ""Russian forces did not take the operational pause that was likely necessary to reconstitute and properly integrate damaged units withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine into operations in eastern Ukraine."" US officials have assessed that Russia has lost up to 25% of the combat firepower it had before the invasion. Boxing the Donbas in CNN analysis of satellite imagery, dozens of social media videos and the statements of both sides suggest the Russians are now trying to advance on three axes. Imagine the Donbas as a square: Russian forces are already on three sides -- leaving only the west open to the Ukrainians for reinforcements and, if necessary, retreat. From the south and the east, forward Russian units have advanced a few kilometers at best this month. In the south they had already made progress eating into Zaporizhzhia region, which neighbors Donetsk. This week, they began shelling villages well inside Zaporizhzhia. From the north, after taking the city of Izium at the beginning of this month, they have made little further progress. What's unclear at this stage is whether the Russians can and will change gear, and a better-coordinated offensive is around the corner. The report card from the Kyiv campaign suggests otherwise, but US officials believe that for now Russia is still conducting ""shaping operations ... to make sure they have logistics and sustainment in place."" Even so, the ISW assesses that ""The Russian military is unlikely to have addressed the root causes -- poor coordination, the inability to conduct cross-country operations, and low morale -- that impeded prior offensives."" Ukrainian tactics The Ukrainians have shown themselves to be canny tacticians in this conflict, ceding territory to preserve resources but using their knowledge of the land and their mobility to inflict losses on Russian units. This week Ukrainian units withdrew from the town of Kreminna in Luhansk region when confronted with overwhelming firepower. Now they have to decide if they will mount static defenses, which could lead to units being destroyed or surrounded in the face of Russia's artillery, rockets and armored assault. The alternative is mobile defense -- fighting and withdrawing from less vital terrain, hitting the Russians as they fall back and then holding their lines in terrain of their choosing. Simultaneously the Ukrainians will look to disrupt Russian supply lines -- sowing confusion while challenging Russian logistics and morale. And morale in some Russian units -- redeployed for their second offensive in as many months -- may be brittle. One of the Russian targets is the city of Sloviansk, but the surrounding territory includes forests, rivers and marshes -- difficult to transit and requiring specialist bridging equipment. Where the Russians are confined to roads, as became clear north of Kyiv, they are more vulnerable to both Ukrainian drones and light anti-tank missiles. Nor are the Ukrainians playing defense only; in recent days small units have made modest gains east and south of Kharkiv, potentially threatening Russian supply lines. If they can sustain this, the Russians would have to dedicate units to protecting these lines. There are already signs that Ukrainian special forces are operating behind Russian lines: last week a road bridge on a main route in from Russia was blown up. There was also unexplained damage to a railway bridge inside Russia, on the edge of Belgorod. The Russian military relies on railways for much of its logistics. In this aspect of the battle, Western intelligence support may play a critical role. Another important aspect of the fight to come is cultural. Ukrainian units enjoy some autonomy and are encouraged to exploit opportunities on the battlefield. Even in the absence of clear direction or orders, they have the motivation to fight. By contrast, the Russian command chain is rigid and the culture does not encourage enterprise. Even so the Ukrainians also face considerable risks. They are fighting -- essentially -- within a box that could close if the Russians were successful in one or more directions. They will have to maneuver smartly as they did around Kyiv, constantly alert for the risk of being surrounded. When Mariupol falls, the Russians can redirect the forces that were dedicated to that assault, but they have been degraded and exhausted by nearly two months of urban combat. Above all, in a race against time, Ukraine needs a constant resupply of weapons and ammunition, much of which must now come from outside the country through a lengthy supply line vulnerable to being interdicted. They need more anti-tank weapons and mobile air defenses. Counterattacks to disrupt the Russian offensive would need to be protected from the air. On Tuesday, a senior US official said Washington was working ""around the clock"" to get weapons to Ukraine at ""unprecedented"" speed. The United States has already authorized $2.3 billion in shipments of weapons and equipment to Ukraine since the invasion. ""What is unprecedented here is the amount of successive drawdowns that we are moving at this speed,"" the official said. Aiming for Victory Day There's been some talk of the Kremlin wanting tangible progress by May 9, when Russia celebrates Victory Day marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. At the current rate of progress, that looks unlikely. The much bigger question is whether this conflict stretches into the summer, in a grim war of attrition. The Russian military would have to rotate units, drawing on limited reserves, to sustain a conflict that has already battered its ground forces. Its calculation (and the Kremlin's political strategy) will be affected by the effectiveness of Ukrainian resistance and the ability of Western governments to supply Ukraine with more and better equipment. Writing in War on the Rocks, Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute in London said: ""Ukraine's defiance has bought time and an opportunity not only to stave off further Russian gains in the Donbas, but also to shape the battle beyond it. If Ukraine's allies act today, they may deter or at least prepare for a summer offensive."" There is an urgency about resupply. Last week, the Biden administration authorized another $800 million security package, which included artillery and anti-artillery radars. On Tuesday, the President indicated more is to come. Ukraine will require offensive hardware if it's to punish any vulnerability in Russian lines, and that includes heavy armor (such as battle-ready tanks) as well as a host of other systems. Watling says there's no time to lose. ""Providing Ukraine with tactical mobile air-defense systems such as the National would allow Ukraine to maneuver near the Russian border and retake towns while raiding Russian supply lines."" The National -- or NASAMS -- is an advanced and mobile surface-to-air missile system. Western governments understand that this is a critical moment: raising the cost of Russia's ""special military operation"" to the point where it is unaffordable. The Ukrainians are crying out for even more and better weaponry, especially as they try to keep their air force flying. Still outnumbered and outgunned, they will need agility, determination and reinforcements to stave off phase two of Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine.",7,1.8638270605282496,3.474704646437924,-1.6108775859096744,13
2022-04-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/politics/ukraine-aircraft-spare-parts/index.html,"Ukraine's Air Force has added about 20 more operational aircraft after influx of spare parts, senior US defense official says","The Ukrainian Air Force has added about 20 more operational aircraft to its fleet because of an influx of spare parts, according to a senior US defense official. Though the official wouldn't specify which country had provided the aircraft parts, the official said Wednesday that the US and other countries had worked ""to get them the parts they need to get them in the air."" The flow of spare parts has allowed Ukraine to expand its fleet of operational military aircraft, despite Russia's ongoing invasion. The country has more aircraft now than it did three weeks ago, the official said. A day earlier, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Ukraine had received additional fighter aircraft to add to its numbers. But on Wednesday, the senior defense official walked that back, saying Ukraine had not received more aircraft but had in fact received aircraft parts to make more of its existing aircraft functional. Still, the official intimated that at least one country was considering sending Ukraine more aircraft. ""I was given to understand that an offer made by another country had actually been effected,"" the official said. ""That offer has not been effected, so I was ahead of where things actually were."" It is not known which country has made such an offer. The US has committed to sending Ukraine 16 Mi-17 helicopters, but the administration has declined to get involved in a transfer of MiG-29s from another country to Ukraine via the United States. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky has repeatedly asked other countries for Soviet-era MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets, which Ukrainian pilots already know how to fly. Zelensky has asked other Eastern European countries with the fourth-generation airframes to send them to Ukraine, but no country has yet agreed to do so. On Wednesday, the official Twitter account of Ukraine's Air Force said, ""Ukraine did not receive new aircraft from partners! With the assistance of the US Government, @KpsZSU received spare parts and components for the restoration and repair of the fleet of aircraft in the Armed Forces, which will allow to put into service more equipment."" Ukraine's Air Force has been part of its aerial defense network, which also includes S-300 surface-to-air missiles and portable anti-aircraft missiles. The combination of platforms has prevented Russia from establishing air superiority over Ukraine and controlling the skies. Despite the constant bombardment from Russian missiles and artillery, as well as the strikes on military bases, Ukraine's Air Force has remained largely intact, though it has suffered some losses. In early March, about two weeks into the war, the defense official said Ukraine has 56 fighter aircraft, which composed about 80% of its fixed-wing fighters. But the Ukrainians weren't using their aircraft much, flying only five to 10 missions per day, the official said. Even now, with more operational aircraft, the Ukrainian Air Force is still flying a very limited number of daily sorties, another defense official said.",49,2.371872981119129,5.1467802103883,-2.7749072292691714,21
2022-04-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/politics/us-weapons-ukraine-intelligence/index.html,What happens to weapons sent to Ukraine? The US doesn't really know,"The US has few ways to track the substantial supply of anti-tank, anti-aircraft and other weaponry it has sent across the border into Ukraine, sources tell CNN, a blind spot that's due in large part to the lack of US boots on the ground in the country -- and the easy portability of many of the smaller systems now pouring across the border. It's a conscious risk the Biden administration is willing to take. In the short term, the US sees the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of equipment to be vital to the Ukrainians' ability to hold off Moscow's invasion. A senior defense official said Tuesday that it is ""certainly the largest recent supply to a partner country in a conflict."" But the risk, both current US officials and defense analysts say, is that in the long term, some of those weapons may wind up in the hands of other militaries and militias that the US did not intend to arm. ""We have fidelity for a short time, but when it enters the fog of war, we have almost zero,"" said one source briefed on US intelligence. ""It drops into a big black hole, and you have almost no sense of it at all after a short period of time."" In making the decision to send billions of dollars of weapons and equipment into Ukraine, the Biden administration factored in the risk that some of the shipments may ultimately end up in unexpected places, a defense official said. But right now, the official said, the administration views a failure to adequately arm Ukraine as a greater risk. Because the US military is not on the ground, the US and NATO are heavily reliant on information provided by Ukraine's government. Privately, officials recognize that Ukraine has an incentive to give only information that will bolster their case for more aid, more arms and more diplomatic assistance. ""It's a war -- everything they do and say publicly is designed to help them win the war. Every public statement is an information operation, every interview, every Zelensky appearance broadcast is an information operation,"" said another source familiar with western intelligence. ""It doesn't mean they're wrong to do it in any way."" For months, US and western officials have offered detailed accounts about what the West knows about the status of Russian forces inside Ukraine: how many casualties they've taken, their remaining combat power, their weapons stocks, what kinds of munitions they are using and where. But when it comes to Ukrainian forces, officials acknowledge that the West -- including the US -- has some information gaps. Western estimates of Ukrainian casualties are also foggy, according to two sources familiar with US and western intelligence. ""It's hard to track with nobody on the ground,"" said one source familiar with the intelligence. Visibility Questions The Biden administration and NATO countries say they are providing weapons to Ukraine based on what the Ukrainian forces say they need, whether it's portable systems like Javelin and Stinger missiles or the Slovakian S-300 air defense system that was sent over the last week. Javelin and Stinger missiles and rifles and ammunition are naturally harder to track than larger systems like the S-300, which was shipped by rail. Although Javelins have serial numbers, there is little way to track their transfer and use in real time, sources familiar with the matter say. Last week the US agreed to provide Kyiv with the types of high-power capabilities some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago, including 11 Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzer cannons and 300 more Switchblade drones. But much of that support hasn't yet come online — and the Switchblades are mobile, one-time use drones that would also likely be difficult to track after the fact. ""I couldn't tell you where they are in Ukraine and whether the Ukrainians are using them at this point,"" a senior defense official told reporters last week. ""They're not telling us every round of ammunition they're firing and who and at when. We may never know exactly to what degree they've using the Switchblades."" The Defense Department doesn't earmark the weapons it sends for particular units, according to Pentagon press secretary John Kirby. Trucks loaded with pallets of arms provided by the Defense Department are picked up by Ukrainian armed forces -- primarily in Poland -- and then driven into Ukraine, Kirby said, ""then it's up to the Ukrainians to determine where they go and how they're allocated inside their country."" A congressional source pointed out that while the US is not on the ground in Ukraine, the US has tools to learn what's happening beyond what the Ukrainians are saying, noting the US has extensive use of satellite imagery and both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries appear to be using commercial communications equipment. Another congressional source said the US military's views the information it's receiving from Ukraine as generally reliable because the US has trained and equipped the Ukrainian military for eight years now, developing strong relationships. But that doesn't mean there aren't some blind spots, the source said, such as on issues like the operational status of Ukraine's S-300s. Jordan Cohen, a defense and foreign policy analyst at the CATO institute who focuses on arms sales, said the biggest danger surrounding the flood of weapons being funneled into Ukraine is what happens to them when the war ends or transitions into some kind of protracted stalemate. Such a risk is part of any consideration to send weapons overseas. For decades, the US sent arms into Afghanistan, first to arm the mujahideen in their fight against the Soviet army, then to arm Afghan forces in their fight against the Taliban. Inevitably, some weapons ended up on the black market including anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, the same kind the US is now providing to Ukraine. The United States famously scrambled to recover Stingers after the Soviet war in Afghanistan. It wasn't successful in finding all of them and when the US itself invaded Afghanistan in 2001, some officials feared that they could be used by the Taliban against the United States. Other weapons have ended up arming US adversaries. Much of what the US left behind to help Afghan forces became part of the Taliban arsenal after the collapse of the Afghan government and military. The problem is not unique to Afghanistan. Weapons sold to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates found their way into the hands of fighters linked to al-Qaeda and Iran. The risk of a similar scenario happening in Ukraine also exists, the defense official acknowledged. In 2020, the Defense Department inspector general released a report raising concerns about the end-use monitoring of weapons being sent to Ukraine. But given the nearly insatiable short-term needs of Ukrainian forces for more arms and ammunition, the long-term risk of weapons ending up on the black market or in the wrong hands was deemed acceptable, the official said. ""This could be a problem 10 years down the line, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be something we're thinking about,"" Cohen, the CATO analyst, said. ""Over 50 million rounds of ammunition -- all that ammunition isn't just going to be used to fight Russians. Eventually that ammunition is going to be misused, whether intentionally or not."" The Russian Threat Officials are less concerned -- at least for now -- that the weapons will fall into the hands of the Russians. The source briefed on the intelligence noted that Russia's failure to hold large swaths of territory or force the surrender of many Ukrainian units means that those arms have either been used or remain Ukrainian hands. And so far, it appears that Russia has struggled to intercept or destroy the supply shipments. A third source familiar with the intelligence said that it does not appear that Russia has been actively attacking western weapons shipments entering Ukraine -- although it is unclear exactly why, especially since the US has intelligence that the Russians want to and have discussed doing so both publicly and privately. There are a number of theories for why the shipments have so far been spared, this person added, including that Russian forces simply can't find them -- the weapons and equipment are being sent over in unmarked vehicles and often transported at night. It could also be that the Russian forces are running out of munitions and don't want to waste them targeting random trucks unless they can be certain they are part of an arms convoy. Though on Monday Russian claimed it had destroyed a depot ""near Lviv,"" which held ""large consignments"" of weapons provided to Ukraine by the United States and European countries. CNN has not been able to verify the claim. But broadly, Russia doesn't have perfect intelligence visibility into Ukraine, either, this source noted, and their air capabilities over western Ukraine, where the shipments are coming in, are extremely limited because of Ukrainian air defense systems. Publicly, the Pentagon says it has not yet seen Russian attempts to disrupt the weapons transfers or the shipments moving inside Ukraine. ""Flights are still going into trans-shipment sites in the region. And ground movement is still occurring of this material inside Ukraine. Every single day, there are the security assistance, weapons and material and support equipment that is getting into Ukrainian hands,"" Kirby said Thursday. ""We're going to keep doing that as much as we can, as fast as we can. We have not seen any Russian efforts to interdict that flow. And so we're just going to keep doing it,"" he added. ""We constantly look at it every day monitor it, change it, adapt it as needed.""",49,2.1776839993880084,6.30991074690292,-4.1322267475149115,8

Troops in the 64th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade were named by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense as war criminals earlier this month, after mass graves containing murdered civilians were discovered and dead bodies lay in the street following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region. In a signed letter on Monday, Putin congratulated the unit for their ""great heroism and courage"" and awarded the unit the title of ""Guards"" for ""protecting Russia's sovereignty."" ""Through astute and bold actions during the special military operation in Ukraine, the unit's staff became a role model in fulfilling its military duty, valor, dedication and professionalism,"" the president's congratulatory statement read. The move will be seen as a public message to Ukraine's government and the West, after numerous international leaders condemned the alleged atrocities by Russian troops in the Ukrainian towns of Bucha and Borodianka. Earlier this month, accounts of summary executions, brutality and indiscriminate shelling emerged in the wake of Russia's hasty retreat from central Ukraine. CNN teams saw dozens of bodies buried or strewn across the ground in the devastated suburb of Bucha, after a brutal occupation that lasted over a month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has blamed Russia for the killings and called on Moscow to stop committing ""war crimes."" The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the mass killings, while reiterating baseless claims that the images of civilian bodies on the streets of Bucha are fake. But during a visit to the towns of Bucha and Borodianka last week, International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan said there were ""reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC are being committed."" Khan also warned that it would be ""challenging"" to guarantee justice would be served in Ukraine, given Russia's decision to withdraw its signature from the ICC statute, which gives the court jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Russia does not extradite its citizens to other countries.

An ultimatum given by the Russian Defense Ministry to the last remaining Ukrainian troops still fighting in the port city has come and gone. The battle continues. Heavy fighting was still going on in Mariupol on Monday, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the city's mayor. He said Russian forces had begun issuing passes for movement within the city and that they announced entry and exit routes would be closed on Monday, warning that men remaining in the city would be ""filtered out."" That claim could not be independently verified, but Andriushchenko and other Ukrainian officials said Russian forces were bombarding the Azovstal plant, one of the city's last bastions still under Ukrainian control. The Russian military claims they have blockaded Ukrainian forces there. Myhailo Vershynin, chief of the Mariupol patrol police, told CNN the defenders inside are ""ready for fierce resistance."" ""They are aware what their fate may be, but no one is going to give up. Yesterday (the Russians) offered us a 'corridor,' they wanted us to leave without weapons, through the filtration points and then surrender,"" he told CNN in voice and text messages. ""Nobody agreed to this. No one will leave without a weapon,"" he added. 'Hell on earth' The Azovstal iron and steel works is a sprawling industrial complex in the southestern corner of Mariupol. The compound spans an area of more than four square miles and used to employ more than 10,000 people. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops are still holding out in the plant. Vershynin said that an estimated 1,000 civilians, including women, children and the elderly, were sheltering inside the plant. ""They have established their life there, provided themselves with food and water,"" he said. ""These people did not want and still do not want to go out. ... they were aware they had more chances to stay alive here."" The Commander of the Azov regiment, one of the units defending the city, said Russian forces were firing on the plant ""willingly"" as hundreds of people were sheltering inside. ""Russian occupational forces and their proxy from Luhansk People's Republic/Donetsk People's Republics know about civilians and keep their fire on the factory willingly. They use free-fall bombs, rockets, bunker-buster bombs, and all varieties of artillery, both ground and naval, for indiscriminate attacks,"" Lt. Col. Denys Prokopenko said on Telegram. The commander of the Ukrainian Marine unit in the city said Mariupol was ""what hell on earth looks like."" ""At the [Azovstal] plant, women with children and babies live in bunkers. In hunger and cold. Every day being targeted by the enemy aviation. The wounded die every day because there is no medicine, no water, no food,"" Maj. Serhii Volyna, commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, said in an open letter addressed to Pope Francis and published on the Ukrainska Pravda website on Monday. ""The time has come when praying is not enough,"" he added. The Pope has denounced the war and called for peace in his Easter Blessing on Sunday. Retired Lt. General and CNN military analyst Mark Hertling said Mariupol was a critical logistics hub. Its strategic position on the the coast of the Sea of Azov makes it a key target. Taking it would allow Russia to create a continuous land bridge from Donbas to Crimea, the peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014. ""It not only has roads, but it also has railroads and it has ports,"" Hertling said. ""It has roads going in every single direction, that road to the east goes to Rostov on Don inside of Russia, the roads to the north and northeast go to Luhansk and Donetsk, the roads to the northwest go to Zaporizhzhia and the roads to the south go down to the port city of Berdyansk. ""This next phase of the war is going to be a fight for logistics. So Mariupol is a critically important city in the eastern region it's the one they've all been fighting. Both sides have been fighting on what to control the roads, the other to prevent the control of the road when you go to the north."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the situation in Mariupol ""inhumane"" and said Russia was ""trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol."" Speaking to CNN last week, he said nobody knows how many civilians have died in Mariupol. ""Several thousand, tens of thousands, were forced to evacuate in the direction of the Russia Federation and we don't know where they are, they've left no document trail,"" Zelensky said. As fighting continued in Mariupol, it has also intensified in other parts of the country. Ukrainian officials in the Kharkiv and Luhansk regions reported heavy bombardments by Russian forces Monday, acknowledging a retreat from one important town but claiming to have successfully repulsed Russian attacks elsewhere. Meanwhile, the western city of Lviv, seen as a safe haven due to its proximity to the border, also came under attack on Monday. Maksym Kozytskyy, the Lviv regional military governor, said three missile strikes hit military warehouses that were not being used by the armed forces, and a fourth hit a tire-repair shop. Seven people have died, he said. Strategic city, nearly gone Mariupol has become the symbol of the terrifying brutality of Russia's unprovoked assault on Ukraine. But it is also a symbol of the fierce resistance of Ukrainians facing an enemy that is much more powerful. It was never a particularly picturesque city, its skyline dominated by steelworks, chemical plants and a port with a shipyard. But it has seen major improvements in recent years. Money flooded in and the quality of life improved. The parks were newly landscaped and little pockets turned into cool urban hangouts. With the improvements came a sense of pride among its residents. The city was thriving. Just weeks before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion, people in Mariupol were nervous, but didn't -- or perhaps didn't want to -- believe their hometown was in real danger. Now it's all gone. The vast majority of the southern city has been either destroyed or badly damaged. Photos and drone footage show there is hardly a street left untouched by the war. The relentless bombing has made it uninhabitable. Gone are many of its landmarks, like the famous Drama Theater that was flattened by Russian bombs last month. Its streets, where little coffee shops and trendy restaurants were beginning to pop up, are covered in debris and dust. An estimated 100,000 people remain in Mariupol and its immediate surroundings. They have no way out.",47,5.931067751402516,1.64017633139111,4.290891420011405,24

""What we have seen over the last few days is them continue to try to set the conditions,"" the senior defense official said in a call with reporters on Monday. ""We call it shaping operations."" ""It appears as if they are trying to learn from the failed lessons of the north where they didn't have proper sustainment capabilities in the area they were about to operate,"" the official said. The official said that the US has seen Russia moving in ""heavy artillery,"" ""command and control enablers"" and ""aviation, particularly rotary aviation support"" as part of the 11 new battalion tactical groups that have moved into the east and south of Ukraine ""over the last few days."" Russia is massing troops and appears close to taking the southeastern port city of Mariupol. CNN reported on Monday that the fate of Mariupol is hanging on an unknown number of defenders making their last stand at an iron and steel plant. Heavy fighting was still going on in the city on Monday, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the city's mayor. Later on Monday Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said the ""second phase of the war"" had begun in the eastern Donbas region, amid clear signs of a stepped-up Russian offensive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the battle for Donbas had begun in a video address on Monday. ""Russian forces have started the battle for Donbas for which they've been preparing for a long time and a considerable amount of the Russian forces are concentrated and focused on that offensive,"" Zelensky said. He underscored that Ukrainian forces will continue to fight against a Russian incursion in the region. ""No matter how many Russian servicemen they're bringing into that area, we will keep on fighting and defending and we will be doing this daily. We will not give up anything that is Ukrainian but we don't need anything that is not ours,"" Zelensky said. ""I'm thankful to all of our warriors, our soldiers, our heroic towns and towns in the region who are resisting and standing firm,"" he said. Russia's disjointed — and at times chaotic — operation in the north of Ukraine has been well-documented and their early military failures largely came as a surprise to US and western officials. Since Russia launched its assault on Ukraine on February 24, it has bombarded Ukrainian cities with missiles and artillery, destroying apartments, hospitals and schools and leaving scores of civilians dead. But its ground invasion has largely stalled and Moscow has failed to seize key cities, including Kyiv, amid fierce resistance from the Ukrainians and what senior defense officials have described as tactical errors. Russia focusing on east and south The US assesses that Russia has added 11 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) to their forces in the east and south since late last week, according to the senior US defense official, bringing Russia's total number of BTGs to 76. ""They have added to their capability inside Ukraine,"" the official said. The official said that all Russian ground forces are currently focused in the east and south of Ukraine, but the US is unable to pinpoint exactly how the new BTGs are spread out. In preparation for a new type of fight on the open plains of southeast Ukraine right next to Russia, the US is providing Kyiv with the types of high-power capabilities some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago. The new, $800 million weapons package represents the starkest sign to date that the war in Ukraine is shifting -- and with it, the weapons Ukraine will need if it hopes to continue to stymie a Russian military that has regrouped and resupplied after its initial failures in the opening weeks of the war. The Biden administration announced that the new package included 11 Mi-17 helicopters that had initially been earmarked for Afghanistan, 18 155 mm Howitzer cannons and 300 more Switchblade drones, in addition to radar systems capable of tracking incoming fire and pinpointing its origin. This package stands out from previous security assistance in part because this tranche includes more sophisticated and heavier-duty weaponry than previous shipments. A US official told CNN last week that's by design, arguing that because Russia, which was unable to capture Kyiv, has shifted its strategy to concentrate forces in eastern Ukraine, the US is shifting its own strategy in what it gives Ukraine. ""The contours of what they need is very different,"" the US official said. Several of the weapons systems are complex enough that the Pentagon has said it will need to provide training for Ukrainians outside the country, as was previously provided for the Switchblade drones, with the senior defense official saying that training on the Howitzers will begin ""in the next several days."" ""We'll try to get opportunities for a small number of Ukrainians to be familiarized with these systems,"" said Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby at a briefing with reporters last week, ""but we don't believe that it's going to be an onerous task or lengthy in time or in resources.""

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the city, which has been surrounded by Russian troops since March 1, has not fallen. Ukrainian troops trapped in the city are holding out against the Russian onslaught despite overwhelming odds. But they are confined to pockets of resistance, and their numbers are unclear. ""There are still our military forces, our soldiers, so they will fight until the end and as for now they are still in Mariupol,"" Shmyhal said on ABC News' ""This Week."" An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol also rejected the Russian ultimatum earlier on Sunday. Petro Andriushchenko said on Telegram ""as of today, our defenders continue to hold the defense."" The comments come after Russia's Ministry of Defense called on the Ukrainian soldiers still in Mariupol to surrender by 1 p.m. local time Sunday, warning anyone still resisting after the deadline ""will be eliminated."" The ministry later confirmed the ultimatum had been ignored. In a statement, the Russian ministry said the surrounded Ukrainian soldiers ""were offered to voluntarily lay down arms and surrender in order to save their lives."" ""However, the Kiev nationalist regime, according to the radio intercept, forbade negotiations about surrendering,"" the Ministry claimed. It also asserted, according to Ukrainian soldiers who had previously surrendered, ""there are up to 400 foreign mercenaries who joined the Ukrainian forces"" trapped at the plant, including Europeans and Canadians. ""In case of further resistance, all of them will be eliminated,"" it said. Shmyhal, Ukraine's prime minister, said despite the relentless Russian attacks, ""not one big city in Ukraine has fallen."" ""Only Kherson is under control of Russian military forces, but all of the rest of the cities are under Ukrainian control,"" he said, adding some of the cities in the surrounding areas were ""besieged but still under Ukrainian control."" He said more than 900 Ukrainian cities, towns and villages had been freed from Russian occupation since Moscow took control after the invasion began in late February. ""We still are fighting, and we have battle in Donbas region right now, but we do not have intention to surrender,"" Shmyhal said. How Mariupol is faring The situation in Mariupol is desperate. Much of the city has been destroyed by Russian shelling. Civilian structures targeted included a maternity hospital and a theater where up to 1,300 people were seeking refuge. The military governor of Ukraine's Donetsk region, where Mariupol is located, said Tuesday up to 22,000 people may have died in the city. CNN cannot verify the figures, as there are no independent casualty figures from the fighting in the city available. Though many have fled, an estimated 100,000 people still remain in Mariupol and its immediate surroundings, which are reported to be largely under Russian control. According to Russian state media, most of the Ukrainian defenders are located in the Azovstal steel works, one of the largest such plants in Europe with a network of rail tracks and furnaces. Andriushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said resistance to the Russians continued beyond the plant. ""Despite the occupiers' desire to show that the place of hostilities is limited to the Azovstal Steel Plant, this does not correspond with reality,"" Andriushchenko said. ""Last night there were fights on the Taganrog Street that is located five kilometers away from Azovstal."" He said ""during the fighting, the occupiers shelled private residential houses with heavy artillery again. The shelling of the port area also continued."" On Saturday during a late-night address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the situation in Mariupol ""inhuman"" and ""as severe as possible."" He and his administration had been trying every day to end the siege through both military and diplomatic channels, he said. ""Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol,"" he said in the video address. In a separate article posted on the presidential website, Zelensky said he was open to talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but negotiations would be impossible if further Russian war crimes surface. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Sunday the situation in Mariupol ""may be a red line"" in negotiations with Russia. ""The situation in Mariupol is both dire militarily and heartbreaking,"" Kuleba said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""The city doesn't exist anymore. The remaining of the Ukrainian army and a large group of civilians are basically encircled by the Russian forces. They continue their struggle, but it seems from the way the Russian army behaves in Mariupol, they decided to raze the city to the ground at any cost,"" he added. The foreign minister said he is anticipating the intensification of heavy fighting in eastern Ukraine in the ""coming weeks."" He also said he expects ""desperate attempts of the Russia forces to finish with Mariupol at any cost,"" adding he anticipates missile attacks on Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine to continue. Russia claims advances into Mariupol On Friday, the Russian military claimed it had made advances into Mariupol. ""The grouping of Russian troops and units of the Donetsk people's militia have completely liberated Illich Steelworks from Ukrainian nationalists as a result of the offensive in Mariupol city,"" said Russian military spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov in a statement. CNN cannot independently verify the claim. This came two days after the last remaining defenders in Mariupol carried out a ""risky maneuver"" to join forces and consolidate their defenses, according to Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych. Both units have been involved in a last-ditch attempt to resist the Russian offensive. However, one of the unit commanders in Mariupol acknowledged some Ukrainian defenders had surrendered. In a statement earlier this week, members of the Ukrainian Marines posted a video statement vowing to fight on ""until the end,"" despite being surrounded by Russian forces and running low on supplies. ""We did not give up our positions,"" the Marines said in the video. Ukrainian officials have warned of a major humanitarian emergency in Mariupol as food and water run out, with electricity and gas cut, urging the establishment of evacuation corridors to allow civilians to escape. But several attempts have failed, including an evacuation effort Saturday, with wet weather halting operations. Buses were unable to travel through a washed-out section of road between the town of Vasylivka and Zaporizhzhia to its north, according to a social media post by Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. Instead, people leaving Mariupol, Berdiansk, Tokmak and Enerhodar cities were told to get to Zaporizhzhia themselves. No evacuation routes are planned for Sunday because Ukrainian officials have been unable to agree on routes with the Russians. Vereshchuk said on her Telegram channel: ""We again demand providing the humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians, especially women and children from Mariupol."" She added: ""Through the relevant international organisations we also demand from the occupiers to open a special corridor for the evacuation of wounded soldiers from Mariupol."" Vereshchuk said Saturday 170 people did manage to escape from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia with their own means of transport of Saturday, but most of Mariupol's residents remain stuck in the city, facing constant bombardment.",47,1.5865159131552788,4.6040793768612485,-3.0175634637059696,24
2022-04-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/16/europe/russia-ukraine-war-retaliation-intl/index.html,'We all realize that we will not be forgiven.' Ukraine braces for new assault after sinking of Russian flagship,"The war in Ukraine could soon enter a new, even more dangerous phase. Russia, angry over the loss of its Black Sea Fleet flagship, has warned of ""unpredictable consequences"" if the US continues supplying weapons to Ukraine, while Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky struck a somber note telling CNN the world should be prepared for the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use tactical nuclear weapons. The sinking of the guided-missile cruiser Moskva on Thursday is the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years -- and a huge embarrassment for Russia. It comes at a time when US intelligence officials are warning about Putin's increasingly unpredictable behavior and willingness to take risks due to his anger over Russia's failures in Ukraine. While Moscow has denied the Ukrainian version of events -- that the Moskva sunk after being struck by Ukrainian missiles -- it was nevertheless forced to admit the ship went down. Russia has insisted the reason for the sinking was a fire, but the US on Friday confirmed Ukraine's account, with a senior defense official saying that the US believes that two Ukrainian Neptune missiles hit the Russian warship. As the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva was one of its most visible assets in the Ukraine war and its loss could impact the morale of Russian troops. Tellingly, the Russian government has not acknowledged casualties in the sinking of the ship, a marked contrast to the very public discussion about the Kursk submarine disaster, which claimed the lives of 118 sailors in 2000. Russia may have extinguished independent media, but the loss of the Moskva has likely made Putin even more furious about the situation in Ukraine. US officials believe Putin is angry over the failures of his troops in Ukraine. They believe Putin's advisers have not been telling him the full truth and did not prepare him for potential setbacks. The warship fiasco comes just weeks after top Russian military officials announced a shift in the focus of the invasion after their offensive appeared to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. Russia has also failed to achieve complete air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses of personnel since the start of the invasion. Russia was quick to strike back. Ukraine's Operational Command South said in a statement early Saturday that the situation in Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions was ""increasingly hostile."" ""Desperately trying to gain a foothold and hold on to the positions of the southern front, the world's most shameful army is pursuing civilians in Mykolayiv and Kherson regions. The work of snipers has been recorded in some areas."" The statement said Russian forces were ""enraged by the losses in the Black Sea"" and had ""intensified the missile threat"" in the region. Natalia Humeniuk, the spokeswoman for the armed forces in southern Ukraine, said that the missile attacks since Thursday night were in retaliation for the Moskva sinking. ""We all realize that we will not be forgiven,"" she said, accusing Russia of using ""cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions."" The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has previously said it had received credible allegations that Russian armed forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas in Ukraine. The nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) has also confirmed Russia's use of cluster munitions throughout the conflict. Zelensky has on Friday praised the Ukrainian armed forces for repelling Russian attacks, saying they were ""doing it brilliantly."" Zelensky has also praised the help Ukraine was getting from western countries, but has asked for more weapons to be shipped to the country. ""The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be and the sooner peace will come,"" he said. More weapons for Ukraine In another sign that the war in Ukraine is not going the way Russia has planned, Moscow has formally protested America's ongoing shipment of weapons to Ukraine. It sent a diplomatic note to the State Department warning of ""unpredictable consequences"" should the support continue, according to two US officials and another source familiar with the document. Some Biden administration officials believe that the diplomatic note shows the Russians are hurting, one official said. The official explained that they believe the Russians would not have sent that message if they felt they were in a strong place on the battlefield. The note, known as a demarche, was sent earlier this week as the US administration was preparing to announce that it would be sending a new military aid package worth $800 million to the Ukrainians. The EU has also approved an additional 500 million euros for military equipment for Ukraine. For the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US is providing Kyiv with high-power capabilities that some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago. These include Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzers and 300 more Switchblade drones. These types of weapons are designed for the type of fighting that's likely to take place in the Donbas region — open terrain rather than urban and wooded areas. The US is also shipping 40,000 artillery rounds, but that amount could be expended within several days if fighting in the east grows heavier. During previous battles, Ukrainian forces fired thousands of artillery rounds in a day, a US official said Saturday. There are growing concerns about the need to get more ammunition, in particular artillery ammunition, to Ukrainian forces more rapidly, a US official said. The Ukrainian military and regional officials have said Russian attacks have intensified in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east of the country as they prepare for a major ground offensive there. Going forward, US officials believe the likely Russia strategy is to move weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine from their current positions just north and then encircle and cut off Ukraine forces that are there, the official said. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley are conducting daily phone calls with counterparts in the region to encourage them to ship more weapons and supplies to Ukraine as soon as possible. Serhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk region military administration, has warned civilians who remain in Luhansk to leave the area. ""It is extremely dangerous to stay in the cities now. The shelling intensified,"" he said. The Ukrainian armed forces General Staff said that ""the main focus of the Russian enemy is on the regrouping and strengthening of troops"" around Slobozhansky, an area that is a short distance south of Kharkiv. In the same area, according to the General Staff, Russian forces have concentrated up to 22 battalion tactical groups around Izium. A battalion tactical group normally comprises about 1,000 troops.",7,2.427790753163179,2.878213321064167,-0.4504225679009881,13
2022-04-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/14/europe/ukraine-war-russia-trucks-logistics-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,What images of Russian trucks say about its military's struggles in Ukraine,"Think about modern warfare and it's likely images of soldiers, tanks and missiles will spring to mind. But arguably more important than any of these is something on which they all rely: the humble truck. Armies need trucks to transport their soldiers to the front lines, to supply those tanks with shells and to deliver those missiles. In short, any army that neglects its trucks does so at its peril. Yet that appears to be exactly the problem Russia's military is facing during its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, according to experts analyzing battlefield images as its forces withdraw from areas near Kyiv to focus on the Donbas. Photographs of damaged Russian trucks, they say, show tell-tale signs of Moscow's logistical struggles and suggest its efforts are being undermined by its reliance on conscripts, widespread corruption and use of civilian vehicles -- not to mention the huge distances involved in resupplying its forces, or Ukraine's own highly-motivated, tactically-adept resistance. ""Everything that an army needs to do its thing comes from a truck,"" says Trent Telenko, a former quality control auditor for the United States' Defense Contract Management Agency, who is among those parsing the images for clues as to how the war is going. ""The weapon isn't the tank, it's the shell the tank fires. That shell travels by a truck,"" Telenko points out. Food, fuel, medical supplies and even the soldiers themselves -- the presence of all of these rest on logistical supply lines heavily reliant on trucks, he says. And he has reason to believe there's a problem with those supply lines. Canary in the coal mine Telenko describes one recent photo of tire damage on a multimillion-dollar mobile missile truck, a Pantsir S1, as the canary in the coal mine for Russia's logistical efforts. As such an expensive piece of equipment, he would have expected its maintenance to be first-rate. Yet its tires were crumbling just a few weeks into the war -- what Telenko refers to as ""a failure mode."" If trucks are not moved frequently the rubber in their tires becomes brittle and the tire walls vulnerable to cracks and tears. Telenko says the problem is common when tires are run with low inflation to cope with the sort of muddy conditions that Russian forces are facing in the Ukrainian spring. For Telenko, who for more than a decade specialized in maintenance problems in the US military's truck fleet, the condition of the Pantsir S1 is a revealing mistake. ""If you're not doing (preventive maintenance) for something so important, then it's very clear the entire truck fleet was treated similarly,"" he says. Telenko's theory has echoes of US World War II Gen. Omar Bradley's famous quote that ""amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics."" And he is not the first to have detected a lack of professionalism in Russia's military, which includes hundreds of thousands of conscripts. In one notorious incident early in the war, a 40-mile (64-kilometer) convoy of Russian tanks, armored vehicles, and towed artillery became stalled 19 miles (30 km) outside Kyiv, bogged down according to Britain's Ministry of Defense not only by Ukrainian resistance but ""mechanical breakdowns"" too. Last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told CNN's Don Lemon that Russia had made ""missteps"" and ""struggled with logistics,"" while on Saturday a senior US defense official said the Russians had still not solved ""their logistics and sustainment problems"" and would be unable to reinforce their forces in eastern Ukraine ""with any great speed."" Another 'bad sign' Phillips O'Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, sees another ""bad sign"" for Russian truck logistics: its use of civilian trucks to replace military ones lost in battle. ""Civilian trucks are not made to military grade. They're not made to carry the loads, they're not made to carry the specific pieces of equipment,"" and in many cases cannot even operate off roads, O'Brien says. The rigors of war are already trying enough for the sturdiest military grade truck, let alone a civilian one. ""A single mile in peacetime, if you drive it in wartime is like 10 or 20 miles (16 to 32 km) because you are pushing the truck hard with huge payloads,"" O'Brien says. Switching between the two introduces a maintenance problem, as spare parts may not be compatible. And, as O'Brien points out, ""You don't want to have to get a new truck every time an old one breaks down."" Compounding the problem, according to Alex Vershinin, a former US Army officer who served four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, is that when vehicles do break down Russia has limited resources to recover them. The Russian army's battalion tactical groups -- those at the spearhead of its advances into Ukraine -- normally have only one light and one heavy recovery vehicle, even in units featuring dozens of vehicles, Vershinin wrote last month for the US Military Academy's Modern War Institute. This means combat vehicles sometimes need to be diverted to towing duties and sometimes broken down ""vehicles need to be towed up to a hundred miles,"" wrote Vershinin. O'Brien suggests Russia has neglected its trucks largely because they are not glitzy enough for a military keen to show off its cutting edge weapons systems. In recent years, Putin has boasted about Russia's hypersonic missiles like the Zircon and Kinzhal, stealth fighter jets like the Su-57, and its modern fleet of 11 ballistic missile submarines. ""Often glamorous dictator militaries are good at the showy weapons, they buy the fancy aircraft and the fancy tanks, but they don't actually buy the less glamorous stuff,"" O'Brien says. Conscription and corruption At the root of Russia's logistical problems, experts say, are two things that plague its military: conscription and corruption. About 25% of the Russian military's million troops are conscripts, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies -- though many experts believe that figure may be misleading, suspecting some of the non-conscript troops are either coerced or tricked into enlisting. Russia's conscripts tend to serve one-year stints, occupy the lower ranks, and fill many of the positions in the logistics chain, including vehicle maintenance. ""You can't really learn anything in a year about maintaining military systems,"" Telenko says. Conscripts also have little motivation as they know their time in the job is so limited, he says. A senior US defense official said Wednesday said Washington is seeing morale problems among Russia's conscripts, who make up ""almost half"" of its forces in Ukraine. ""We have evidence, even recent evidence, that they have been disillusioned by this war, weren't properly informed, weren't properly trained, weren't ready, not just physically but weren't ready mentally for what they were about to do,"" the US official said. By contrast, in the US military vehicle maintenance is handled by a volunteer non-commissioned officer corps, professional sergeants and corporals who stay for extended enlistments and are motivated by pay rises and promotions. ""You want to have as good people maintaining logistics as you do for every other branch,"" says O'Brien, at the University of St Andrews. He adds, in reference to Russia's apparent struggles, ""Were they in a shape for a logistics war or did they not just take it seriously?"" Then there is the corruption that experts say has dogged the Russian military for years. Matthew Stephenson, a Harvard Law School professor and editor in chief of the Global Anti-corruption Blog, wrote in March that corruption had a particularly corrosive effect on the Russian military's maintenance and supply logistics. ""All of these problems that anti-corruption experts and national security specialists had been emphasizing for years do seem to be manifesting in the current Russian invasion,"" he wrote. ""Corruption -- in the form of embezzlement or bribery -- can also lead to the purchase of substandard equipment, for example by giving the contract for equipment or maintenance to a less qualified supplier that is more willing to pay kickbacks. Or the person in charge of allocating the maintenance or procurement budget can simply report spending the full budgeted amount on high quality products or services, but then purchase low quality substitutes and pocket the difference. Telenko's view is that some of the effects are now being seen on the battlefield. He says money that should have been used for maintenance is ""likely lining the pockets of officers in charge of the conscripts who would be servicing the trucks."" A truck too far? There are other, subtler, signs of Russian struggles that might easily be missed by anyone who isn't logistically minded, experts say. For instance, says Alex Lord, Europe and Eurasia analyst at the Sibylline strategic analysis firm in London, Russia's military has historically relied on its large manpower reserves to handle logistics, rather than mechanized systems using wooden pallets and forklifts. Telenko gives the example of loading artillery shells onto a truck. A forklift can lift a pallet of two dozen shells in a single go, while manually lifting individual shells onto a truck would consume far more time and manpower. This makes Russian logistics around 30% less efficient than leading Western militaries, says Jason Crump, CEO of Sibylline and a veteran of 20 years in the British military. ""This means that it takes more trucks to do a given task in the same time, so greater fuel use and wear and tear,"" Crump says. It also means Russian trucks spend more time standing still while loading and unloading, according to Lord. ""This provides opportunities for Ukrainian forces to target them -- as we have seen Ukrainian commanders exploit numerous times during the current campaign,"" he says. All these problems only exacerbate the problems facing Moscow in what is already an uphill struggle for its forces given the distances involved. Trucks can usually operate up to 90 miles (145 kilometers) from their supply depot, Telenko points out. But Ukraine is about the size of Texas, almost 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) wide and 350 miles (563 kilometers) long. That means Russia would need to open numerous supply depots inside Ukraine for its troops to advance farther into Ukraine's interior. With Moscow already pulling back under fierce Ukrainian resistance that seems like a tall order. Russia is already thought to have lost a substantial number of trucks. Building more to replace them could take at least six months, Telenko estimates, by which time more losses would be likely. ""I don't see how the Russians can maintain their current positions, let alone make any offensive moves with their current truck fleet,"" he says. ""Trucks are the backbone of any modern mechanized military force, and if you don't have them you walk."" And if",7,4.176686944574381,3.179975582910523,0.9967113616638574,23

A US official tells CNN that's by design, arguing that because Russia, which was unable to capture Kyiv, has shifted its strategy to concentrate forces in eastern Ukraine, the US is shifting its own strategy in what it gives Ukraine. ""The contours of what they need is very different,"" the US official said. The newly authorized package was announced days after national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley spent more than two hours on the phone with their Ukrainian counterparts reviewing requests. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke with Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov twice in the last week. Reznikov gave an update of the situation on the ground, which allowed Austin to determine what weapons Ukraine most needed. Biden delivered the news of the assistance package during a 58-minute phone call with Zelensky from the Oval Office on Wednesday. There was one item Zelensky asked Biden for directly: Mi-17 helicopters. According to a source familiar, the helicopters had initially not been included in the package as of Tuesday night because US officials weren't clear on whether the Ukrainians wanted or needed them at this time. Zelensky made clear to the President on Wednesday that they did. 'A little bit like Kansas' The weapons being provided are focused on the type of fighting that's likely to take place in the Donbas region -- open terrain rather than the close fighting in urban and wooded areas that's occurred in areas around Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. The region also borders southwest Russia, allowing Russian forces to avoid the sorts of sustainment, logistics and communication problems that derailed their all-out invasion of the country nearly from the beginning. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday that the package was tailored to the fight in Donbas, a topography he described as ""a little bit like Kansas."" ""It's a little bit flatter. It's a little bit more open. And it's the kind of place where we can anticipate that the Russians will want to use tanks and long-range fires, artillery and rocket fire to achieve some of their objectives before committing ground troops,"" Kirby said. The new weapons package, Kirby added, was ""very much an effort to give the Ukrainians every possible advantage in this fight that's coming."" The Biden administration has faced bipartisan pressure to do more to help Ukraine, particularly in calls to send more powerful weapons. But the administration resisted for weeks, wary of how Russian President Vladimir Putin, with his forces already deployed, would respond. Officials warned the Kremlin may see it as escalatory or an indication that the United States was joining the fight. The issue was most acutely felt with the MiG-29 fighter jets Ukraine requested. The administration refused to take part in a transfer of the Soviet-era jets from a third country to Ukraine via the United States, rejecting a proposal from Poland. The US worried, Kirby said on March 9, that ""the transfer of combat aircraft right now could be mistaken by Mr. Putin and the Russians as an escalatory step."" A large part of the concern internally was over the proposal to fly them into Ukraine from a NATO air base. Now the rhetoric of the Biden administration appears to have shifted along with the scope of the war. As the US prepares to send in the types of weapons it has not sent since the invasion began, the Pentagon insisted this was part of the US commitment ""from the very beginning"" to help Ukraine defend itself. ""How that gets interpreted by the Russians -- you can ask Mr. Putin and the Kremlin,"" Kirby said Wednesday. 'Very quickly in a different place' For weeks, Zelensky pleaded with world leaders for more arms and equipment. In March, he spoke with the parliaments of 17 countries, as well as three international organizations. He never strayed far from his core message: Ukraine needs more weapons. He asked Congress for new air defense systems to help defend Ukraine's skies. He requested 1% of NATO's tanks and planes to fight back against Russian forces. And he sought more weapons from Belgium, warning that if Ukraine loses, the European Union loses. But his calls for heavier firepower went largely unanswered. For the most part, countries sent more small arms ammunition, anti-armor missiles and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as protective and medical equipment. Now, with Russian forces preparing for a massive assault on the Donbas region, the tide is turning. ""The envelope of what people are prepared to provide has grown considerably in the last couple of weeks,"" the US official said. Once Ukrainian forces were able to hold off the Russian invasion for the first few days, it put the options for security assistance ""very quickly in a different place."" Slovakia provided Ukraine with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. The Czech Republic sent in T-72 tanks. The United Kingdom announced that it would ship 120 armored vehicles to Ukraine. And now the United States has authorized a range of new and more powerful weapons. As a sign of the coordination on assistance to Ukraine, the European Union announced it would provide another $544 million in aid on the same day the White House authorized its own $800 million. Pentagon says it's working as quickly as possible The package announced Wednesday marked the first time the US was providing Ukraine with howitzer cannons. Kirby said that several systems would require additional training for the Ukrainians to use them, including the howitzers and counter-artillery radars. Many of the weapons that are being directed toward Ukraine are heavier, making them more difficult to transport across the country. Ukraine has collected the weapons provided to date from the US and other countries at its western border before moving them to forces around the country. Kirby said the Pentagon knows ""time is not our friend"" as Russia prepares its next offensive but that it's working to move equipment into Ukraine's hands as quickly as possible: ""Even before this was announced, we had been moving at very, very fast speed all the other security assistance that we've been providing, frankly at an unprecedented rate."" The Pentagon hosted the CEOs of the military's eight largest prime contractors Wednesday to figure out how to arm Ukraine faster, according to a readout of the classified meeting. The roundtable discussion, led by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, focused on the Pentagon's objectives to keep supplying Ukraine with arms while being able to maintain the readiness of US forces and support the defense of allies.

2022-04-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/osce-moscow-mechanism-report-ukraine-russia/index.html,OSCE report finds 'clear patterns' of violations of international humanitarian law by Russian forces in Ukraine,"An expert report from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) found ""clear patterns"" of violations of international humanitarian law by Russian forces in Ukraine and detailed numerous incidents that it says could constitute war crimes. The report says it found ""credible evidence"" suggesting violations of ""even the most fundamental human rights (right to life, prohibition of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment) have been committed, mostly in the areas under the effective control of Russia or entities under overall control of Russia."" In a statement at the OSCE on Wednesday, US Ambassador Michael Carpenter said that ""taken as a whole, the report documents the catalog of inhumanity perpetrated by Russia's forces in Ukraine."" 'Documenting the sheer scope' ""The report is powerful in documenting the sheer scope of the Russian government's cruelty,"" Carpenter said. The 110-page report details reports of targeted killings, torture, rape and forced disappearances. The OSCE fact-finding mission ""received several reports, sometimes accompanied by photographic evidence, alleging the use by Russian troops of the red cross emblem to mark military non-medical vehicles, of Ukrainian flags, army or police uniforms or vehicles, white flags, civilian clothes, and OSCE symbols to facilitate their military operations,"" it says. It includes reports of a Ukrainian interpreter who was ""held in captivity for nine days"" by Russian forces. Left in an icy cellar, he was repeatedly beaten with an iron bar and rifle butts, tortured with electricity, deprived of food for 48 hours and subjected to a mock execution. It includes the report of a woman who was raped multiple times, ""in the presence of her small child,"" by a ""drunken Russian soldier"" who killed her husband. ""There are allegations of rapes, including gang rapes, committed by Russian soldiers in many other regions in Ukraine,"" the report states. It cites the Human Rights Ombudsperson of the Ukrainian Parliament, who said that ""500,000 civilians have been deported from Ukraine to Russia"" and ""that all of them had been forcibly displaced, first brought to some filtration camps in Russia near the Ukrainian border and that some of them were then brought as far as Sakhalin Island, but left there in freedom."" For many of the incidents, the report says they would constitute war crimes, but does not fully declare them as such. On the attack on the maternity hospital in Mariupol, however, it states: ""This attack therefore constitutes a clear violation of (international humanitarian law) and those responsible for it have committed a war crime."" ""While it may be that one hospital was used by the defender for military purposes or destroyed by mistake, it is hardly possible that this is the case when 50 hospitals are destroyed,"" the report states. It notes the ""particularly insidious form of attack"" known as ""double tap attacks"" that Russian forces allegedly carried out in Kharkiv in early March. A Russian cruise missile hit the Kharkiv regional administration -- and a second strike hit the building after rescuers arrived several minutes later. 'Not conceivable' The report was the result of a three-week-long fact-finding mission by the three OSCE experts, and covers the time period from the start of the war on February 24 to April 1. That mission was launched after 45 countries triggered the OSCE's Moscow Mechanism, which is used to look into allegations of human rights abuses. The report notes that the experts faced a number of limitations -- time and resource constraints, lack of access to Ukraine -- so ""a detailed assessment of most allegations of IHL violations and the identification of war crimes and crimes against humanity concerning particular incidents has not been possible."" However, ""it is not conceivable that so many civilians would have been killed and injured and so many civilian objects, including houses, hospitals, cultural property, schools, multi-story residential buildings, administrative buildings, penitentiary institutions, police stations, water stations and electricity systems would have been damaged or destroyed if Russia had respected its (international humanitarian law) obligations in terms of distinction, proportionality and precautions in conducting hostilities in Ukraine,"" it notes. The report did not cover the time period when developments like the atrocities in Bucha came to light, which it says ""require serious national and international enquiries, on the spot, with forensic experts."" It states that ""if confirmed, such killings would constitute egregious violations of (international humanitarian law) and war crimes."" The report says that ""violations occurred on the Ukrainian as well as on the Russian side."" ""The violations committed by the Russian Federation, however, are by far larger in nature and scale,"" it adds. Most of the reported violations by Ukraine are related to the treatment of Russian soldiers. The report also notes that Russia, which is a member of the OSCE, did not give additional information to the fact-finding mission, and instead ""referred the Mission to the official statements and briefings of the Government of the Russian Federation, which made it impossible for the Mission to take account of the Russian position on all pertinent incidents, except based on official open sources and websites."" ""The Permanent Representation of the Russian Federation informed the Mission upon request that it considered the Moscow Mechanism largely outdated and redundant,"" the report said. 'More detailed investigations are necessary' The OSCE report welcomed the work being done by other organizations -- the International Criminal Court (ICC), the United Nations, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) -- to investigate the crimes being committed in Ukraine. ""More detailed investigations are necessary, in particular with regard to establish individual criminal responsibility for war crimes,"" it states. Carpenter, the US Ambassador to the OSCE, told reporters that ""the information and evidence that was collected by the fact finding mission ... will be shared with other jurisdictions, such as the ICC and the ICJ. It can also be shared with national courts that may claim jurisdiction."" Carpenter did not rule out the possibility that the Moscow Mechanism could be triggered to look into further reports of atrocities being committed in Ukraine.

2022-04-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/europe/nehammer-putin-meeting-connect-the-world-intl/index.html,Austria's Chancellor met with Putin to 'confront' him with atrocities he saw in Ukraine,"Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he went to Moscow to ""look in President Putin's eyes and confront him with what I saw"" in Ukraine, he told CNN Wednesday. Nehammer said he raised alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine during a ""tough"" and unfriendly meeting Monday with Vladimir Putin -- the first Western sit-down with the Russian President since he launched his invasion of Ukraine in February. ""This is not a friendly visit. I have just come from Ukraine and have seen with my own eyes the immeasurable suffering caused by the Russian war of aggression,"" Nehammer was quoted as saying in a statement issued by his office after the meeting outside Moscow. ""I made the decision to go to Moscow, to look in President Putin's eyes and confront him with what I saw,"" the Chancellor said in an interview with CNN's Becky Anderson Wednesday. When asked about Putin's mindset during the meeting, Nehammer said Putin was very tough and clear in his messages. ""In his point of view he has to defend the Russian Federation, the Russians living in eastern Ukraine,"" he said. Putin has long accused Ukraine of violating the rights of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in the country, and framed his invasion as a ""special mission"" to protect Russian speakers -- particularly in the eastern Donbas region -- from genocide at the hands of ​""neo-Nazis."" Until the February invasion, Donbas had been the site of a low-intensity war between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces in which thousands have died since 2014. His claims of genocide and state neo-Nazism are both baseless. Nehammer said Putin mentioned the Istanbul peace talks, and the Austrian chancellor emphasized he sees an opportunity in those talks to end the war. The Chancellor said he confronted Putin about war crime and told him ""it's necessary to have international justice, the United Nations there."" Nehammer said, ""it's not easy for Putin to talk about war crimes."" Asked whether Putin accepted there are war crimes bring committed, Nehammer responded, ""Well, you know, It's President Putin. In this position, he was not clear."" A divisive visit Nehammer is the first European leader to meet Putin face-to-face since his invasion. His visit divided opinion among EU leaders, with some expressing skepticism about engaging with the Russian leader. The pair spoke for about 75 minutes at Putin's Novo-Ogaryovo residence near Moscow, Nehammer's spokesperson said on Monday, in talks the Austrian leader described as ""very direct, open and tough."" Before visiting Russia, Nehammer met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Saturday and visited the town of Bucha, where bodies of unarmed civilians were found strewn across public streets after a month of Russian occupation. ''I addressed the serious war crimes in Bucha and other places and emphasized that all those responsible for them must be held accountable,"" Nehammer said, according to the statement issued by his office. ""I also told President Putin in no uncertain terms that sanctions against Russia will remain in place and will continue to be tightened as long as people are dying in Ukraine."" The Austrian leader said Putin had blamed the Ukrainians for ""being responsible for the crimes in Bucha."" Video footage, however, shows Russian forces gunning down a civilian there. Austria is militarily neutral but its government has joined its neighbors in condemning Putin's invasion. The Chancellor said he raised the issue of evacuation corridors with Putin, after repeated instances in which attempted evacuations around Ukraine have been scuppered by Russian attacks. Ukrainian officials said a Russian strike on Kramatorsk train station on Friday killed dozens of people, including several children. ""I also made it clear to the Russian President that there is an urgent need for humanitarian corridors to bring drinking water and food to the besieged cities and to bring out women, children and the wounded,"" Nehammer said in his statement. Nehammer cited ""a sense of responsibility to leave no stone unturned"" as a reason for seeking the meeting with Putin, saying: ""For me, there is no alternative to seeking direct talks with Russia as well, despite all the very great differences."" According to the United Nations, at least 1,892 civilians have been killed and 2,558 injured since the war in Ukraine started in February.",45,5.063075889940301,5.144836091448061,-0.08176020150775987,22
2022-04-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/hacking-industrial-facilities-energy-department/index.html,US officials warn of new hacking tools that could be used to target energy facilities,"US officials warned Wednesday that unnamed hackers have developed tools designed to ""gain full system access"" to the sensitive computer systems used to operate energy facilities. The tools could help a hacker burrow into an industrial computer network and ""disrupt critical devices or functions,"" said the Department of Energy, the FBI, the National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in an advisory. There are no reports of the malicious code being used in cyberattacks. But US officials and cybersecurity experts urged organizations to harden their defenses because the malicious software could be used to disrupt critical infrastructure if successfully deployed. The hacking tools could permit ""lower-skilled cyber actors to emulate higher-skilled actor capabilities,"" the US agencies said. The agencies did not identify who was responsible for developing the hacking tools or in what country they had been developed. CNN has requested comment from the agencies. Two US cybersecurity firms that analyzed the hacking tools, Dragos and Mandiant, said the malicious software was likely state-sponsored. Mandiant analysts called it ""an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability."" ""We are unable to associate (the hacking tools) with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest"" in industrial control systems, Mandiant analysts said. The tools pose ""the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" the analysts added. For years, multiple state-linked hacking groups, including some tied to Russia, China and Iran, have taken an interest in infiltrating industrial computer networks. Doing so generally takes specialized knowledge and skill that is different from hacking a business computer network. For their part, US and Israeli hackers were reportedly behind the 2009 cyber operation against an Iranian facility for nuclear energy. Ukrainian authorities on Tuesday accused a hacking group linked with Russian military intelligence of trying to sabotage an electric utility that served about 2 million people in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said the attack had been thwarted and had not affected the provision of electricity at the utility. The Justice Department has blamed the same Russian hacking group for causing power outages in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. Those cyberattacks are the only two hacks on record that have successfully caused power outages, according to analysts.",20,8.697617102881747,8.294705091210016,0.40291201167173085,2
2022-04-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/genocide-russia-invasion-ukraine-what-matters/index.html,Here's what 'genocide' means and why it's so hard to prove,"President Joe Biden said this week that the atrocities being uncovered in Ukraine as Russia continues its invasion qualify as ""genocide."" The declaration is not expected to trigger any immediate changes to American policy toward the conflict, US officials familiar with the matter told CNN, though Biden's comment marks a dramatic rhetorical escalation. ""We'll let the lawyers decide, internationally, whether or not it qualifies,"" the President said, ""but it sure seems that way to me."" So what exactly does ""genocide"" mean, and how is it proved? Here's what you need to know: What does genocide mean? The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which was adopted after World War II, defines genocide as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" including: Killing members of the group. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. But world leaders can designate any event as a genocide using any criteria they choose, according to Leila Sadat, a war crimes expert at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law. How many times has the US designated a genocide? The US has made only eight formal determinations of genocide, according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. American hesitance at calling atrocities ""genocide"" is rooted in the term's strict legal definition, which was written following the Holocaust in 1948. The UN Genocide Convention obligates countries to intervene once a genocide is determined to be underway, stating, ""Genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish."" How is genocide designated? Biden administration officials have cited the genocide designation in Myanmar, made only last month, as an example of a process used to generate the label. It took the United States amassing evidence over the course of years to come to the determination that Myanmar's persecution of the Rohingya minority constituted a genocide. Another option for world governments is to seek out prosecution for genocide through the International Criminal Court, though the process is lengthy and proving genocide can be tricky. ""The difference between crimes against humanity -- which is a horrific crime -- and the subset of crimes against humanity that we call 'genocide' is we have to show that essentially the perpetrators in this case wish to destroy in whole or in part the Ukrainian people,"" Sadat told CNN. ""And it's a very high bar,"" she continued. ""Whether it should be a high bar is another question."" How long does it take to prosecute genocide? A long time. The International Criminal Court and national courts ""have to identify specific individuals who they have reasonable grounds to believe actually perpetrated those crimes in their individual capacity,"" Sadat said. ""And so the criminal investigations will take much longer because you have to identify the perpetrators; you have to collect the evidence against them. And then ultimately you would bring criminal trials to try to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that in fact they did perpetrate the crime -- either war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide,"" she added. What is the difference between genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes? Genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are related but distinct labels, per Sadat: War crimes are breaches of the laws and customs of war. Crimes against humanity are defined as widespread or systemic attacks directed at civilians. Genocide is when crimes against humanity are carried out with the goal of eliminating a population. Sadat describes the three labels as the ""atrocity cascade."" ""Once we have an active aggression like this with an invasion of a sovereign country, typically the cascade begins with war crimes. Then we see the crimes against humanity, and we have pockets of genocidal killing within the crimes against humanity,"" she said. Could Vladimir Putin be indicted for genocide? Hypothetically, yes. The International Criminal Court tries four types of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes. Anyone accused of a crime in the court's jurisdiction can be tried. The court tries people, not countries, and it focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for genocide. However, the International Criminal Court does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia. How are world leaders reacting to Biden's comment? In Ukraine, Biden's remark was welcomed by President Volodymyr Zelensky, who tweeted praise for the comment almost immediately. ""True words of a true leader,"" he wrote. ""Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil. We are grateful for US assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities."" But at least one key US ally, French President Emmanuel Macron, has pushed back on the comment. ""I want to continue to try, as much as I can, to stop this war and rebuild peace. I am not sure that an escalation of rhetoric serves that cause,"" Macron said. ""What we can say for sure is that the situation is unacceptable and that these are war crimes. We are living through war crimes that are unprecedented on our soil -- our European soil.""",45,4.707248287328281,3.0779205566691616,1.6293277306591194,3
2022-04-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/ukraine-security-assistance-biden/index.html,Biden unveils $800 million security package for Ukraine in call with Zelensky,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the US was sending his nation an additional $800 million worth of weapons, ammunition and other security assistance. It comes as US officials warn of a potentially bloody new phase in the ongoing war, focused on the eastern regions of Ukraine as Russia withdraws its troops from the area around the capital Kyiv. ""The Ukrainian military has used the weapons we are providing to devastating effect. As Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region, the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself,"" Biden said in a statement. Biden detailed the new announcement in a midday telephone call with Zelensky that lasted for about an hour. ""Continued constant dialogue with @POTUS. Assessed Russian war crimes. Discussed additional package of defensive and possible macro-financial aid. Agreed to enhance sanctions,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. The US is providing Ukraine with 11 Mi-17 helicopters, 300 Switchblade drones, 18 Howitzers and protective equipment to guard against chemical attacks in the latest batch of security assistance approved by the White House, the Pentagon announced. In addition, the new weapons package includes 200 M113 armored personnel carriers, 10 counter-artillery radars, 500 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 30,000 sets of body armor and helmets. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the $800 million package was intended to ""meet urgent Ukrainian needs for today's fight"" as Russian forces shift the focus of their attack to eastern and southern Ukraine. He said the weapons would begin being sent to Ukraine ""as soon as possible,"" noting that previous security assistance had been sent in as little as four-to-five days after security packages were approved. As of Tuesday night, two sources said helicopters had been removed from the assistance list, though Biden said in his statement they were ultimately included. Ukraine had initially asked the White House at the last minute not to send the helicopters, indicating they wanted more time to assess whether they'd be useful. But during Wednesday's phone call, Zelensky told Biden his country needed them, so they were put back in the package, a source familiar with the matter said. The Mi-17 helicopters that were added to the package had been earmarked for Afghanistan, Kirby said. The $800 million shipment brings the total amount of military assistance the US has provided to Ukraine to more than $3 billion. Ukraine's 2020 defense budget was only about $6 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In less than two months, the US has provided nearly half of that in security assistance, underscoring the pace at which the White House has worked to send in weaponry and equipment. Delivery of earlier packages was still being completed as the new one was announced. The US expects a remaining number of the first 100 Switchblade drone systems to get into Ukraine ""over the course of the next day,"" according to a senior US defense official. The official also said that another shipment of Javelin anti-tank missiles from the US is expected to get to Ukraine in the next 24 hours. The US also has helped coordinate two airlift deliveries from two other nations into Ukraine, the official said during an off-camera briefing Wednesday. Switchblade drones are small, portable drones that carry warheads and detonate on impact. The smallest model can hit a target up to six miles away, according to the company that produces the drones. ""The steady supply of weapons the United States and its allies and partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its fight against the Russian invasion. It has helped ensure that Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine. We cannot rest now. As I assured President Zelenskyy, the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom,"" Biden wrote in a statement. The Pentagon was still working through how US forces will train Ukrainians on some of the new systems they are sending in the security assistance package. ""We're still working through what those options are going to look like, what that training's going to look like, how many US troops are going to be involved in it, where's it going to be, how long,"" Kirby said at a briefing with reporters. He said the US would be able to train the Ukrainians on the new systems ""very, very quickly,"" and would likely be done by training a small number of Ukrainian troops who could then train others, including on the Switchblade drones, some of which were sent in an earlier assistance package. The new tranche of money for Ukraine comes as the Pentagon hosted the CEOs of the military's eight largest prime contractors Wednesday to figure out how to arm Ukraine faster, according to a readout of the classified meeting. The roundtable discussion, led by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, focused on the Pentagon's objectives to keep supplying Ukraine with arms while being able to maintain the readiness of US forces and support the defense of allies. The Pentagon sought to better understand challenges defense contractors face in rapidly producing the arms and equipment that have proved critical to the defense of Ukraine, according to the readout. On Tuesday, a defense industry official had told CNN the major weapons manufacturers are facing severe supply chain issues and a lack of affordable labor. Manufacturing capacity could face additional challenges as Ukraine contracts compete with increased US defense spending for the current output, the official said. The classified roundtable Wednesday was meant in part to address those concerns in an ongoing series of discussions between the Pentagon and the largest weapons manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and General Dynamics. But it was primarily focused on the goal of ""accelerating production"" of weapons for Ukraine, including systems that can be shipped quickly and used effectively with minimal training. A senior defense official said Wednesday that the massive shipments of weapons to Ukraine have not affected the readiness of US forces. The official called it ""prudent"" to have the discussions ""before it becomes a crisis issue for our own readiness.""

""We want to prosecute these war criminals in our Ukrainian courts, named by Ukraine,"" Venediktova said, while acknowledging the role of the International Criminal Court. Her comments come as shocking atrocities in Ukraine, allegedly at the hands of Russian forces, have amplified calls to pursue war crimes charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin. After images of at least 20 bodies strewn across the street in Bucha, Ukraine, emerged earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for an end to Russian ""war crimes."" Russia has denied any involvement in the incident, claiming -- without evidence -- that the atrocities in Bucha were staged, and part of a ""planned media campaign."" But witnesses who have spoken to CNN said the carnage in the town began weeks ago, when it was occupied by Russian forces, and a video depicts Russian forces appearing to indiscriminately fire at a civilian. Venediktova said Monday that she has made multiple visits to Bucha, where the community is ""still exhuming the dead bodies from the mass grave."" ""It is not only war crimes. Now we can say -- a lot of crimes against humanity,"" she said. The scenes out of the Kyiv suburb have drawn international outrage, with Western leaders -- including President Joe Biden -- calling for war crimes investigations and fresh sanctions against Russia. The President said earlier this month that the images from Bucha warranted calling Putin a ""war criminal,"" adding, ""but we have to gather the information. We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight and we have to get all the details so this can be an actual -- have a war crime trial."" The top war crimes prosecutor for the International Criminal Court has traveled to Ukraine to investigate, and the US Embassy in Kyiv argued in the war's opening days that specific Russian attacks constituted war crimes.

2022-04-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/politics/biden-iowa-genocide/index.html,Biden calls atrocities in Ukraine a 'genocide' for the first time,"President Joe Biden said Tuesday the atrocities being uncovered in Ukraine qualify as genocide, a designation he'd previously avoided but that he now believes is warranted as scenes of devastation emerge from towns once overrun by Russian troops. ""I called it genocide because it's become clearer and clearer that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is just trying to wipe out even the idea of being Ukrainian. The evidence is mounting,"" Biden told reporters in Iowa after using the term earlier in a speech. ""It's different than it was last week, the more evidence that's coming out,"" he continued. ""Literally, the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine -- and we're going to only learn more and more about the devastation."" ""We'll let the lawyers decide, internationally, whether or not it qualifies,"" he concluded, ""but it sure seems that way to me."" It was a dramatic rhetorical escalation in the US view of what is happening on the ground in Ukraine, which Biden has previously deemed war crimes. And it appeared to be the latest example of the President allowing his emotion-driven views of the war to outpace official US policy toward the conflict, even as he was voicing a position held by many Americans horrified by the scenes of brutality in Ukraine. It garnered near-immediate praise from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who began accusing Russia of committing genocide inside his country last week. ""True words of a true leader @POTUS,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. ""Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil. We are grateful for US assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities."" The US government rarely designates atrocities using the term genocide; previous examples include the Chinese campaign against Uyghur Muslims and Myanmar's persecution of the Muslim minority Rohingya. It does not carry any legal ramifications but does carry significant weight as Biden seeks to rally countries behind a strategy of isolating and punishing Moscow. As recently as Sunday, Biden's top advisers had downplayed the importance of designating Russia's actions in Ukraine a genocide. And Biden himself said last week that a genocide was not underway. But since then, scenes of horror have emerged from Ukraine, including in the town of Bucha, where images of dead civilians and mass graves drew international outcry. In his remarks earlier Tuesday, Biden said Americans' budgets shouldn't depend on whether a dictator ""commits genocide"" in another country, an apparent reference to Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide a half a world away,"" Biden said in Iowa, where he was unveiling a new rule on ethanol. That was a different stance than a week ago. ""No, I think it is a war crime,"" he said April 4 when questioned whether atrocities revealed in Bucha, Ukraine, would constitute a genocide. While decrying war crimes and atrocities, he and his aides have said the actions seen in Ukraine don't rise to the ""genocide"" level. ""We have seen atrocities, we have seen war crimes. We have not yet seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier this month. Administration officials have cited the genocide designation in Myanmar, made only last month, as an example of a process used to generate the label. It took the United States amassing evidence over the course of years to come to the determination that a genocide was underway. ""We will look to a series of indicators along those lines to ultimately make a determination in Ukraine,"" Sullivan said. On Sunday, Sullivan told CNN's Jake Tapper that calling it ""genocide"" isn't as important as calling out the atrocities. ""In my opinion, the label is less important than the fact that these acts are cruel and criminal and wrong and evil, and need to be responded to decisively,"" he said. Biden has previously offered views of the situation in Ukraine they go beyond what his administration has officially declared. He said in mid-March that Putin was a ""war criminal,"" a view his press secretary later said was a description ""from the heart."" The administration officially said war crimes were underway a few weeks later. It's another moment of Biden getting ahead of his administration's official stance. Visiting Warsaw later in March, Biden said in a speech that Putin ""cannot remain in power."" Later, he said he was speaking after an emotional visit with refugees, and the United States wasn't pursuing a policy of regime change in Russia.

2022-04-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/politics/us-ukraine-security-assistance/index.html,US expected to announce hundreds of millions in new security assistance to Ukraine,"The US is expected to announce on Wednesday it is sending hundreds of millions of dollars in new military assistance to Ukraine, three sources familiar with the package tell CNN. The final amount had not been finalized as of Tuesday but is expected to be close to $700 million. President Joe Biden is expected to use his drawdown authority to authorize the new aid package for Ukraine. Reuters first reported on the new security assistance package. If approved, the addition of approximately $700 million in security assistance would bring the total aid to Ukraine to more than $3 billion since the start of the Biden administration, including nearly $2.5 billion since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's 2020 defense budget was only about $6 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In less than two months, the US has provided nearly half of that in security assistance, underscoring the pace at which the White House has worked to send in weaponry and equipment. US shipments of an $800 million security assistance package approved in mid-March will likely wrap up by the middle of April, a senior defense official said Tuesday. And a $100 million package of Javelin anti-armor systems approved in early April will also likely complete delivery very soon, the official added. These packages came from Defense Department inventories, making it relatively easy and quick to transfer the weapons and systems to Ukraine. According to a draft list of the shipment described to CNN that had been sent to Congress, the administration was considering the delivery of weapons systems to Ukraine that would include MI-17 helicopters, coastal sea drones, howitzers, armored humvees and other weapons that had been in previous aid packages. As of Tuesday night, two sources said helicopters had been removed from the list, which officials say is heavily caveated, with items regularly changed or removed up until it receives the final authorization and signature from Biden. On April 1, the White House also authorized a separate $300 million in security assistance to Ukraine, but this package will take more time, since it has to be procured from defense contractors first. Pentagon to hold meeting with arms manufacturers The new tranche of money for Ukraine comes as the Pentagon is set to convene a meeting of its top weapons makers Wednesday to discuss the industry's capacity to support Ukraine in a protracted war with Russia, according to a defense official and an industry official. The classified discussion will include proposals to speed up the production of existing systems and develop new systems critical to the Defense Department's assistance to Ukraine and to allies, the defense official said. The meeting will bring together the top eight prime defense contractors, such as General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and others. It is ""part of our ongoing, frequent dialogue with industry partners to ensure a resilient industrial base that is responsive to the Department's needs,"" the official said. The meeting between the defense contractors and the Pentagon was organized just a few days ago, according to the defense industry official with direct knowledge of the arrangements. The official said the contractors have been told the focus of the meeting is on the ""capacity of the industry"" to support Ukraine if the war goes on for several years. The sense of things, the official said, is the US is ""assuming this is going to be a years-long endeavor"" in a scenario where, at a minimum, Ukraine will not able to safely manufacture weapons in its own country. But in the meeting, the official said, the contractors are likely to bring up the serious challenges still facing defense manufacturing in the US, including ongoing and severe supply chain issues and a lack of affordable labor. All of this continues to constrict defense manufacturing capacity and could grow worse as increased defense spending in the budget and Ukraine contracts vie for manufacturing capacity, the official said. The issue of capacity is also impacting the manufacture of critical ammunition supplies, even though most of it is done in government-owned, contractor-operated facilities.

2022-04-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/11/europe/ukraine-donbas-battle-russia-cmd-intl/index.html,Russia has appointed a new general for Ukraine. Can Moscow reboot its war in time for Putin to claim a victory?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has a new general overseeing his war in Ukraine, and his military commanders are signaling a new phase in the war: an all-out effort to take and hold the portions of Ukraine's Donbas region still under Ukrainian control. Ukrainians seem to be taking that threat at face value. In the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, local officials have been urging many communities to evacuate, opening up humanitarian corridors for civilians to leave for safer parts of Ukraine. In northeastern Kharkiv region, authorities are evacuating the towns of Barvinkove and Lozova. In Dnipro, a regional capital in east-central Ukraine, the mayor, Borys Filatov, has requested that women, children and the elderly leave. ""The situation is gradually heating up in Donbas, and we understand that April will be quite hot,"" Filatov said recently. ""Therefore, a huge request: Everyone who has the opportunity (as I have said repeatedly) to leave -- first of all, this applies to women, children, and older people who are not involved in the work of critical infrastructure."" Can Russia mount a terrifying new offensive in the east? The latest satellite images collected and analyzed by Maxar Technologies show an 8-mile-long Russian military convoy making its south through the eastern Ukraine town of Velkyi Burluk, to the east of the city of Kharkiv. In remarks on national television Saturday, Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Interior Minister, said Kharkiv was ""being shelled practically all day long"" and that a Russian offensive was expected in the Kharkiv region, from the direction of Izium. Military experts and western officials have also speculated that Putin's generals are feeling the pressure to deliver some sort of results ahead of May 9, when Russia marks Victory Day, the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. But a fresh analysis from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based think tank, casts some doubt on Russia's ability to concentrate the forces needed to make a breakthrough in the Donbas. ""We assess that the Russian military will struggle to amass a large and combat-capable force of mechanized units to operate in Donbas within the next few months,"" the analysis states. ""Russia will likely continue to throw badly damaged and partially reconstituted units piecemeal into offensive operations that make limited gains at great cost."" Military analysts and observers say Russia may struggle to reorganize forces that have been battered by the Ukrainian military, particularly in the defense of Kyiv and northern Ukraine. Before the invasion, Russia had arrayed approximately 120 battalion tactical groups around Ukraine. According to one European official, about a quarter of those forces are ""effectively inoperable"" after heavy casualties and the destruction of hardware. A US defense official on April 8 gave a slightly different estimate, saying Russian forces were now ""below 85 percent of their assessed available combat power"" assembled ahead of the February 24 invasion. Those US defense estimates, ISW said, ""unintentionally exaggerate the Russian military's current capabilities to fight."" According to ISW, ""the dozens of Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) that retreated from around Kyiv likely possess combat power that is a fraction of what the numbers of units or total numbers of personnel with those units would suggest. Russian units that have fought in Ukraine have taken fearful damage."" A commander with a track record of brutality Army General Alexander Dvornikov, the commander of Russia's Southern Military District, has been named as theater commander of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, according to a US official and a European official. Dvornikov, 60, was the first commander of Russia's military operations in Syria, after Putin sent troops there in September 2015 to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. During Dvornikov's command in Syria from September 2015 to June 2016, Russian aircraft backed the Assad regime and its allies as they laid siege to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, bombarding densely populated neighborhoods and causing major civilian casualties. The city fell to Syrian government forces in December 2016. From 2000 to 2003 Dvornikov served in Russia's lengthy pacification campaign in the north Caucasus, including the Second Chechen War, which left the regional capital of Chechnya, Grozny, in ruins. Russian forces have used a similarly heavy-handed approach in parts of Ukraine, striking residential buildings in major cities and demolishing much of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Dvornikov was awarded the title of ""Hero the Russian Federation"" by the Kremlin in March 2016 for his services. The appointment of a new overall commander to lead Russia's war in Ukraine appears to be an effort to remedy another problem that has hampered Russian forces: lack of coordination. ""The Russians are apparently attempting to resolve one of the problems from which their initial invasion suffered by making Southern Military District Commander General Alexander Dvornikov the single overall commander of operations in Ukraine,"" ISW stated. ""This simplification of the Russian command structure may not resolve all of Russia's command problems, however... Russian forces will likely continue to struggle to establish coherent and efficient command and control arrangements for the foreseeable future."" That doesn't mean the coming weeks will be easy for Ukrainian forces fighting in the east. ISW said Russia's military ""likely will make gains nevertheless and may either trap or wear down Ukrainian forces enough to secure much of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, but it is at least equally likely that these Russian offensives will culminate before reaching their objectives, as similar Russian operations have done."" In remarks Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine was prepared for intense fighting. ""Ukraine is ready for big battles,"" said Podolyak. ""Ukraine must win them, particularly in Donbas. And after that, Ukraine will get a more powerful negotiating position, from which it can dictate certain conditions. After that, the presidents [of Ukraine and Russia] will meet. That may take two or three weeks."" The next weeks may prove if that is an overly optimistic scenario. But it presents what appears to be a negotiating position, as much as a military assessment: Putin can talk now, or risk being significantly weaker later.",7,6.7299906146954855,5.718030200231003,1.0119604144644825,13

A total of 10 minibus drivers had driven into the Donbas region to help evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol, operating private vehicles in a low-profile rescue mission. Russian soldiers stopped them and tried to get them to drive the buses into Russia. When the drivers refused, they were taken prisoner, said Alex Voronin, the head of the non-government organization. Voronin told CNN he had lost contact with all the drivers but one. ""All of them carried out the evacuation of people in the direction of Mariupol-Zaporizhzhia, they were sent on their trips on different dates - March 26, 27 and 31,"" Voronin told CNN. ""Communication with them broke off the next day after departure. According to the people they managed to evacuate, the Russian military took the vehicles with people in Mariupol from the drivers, the evacuees were taken to the village of Nikolske, the drivers themselves were taken away for identification. Some of them are being held in pre-trial detention centers in Donetsk."" One of the 10 drivers was released, Voronin told CNN, and from him ""we know that three of the missing are in Donetsk. They were interrogated with brute force, fed poorly and kept in appalling conditions. All the rest were told they have the right to keep [in detention] up to 30 days."" CNN cannot independently verify the whereabouts of the drivers or the conditions under which they are being held. Voronin said drivers left the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia and did not drive in a single convoy. The city of Mariupol has been devastated by weeks of shelling and is ringed by Russian checkpoints. On Monday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed South Korean lawmakers, saying he believes there are tens of thousands dead in the southern port city. ""The occupiers blocked it and did not even allow food and water to be brought there. They tried to capture it in the most brutal way - just to destroy everything in the city,"" he said. Ukrainian officials have said around 100,000 people still require evacuation from the city but say Russian forces have not allowed convoys of evacuation buses to reach the city. Adding to the humanitarian crisis, US and Ukrainian officials and humanitarian watchdogs say Russian and separatist troops are forcing tens of thousands of civilians into so-called ""filtration centers"" in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic before moving them into Russian territory. Voronin's group was formed at the beginning of the war, on February 24, in Ukraine, to help evacuate Ukrainians. He says his group -- one of many that sprang up in the days since the Russian invasion -- has ""evacuated more than 2,000 people, children, the disabled and the wounded, and delivered more than 200 tons of food, humanitarian aid and medicine to the same locations where we are evacuating people."" Voronin says he does not even know who on the Russian side he can talk to in order to secure the release of his drivers. CNN has not been able to verify the whereabouts of the drivers amid the fog of war and confusion in the frontlines and is reporting this at the request of the aid group in the hopes that bringing attention to the story will bring protection of some sort to the missing drivers. CNN has requested comment from Ukrainian officials overseeing the negotiation of humanitarian evacuation corridors in Ukraine.",47,4.7645230041288285,4.902457392604701,-0.13793438847587236,24
2022-04-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/11/politics/us-russia-election-interference/index.html,US assesses Putin may increase efforts to interfere with US elections,"The United States believes Russian President Vladimir Putin may be willing to take more aggressive action against the US, including dialing up his attempts to interfere with American elections in response to its support for Ukraine, according to four sources familiar with recent US intelligence assessments. That could include direct attacks on US election infrastructure, among a broad range of options, the sources said. There is no evidence that Putin has made a decision to interfere in upcoming elections or that he has preferred candidates, the sources said. Attempted hacks on voting infrastructure would also not be easy, because voting systems in the US are so diffuse and decentralized. But whereas previously Putin was less willing to try to directly interfere in states' voting systems -- opting instead to order scans of voter registration databases and conduct influence campaigns to sow doubt in the legitimacy of elections -- intelligence officials believe Putin may now be willing to go further than in previous interference efforts. ""As we apply pressure and as Ukraine applies pressure, he's certainly going to expand the options he would consider,"" said one source briefed on the intelligence community's assessments. ""So what might he do? I don't think there was any real conclusion to that. Just a consideration of a broad range of things."" Another source familiar with the intelligence said that one of the options could be ""directly attacking election infrastructure,"" reflecting ""a change in Putin's risk tolerance, as we have seen with his invasion of Ukraine."" A US official made clear the assessments were not based on direct intelligence. ""We do not have any direct intelligence that Russia is looking to target state, local, or election systems more directly than before, but we are certainly anticipating the possibility. We will continue to actively share any intelligence about increased threats with state and local officials as we receive it,"" the official told CNN. Putin more willing to take risks The intelligence community has made understanding Putin's mindset a priority since early in the invasion, sources familiar with internal deliberations told CNN. Raw assessments have pointed to his increasingly unpredictable behavior, and US officials believe Putin is more willing to consider taking risks due to his anger over Russia's failures in Ukraine -- something his advisers, who officials say have not been telling him the full truth, did not prepare him for. The Associated Press reported on Saturday that Putin may use US support for Ukraine as a pretext to interfere in US elections. Lawmakers were briefed by intelligence officials last week on Putin's calculus on potential influence operations, according to another US official familiar with the briefing. The briefing acknowledged that, should Putin shift his focus to inflicting harm outside of Ukraine, US midterm elections this year present one possible target for Russian operatives, according to the US official. Russian actors also attempted to influence the 2016 and 2020 elections. The briefing did not suggest there was specific intelligence saying that the Kremlin would target US elections, according to the official, but rather that elections are one of multiple areas that the Russian government could target for influence operations in response to the war in Ukraine. ""If Putin feels backed into a corner he may turn his cyber forces in any number of directions,"" the US official said, adding that officials are on heightened alert given US midterm elections this year. While it would be difficult for Russia to tamper with voter tallies, another source noted that Russia would not need to change many, if any, votes ""to throw the security of the entire voting enterprise into question."" Even if Russian hacking efforts did not affect the outcome at all, sowing chaos and distrust in the voting systems could be enough of a victory, another source said. When asked about the assessments, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. ""Our Election Threats Executive continues to lead the Intelligence Community's efforts against foreign threats to US elections,"" ODNI spokesman Nicole de Haay said in a statement to CNN. Elections are not the only target Russia could have in mind. The US government has begun warning about the possibility that Russia could try to attack US critical infrastructure, urging private sector owners and operators to be prepared. ""All businesses, all critical infrastructure owners and operators need to assume that disruptive cyber activity is something that the Russians are thinking about, that are preparing for, that are exploring options, as the President said,"" Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CNN late last month.",20,5.52755706650696,4.961649425824216,0.5659076406827435,0

Liz Cheney of Wyoming on Sunday said Russia's missile strike on an eastern Ukraine railway station last week that killed dozens of civilians ""clearly is genocide."" ""I think that Europe needs to understand and grapple with the fact that you've got a genocidal campaign, the first kind of horrific genocidal campaign that we have seen, certainly in recent decades,"" she told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" Cheney added that European countries need to ""understand that they're funding that genocidal campaign"" through the purchase of oil and gas from Russia, and should place an embargo on Russian oil and gas. At least 50 people, including five children, were killed and nearly 100 more were wounded on Friday from a Russian missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk where they were waiting to evacuate, Ukrainian officials said Friday. World leaders condemned the attack and the US State Department called it ""yet another example of the Russian government's unjustified brutal war sowing senseless death and destruction in Ukraine."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russian forces of committing genocide in his country, pointing to the bombing of a maternity and children's hospital and apparent brutal executions of civilians in Bucha, Ukraine. The Biden administration has accused Russia of war crimes and is supporting investigations into Russia's actions in Ukraine by helping document atrocities, but has stopped short of calling the killings a ""genocide."" The United Nations defines genocide as ""acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" including ""killing members of the group,"" ""causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group,"" and ""deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part."" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday downplayed the significance of ""the label"" of genocide in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""In my opinion, the label is less important than the fact that these acts are cruel and criminal and wrong and evil, and need to be responded to decisively, and that is what we are doing,"" Sullivan said when pressed by Tapper on the Russian killing of civilians in Ukraine. In a separate interview with ABC's ""This Week,"" Sullivan said the administration views the attribution as a legal distinction. ""That is a determination that we work through systematically,"" he said. ""There is a unit at the State Department that gathers evidence and then makes a legal analysis, because genocide is actually a legal determination."" Appearing on ""State of the Union,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told CNN that ""it is clear that Putin is systematically targeting civilians,"" saying that's why Canada has supported an International Criminal Court investigation into war crimes. Asked by Tapper if Russia's actions in Ukraine constitutes genocide, Trudeau said, ""Those are the things that will be determined."" ""Obviously, the messages we're seeing, the stories of what Russian soldiers are doing, not just the murder of civilians, but the systematic use of sexual violence and rape, to destabilize and have the greatest negative impact on Ukrainian people as possible is absolutely unforgivable and unacceptable,"" he added.",45,5.19806274755449,4.9036298018106415,0.29443294574384815,3
2022-04-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/10/world/police-departments-send-equipment-to-ukraine/index.html,US police agencies are sending protective gear to Ukrainian civilians in what experts call an unprecedented move,"The governors of Iowa and Nebraska announced last week interagency initiatives to donate police protective gear, including military-grade equipment such as helmets and vests, to Ukraine to help civilians defend themselves against Russia's invasion. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts said his state will send 550 pieces of protective gear and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said her state's department of public safety and 18 law enforcement agencies will provide Ukraine with 860 pieces of gear. The agencies join a growing list of police departments -- from California to Ohio to Vermont -- that are donating non-lethal police gear to aid Ukrainian civilians, according to a CNN review of state-by-state efforts and interviews with some of those involved. Among the agencies contacted by CNN, and the non-government groups gathering supplies, none have said they're collecting weapons or ammunition. Many of the police departments involved in these efforts are working with charity organizations and former members of the US military. Some sources with direct knowledge of the varied efforts -- but who are not involved -- spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity due to concerns about potential legal questions the effort could raise. It's unprecedented, experts say, for US law enforcement agencies to donate police protective equipment and military-grade gear to a foreign country involved in an ongoing war. The effort also raises questions about the roles of police departments and whether, as domestic law enforcement agencies, they should send equipment to a foreign conflict outside of their jurisdiction. Because there's no central coordinating group, there's not an easy way to say what's being shipped or whether it's subject to export regulations. The Ukrainian American Coordinating Council (UACC), a non-profit organization, is at the center of one effort to send regulated, military-grade and police protective items to Ukraine, including ballistic helmets, hard plates, soft armor inserts and vests, the group says. When Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, the UACC moved quickly to obtain a license from the Department of Commerce to export level III ballistic vests and helmets, as well as a special authorization from the State Department for level IV vests in a limited capacity, according to the organization. Level III armor is the first level of body armor that provides protection against rifle rounds and level IV is rated by the National Institute of Justice as the highest level of ballistic protection. In accordance with the UACC's export license, the equipment can only be provided to Ukrainian civilians who have joined territorial defense units to defend their country against Russian troops, according to Mick Safron, an executive member of the board of UACC. The UACC is partnering with the Ukrainian charitable organization called Come Back Alive, which helps store and distribute the equipment from Lviv warehouses to territorial defenses and ""hotspots"" across the country, according to the UACC. The foundation has end-user certificates for every territorial defense unit that receives vest and helmet donations, according to Safron. The UACC acknowledges where Come Back Alive is distributing the donations. However, once the shipments arrive in the country, the UACC does not have control over whether the gear is distributed to the Ukrainian army or police forces, Safron said. The US Department of Commerce and State Department did not confirm the UACC's claims regarding its export license and special authorization, but the State Department tells CNN that groups seeking to donate military-grade gear and other equipment may be subject to export regulations. A spokesperson for the Department of Commerce told CNN in a statement that it does not ""comment on specific license applications or parties, including whether a party has filed a license application."" The department ""has been processing requests for exports to authorized end-users in Ukraine rapidly,"" according to the statement, which includes applications for licenses to export firearms and ammunition under its ""existing processes and authorities."" In an interview with CNN, retired US Army Maj. Gen. Mike Repass -- the former commander of the US Special Operations Command in Europe -- said level IV body armor is ""capable of withstanding one or two shots from a Soviet-type round"" and the technology is controlled by the State Department for US export. ""However, the provision of Level IV body armor is subject to a lengthy process to get US approval for delivery to Ukraine. It is late-to-need as a result,"" Repass added. Some of the gear being donated by law enforcement departments, including certain types of protective vests, do not qualify as military-grade, meaning they can be sent to Ukraine without approval from the federal government, according to US Army veteran Alex Plitsas, who has been working with several police departments across Connecticut to ship the equipment to Ukraine. A typical vest worn by a police officer, rated to stop most handgun rounds, would not qualify as military-grade. The State Department is advising groups involved in the donations to consult with the Ukrainian government, ""to confirm the items will meet an immediate requirement,"" a department spokesperson told CNN. ""After that, items must first be assessed to determine how they are controlled for purposes of export ... prospective donors must follow necessary export licensing rules before sending."" Organizers and police departments involved in this effort tell CNN that their work is legal, and the equipment being donated is reviewed to ensure it meets federal export regulations. But it remains unclear whether federal agencies are fully aware of every item that is being shipped to Ukraine as the US government largely puts the onus on donors to ensure they are following the law. CNN spoke with several experts about the legality of various efforts to aid Ukraine by sending protective gear and raised the central question of whether the federal government should be authorizing local police departments to intervene in international affairs. ""The answer is, probably not,"" said Martin L. Cook, a professor of professional military ethics who taught at US war colleges. ""What gives them the authority to do that? The short answer is nothing,"" Cook added. ""But do we have a mechanism? I don't think we do -- to say before a local police department can do such a thing, they have to clear with DOD or state."" According to Valerie Morkevičius, an associate professor of political science at Colgate University, there might be ""really strong and valid ethical reasons for wanting to engage in this type of support."" Morkevičius emphasized that, generally, people might be more sympathetic to Ukraine due to the circumstances of the war, and their sympathy ""might not be misplaced."" ""But we have to think about the broader implications that follow from all this,"" she added. ""If we want to say it's OK this time, what are the guideposts we might be shifting for future actions?"" US police agencies partnering with Ukrainian groups When Russia began its military invasion of Ukraine in late February, Pennsylvania police officer Dean Stecklair of Falls Township was approached by his mother-in-law for help. Stecklair's wife, who is Ukranian-Lithuanian, had family members stuck in the country and shared stories of civilians who were taking up arms to defend themselves against Russian attacks. She expressed the need for defensive equipment. His mother-in-law asked if the Falls Township police department had any tactical gear such as protective vests and helmets that were not being used to send overseas to Ukraine, he told CNN. Since then, the agency -- located in Bucks County, which houses a large Ukranian population -- has collected and donated more than 100 ballistic vests and dozens of helmets as part of its ""Operation Urgent Aid"" effort and has collaborated with departments in nearby counties to set up drop-off points for donations to send to Ukraine. It's just one of the many ways that US law enforcement agencies across the country are joining the loosely organized effort at the local and state level. Police departments in Colorado, Connecticut, Vermont, California, New York and Pennsylvania have all announced initiatives to procure and donate protective equipment. State and police agencies are working with Ukrainian-American groups in the United States and the Ukrainian government, according to Plitsas, the US Army veteran. US agencies, including the State Department, are aware of the ongoing effort involving police departments, he added. ""I believe that we have tapped into something larger than just our desire to help as police officers,"" Falls Township Police Chief Nelson Whitney told CNN. ""The community, regular citizens of the United States, have come out in large numbers to donate supplies,"" Whitney said. ""This desire to help innocent people who are being killed and injured by an aggressive totalitarian leader like Vladimir Putin is rooted deeply within the American spirit. How could we not help?"" In California, the state's Office of Emergency Services (OES) is working with the National Guard to coordinate donations from state and local law enforcement agencies for ""excess/re-sourced ballistic helmets, vests and gloves, as well as safety goggles to provide to Ukrainian citizens in and around the war zone,"" according to Brian Ferguson, a spokesperson for California OES. California OES and National Guard have been in ""regular communication"" with the Ukrainian consular affairs staff on potential humanitarian support, Ferguson said. The Fairfield Police Department and other agencies in Connecticut, such as Greenwich and Westport, have also collaborated in a joint effort to donate more than 200 previously used ballistic vests and helmets to assist Ukrainian soldiers, the department has announced. In a letter to the Fairfield Police Department, the Consul General of Ukraine located in Houston specified that ""body armor, helmets and other personal protective equipment"" was needed for military, police forces, and more than 100,000 civilians that joined ""Territorial Defense Forces"" since war broke out. That department is among the agencies engaged in this effort. Colorado's state government set five locations for police agencies to drop off excess equipment, including in Denver and Colorado Springs. More than 1,000 helmets and 840 sets of body armor were gathered this way from 25 different police agencies. Police officials in Colorado are increasingly taking interest in",20,6.3530233380154595,5.458542510843729,0.8944808271717308,29

Geolocation of a video posted to Twitter shows the body on the street. News photos taken on the ground later show painted red nails on the dead woman's hand and a heart shape on her ring finger. A makeup artist posted photos to Instagram of Iryna Filkina, 53, with the heart on her fingernail. Filkina had enrolled in the makeup artist's class before Russia invaded. Filkina's daughters, who fled to Poland, recognized their mother's hand in the photos that spread across the internet. When Russia invaded, Filkina stayed behind, helping people in Bucha and cooked for the Ukrainian military, according to her daughter. She got the red manicure for Valentine's Day and drew ""a heart on her finger because she started to love herself,"" her daughter Subacheva told CNN. CNN's Tara John, Oleksandra Ochman, Eoin McSweeney and Gianluca Mezzofiore put the pieces together in a remarkable report. Read it. Germans also gathering evidence The evidence of war crimes is coming not just from drones and social media, but also from intelligence. RELATED: Drone video team turns the tables on hiding Russian vehicle This is from a CNN report on German intelligence about intercepted Russian radio communications: Der Spiegel reported that the BND, Germany's foreign intelligence agency, intercepted Russian radio chatter about the killing of civilians in Bucha, and that some of the conversations could be tied directly to specific killings in Bucha that have been documented since news first emerged of an apparent massacre there. German intelligence has satellite images that point to the involvement of Russian troops in the Bucha killings, the Washington Post reported, citing an unnamed intelligence official, though the paper said the radio transmissions have not been linked to that location. Russia's disinformation campaign continues Russia is also apparently trying to tell its own story by hacking into the social media accounts of Ukrainian soldiers, according to Facebook parent company Meta. From CNN's report: The tactics the groups are using, according to Meta, include posing as journalists and independent news outlets online to push Russian talking points, attempting to hack dozens of Ukrainian soldiers' Facebook accounts, and running coordinated campaigns to try to get posts by critics of Russia removed from social media. Meta said a hacking group known as ""Ghostwriter,"" which cyber experts believe is linked to Belarus, attempted to hack into the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukrainian military personnel. Reporting on atrocities Meanwhile, photos and reporting from on the ground in Ukraine are documenting what is actually happening. Julia Kochetova is a Ukrainian photographer who has stayed to cover the war. She told CNN's Jim Sciutto and Poppy Harlow from Kyiv Thursday about how she separates the important mission of documenting atrocities from the pain of witnessing them. ""As a Ukrainian, as a citizen, as a photojournalist, I'm continuing to do my job. But I also had a strong feeling that it's not enough just to witness what's happening, what the crime against humanity is happening with my country, but also to document that crime."" It is important, she said, that Ukrainian journalists are bringing these images to the world. ""I still have a strong belief we need to highlight local voices because Ukrainian photographers on the ground, they have the real perspective, real balance and real truth. Because we know not only the context, not only the language -- that's our war; that's our country."" Russia rebuked by the UN Perceptions of reality are incredibly important in this war. Ukraine and Western countries have effectively marshaled most of the world against Russia by showing the invasion to be unjust, illegal and built on lies about Ukraine. The United Nations voted Thursday to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. ""The General Assembly has sent a crystal-clear message to Russia's leadership that a government whose military is routinely committing horrific rights violations has no business on the UN Human Rights Council,"" said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch, with a call for the UN and International Criminal Court to gather evidence and hold war crimes trials. ""Gruesome images from Bucha have shocked people around the world. Victims and their families deserve to see those responsible held to account."" Groundwork for war crimes trial Charbonneau's comments brought to mind the issue of war crimes and how they can be prosecuted. This conflict will be different in that it has been so meticulously documented. That drone and satellite images can immediately refute Russian claims about when bodies were left on the streets in Bucha is a remarkable thing. Organizations like Bellingcat, the Netherlands-based investigative journalism group, are using satellite and social media to document war crimes and identify their perpetrators. A former ICC prosecutor, James Goldston, who is now with the Open Society Justice Initiative, recently told me for an earlier newsletter that war crimes trials will be built like any other criminal case -- from the bottom up -- and will rely on documentation. ""Often international criminal investigations begin with the 'crime base' -- authenticated images, witness testimonies and other evidence concerning killings, torture, rape or other prohibited offenses which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity -- and proceed upward along a chain of military or political authority to demonstrate the culpability of those who ordered, or who knew of but failed to prevent/punish, the commission of such crimes,"" Goldston said. Perhaps the hyperconnectivity of the world we live in will help lead to some accountability for those threatening the world we live in.",45,3.9798333790994462,6.835425216159276,-2.85559183705983,3
2022-04-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/07/politics/air-force-hypersonic-missile-program-delay/index.html,Air Force delays hypersonic missile program after flight test 'anomalies',"The Air Force delayed its hypersonic missile program by up to a year after ""recent flight test anomalies"" pushed back the schedule for the weapon's completion, according to a statement from the Air Force. The AGM-183 Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) was supposed to reach early operational capability, an important milestone in weapon testing and development, before October. But following a series of failures in flight tests last year, the Air Force postponed the first test of the complete missile and booster to sometime in the next fiscal year, which begins in October. More tests will follow later in the year, the Air Force said. ""The ARRW production decision remains event-driven and will occur after operational utility is demonstrated through successful system end-to-end flight tests,"" the Air Force said. The military branches are developing different hypersonic systems as they examine various capabilities and needs. The Navy is developing its Conventional Prompt Strike system, which shares a hypersonic glide vehicle with the Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon. The Air Force is testing both ARRW and the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, while working with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) system. DARPA also has other hypersonic systems it is developing. CNN reported earlier this week that the US had successfully tested a HAWC missile but kept quiet about the test so as not to exacerbate tensions with Russia. The test came days after Russia said it used its own hypersonic Kinzhal missile during its invasion of Ukraine. The ARRW missile, built by Lockheed Martin, is designed to destroy ""high-value, time-sensitive targets,"" according to the Air Force. It is also supposed to enable the military to quickly strike a well-defended target on land. The delay in the program, first reported by Bloomberg, comes as lawmakers have voiced growing frustration about the US falling behind adversaries like China and Russia in hypersonic weapons development. At a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama warned that China has ""more troops, more ships and more hypersonic missiles than the United States,"" while Republican Rep. Michael Turner of Ohio said the defense industrial base needs to ""speed it up"" on hypersonic development. While some programs like HAWC have had successful tests, others like ARRW have repeatedly run into problems in testing, causing delays in the development of these complex, technically challenging systems. The HAWC and ARRW missiles are similar technologies -- air-launched, air-breathing hypersonic weapons -- but the Air Force's priority has been the ARRW, which has received a far larger budget with the goal of a deployable prototype in the coming fiscal year. But the delay will force the Air Force to devote more of its research and development budget to ARRW to complete flight testing as the schedule remains in question. ""This funding realignment allows the Air Force to revisit a procurement decision in FY24 once specific programmatic milestones have been achieved,"" the Air Force said. In the FY23 defense budget, the Biden administration has requested $7.2 billion for long range fires, including hypersonic missiles. In a report last year, the Government Accountability Office identified 70 efforts related to hypersonic weapons, expected to cost nearly $15 billion between 2015 and 2024.

2022-04-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/07/politics/us-intel-ukraine-donbas-operations/index.html,"US giving intel to Ukraine for operations in Donbas, Defense Secretary says","Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said publicly for the first time Thursday that the US is providing intelligence to Ukrainian forces to conduct operations in the Donbas region. Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Austin was asked whether the US was providing intelligence to help Ukraine carry out attacks against Russian forces in the separatist-controlled Donbas region or Crimea. ""We are providing them intelligence to conduct operations in the Donbas, that's correct,"" Austin said in response to the question from Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Austin did not mention Crimea in his response. He also stated the US is not discouraging Ukraine from launching attacks against Russian forces in these areas. Austin's comments were the first time a US official has publicly acknowledged the US role in Ukraine's operations in the contested region as the fighting shifts away from the capital of Kyiv and toward southeast Ukraine. A senior defense official told CNN that some of the intelligence provided to Ukraine is ""near real time."" ""We continue to provide useful information and intelligence to the Ukrainian Armed Forces in their fight,"" the defense official said after Austin's remarks. ""As that fight migrates more to the Donbas region, we will adjust our information content and flow as required."" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley, who testified earlier this week that the risk of ""significant international conflict"" was increasing, said Thursday that Russia's war with Ukraine was likely to become a ""long slog"" as Ukraine defends its territory. ""They've managed to defeat the Russian onslaught on to Kyiv, but there is a significant battle yet ahead down in the southeast, down around the Donbas Donetsk region where the Russians intend to get mass forces and continue their assault,"" Milley said. In the meantime, both Austin and Milley told the senators the Pentagon was taking whatever steps it could to help Ukraine's fight against Russia. US security assistance is flowing into Ukraine ""faster than most people would have ever believed conceivable,"" Austin told the committee on Thursday -- at times arriving in Ukraine within days of receiving authorization, he said. ""From the time authorization is provided, four or five days later we see real capability begin to show up,"" Austin said during the hearing on the Defense Department budget request. Keeping weapons flowing into Ukraine Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, pressed Austin on why all of $3 billion in congressional authorization for US arms to Ukraine has yet to be provided. ""We've only used $900 million of this -- less than a third of the amount authorized. Why hasn't the administration provided the full $3 billion?"" Austin told Wicker that the US has provided Ukraine with ""those capabilities that are relevant and effective in this fight."" ""You've seen us provide a tremendous amount of anti-armor, anti-aircraft capability and also communications capabilities, as well as UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). And we're also looking to help them in a number of other ways,"" he said. Milley testified that US and NATO countries have provided roughly 60,000 anti-tank weapons and 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine. He said that the US is looking at how it can provide Ukraine with additional armor and artillery as the war drags on, but said that it was key to find systems that Ukrainian forces would not need to be trained on, noting many US weapons systems would require months of training. ""The Russian air force has not even today established air superiority let alone air supremacy, which is one of the reasons why they are having great difficulty on the ground,"" Milley said. ""So the air superiority mission has not been achieved, why is that? It's because of the survival of the air defense systems, both the MANPADS (man-portable air defense systems) that we have been providing -- stingers and the like from other NATO countries -- plus the longer range SAMs (surface-to-air missiles) that have been provided and that they already had."" Updated guidance on intel sharing Under questioning from Cotton, Austin told the committee that the Pentagon would be sending ""updated guidance"" on Thursday regarding intelligence sharing, but he did not explicitly say what the guidance would entail. Cotton asked if the current guidance is not to provide such intelligence to Ukraine. ""Certainly, the current guidance was not clear in that regard, so we'll make sure it's clear,"" answered Austin. The defense official said that the updates for commanders and personnel involved with Department of Defense-controlled intelligence gathering was to ensure proper guidance for the ""amount, content and type of information"" being provided about adversary operations in the Donbas region. Last month, the White House acknowledged that the US has sent ""a significant amount of detailed, timely intelligence"" to Ukraine regarding Russia's plans and movements. ""We've been doing that for months,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at the time. ""This includes information that should help them inform and develop their military response to Russia's invasion, that's what's happening -- or has been happening.""",49,4.729735643192758,2.7461206991552505,1.983614944037508,21
2022-04-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/europe/ukraine-russia-war-technology-intl-cmd/index.html,"Drones, phones and satellite technology are exposing the truth about Russia's war in Ukraine in near real-time","Russia's lies may be catching up with it faster than it ever imagined. The war in Ukraine is defying President Vladimir Putin's expectations at every turn, not only with Russia's failure to capture Kyiv as planned but with the war crimes his soldiers are alleged to have committed in Bucha, a city close the capital, exposed for the world to see. Throughout history, wars have been won by forces turning new technologies to their advantage. The 1415 victory of English King Henry V over the French at the Battle of Agincourt came courtesy of his archers and their newly developed longbows, raining arrows over a range the French could not match. The war in Ukraine may see another historic first, with technology cutting through the fog of war, exposing the aggressors' lies and accelerating efforts to bring about their defeat. Satellite images of murdered civilians that match videos, recorded weeks later, of bodies at the roadside are providing compelling evidence of Russian war crimes, convincing Western leaders to ramp up sanctions on Russia and accelerate weapons supplies for Ukraine. How this will affect the final outcome of the war is unclear. But what is evident at a time when Ukraine is urgently seeking any additional leverage as Russian forces regroup for a new offensive, is that Russia's actions in Bucha are strengthening Ukraine's hand. While battlefield satellite imagery has been available to governments for decades and was instrumental in pinpointing war crimes during the Bosnian civil war in the 1990s -- notably locating a mass grave of many of the 7,000 Bosnian Muslims slaughtered in the town of Srebrenica in 1995 -- it has never been so immediately available in the public domain as now. Putin and his battlefield commanders appear not to care or not to have grasped the fact that orders and actions now leave an indelible record beyond their control that could come back to haunt them. They will be aware that in many past conflicts -- even as recent as the Syrian civil war -- leaders like Bashar al Assad escaped conviction and have even been rehabilitated, despite vast troves of incriminating documents spirited from government offices and police stations. But this is not the only lesson to which Putin should pay attention. Following the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia and the Bosnian civil war, the war crimes tribunal in the Hague used political and military leaders' own words to help convict them. When the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) put Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic on trial, it had video of him looking over Sarajevo, condemning the civilians below to artillery and mortar fire. His military partner in war crimes there, General Ratko Mladic, also saw his words come back to help convict him, as video showed him on the outskirts of Srebrenica directing the filtering of civilians, many of whom would shortly be slaughtered by his soldiers, following his orders. That type of link may be harder to pin on Putin, but his 20-page thesis published last summer on why Ukraine is not a country, and his TV comments on why Russia should invade, will, if previous war crime courts are a precedent, count against him as author and director of the war. If Putin were to come to trial, his unravelling may turn out to have begun with his inability to understand his army's weaknesses and Ukraine's strengths. Failure to fulfil his first major objective, the capture of Kyiv, forced his troops to retreat, leaving their tide of terror exposed. They did what they have done so many times before, in Syria, in Chechnya, in Georgia: committed awful abuses. And Putin and his officials did what they have done so many time before: lied to cover their crimes. Russian defense officials claimed photos and videos that emerged on April 2, showing murdered civilians -- shot in the head, some with their hands and legs bound -- were fake, saying their troops left before the killings occurred. ""The troops left the city on March 30,"" the defense ministry said in a statement. ""Where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake."" They were very clear about the date. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, one of Putin's most seasoned spin masters, doubled down on the clumsy cover-up, insisting ""Russian forces left the Bucha town area as early as the 30th of March."" But publicly available satellite images from space-tech company Maxar, taken March 18 while Russian troops were in control, showed the civilians lying dead at the road side in exactly the same locations as Ukrainian forces discovered them when they re-entered the town in early April. And drone video shot before March 10 showed a cyclist being shot and killed by Russian troops. Ukrainian forces found his body weeks later, exactly where he fell. In the months prior to Russia's invasion and the days since Maxar's images appeared, tracking Russian forces and their destruction, the public's understanding of the battlefield has been revolutionized. Coupled with the near-ubiquitous use of smartphone cameras, geolocation technology and sophisticated drones, Putin faces the possible reckoning he escaped in previous conflicts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants more cameras, and wider access, to let the public see for themselves: ""This is what we are interested in, maximum access for journalists, maximum cooperation with international institutions, enrolment of the International Criminal Court, complete truth and full accountability,"" he said in a video address on Monday. Ukraine's enigmatic leader has realized it's not just high-tech, tank-busting weapons like Javelins and NLAWs, or surface-to-air missiles like Stingers and Starstreaks, that could turn the tide in the war. It's truth, and the tools -- satellites, drones and smartphones -- to deliver it. Unparalleled in any modern war, technology could hand the underdog this surprising advantage, undermining the lies of an oversized aggressor. Zelensky was at pains for the United Nations to understand this when he spoke to them Tuesday: ""It is 2022 now. We have conclusive evidence. There are satellite images. And we can conduct full and transparent investigations."" Like Henry V in 1415, Zelensky knows an advantage when he sees it. While satellite imagery may not be as game-changing as a six-foot yew branch and a length of hemp string, if he can use it cleverly, he may force Putin to talks much sooner than the Russian President would like.",45,5.908680620852077,4.373865070021727,1.5348155508303494,3

Over the next few weeks, officials expect Russian forces to resupply and reposition with the aim of launching a brutal new offensive in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday. ""They will be rearmed, because they've used a lot of ammunition,"" Stoltenberg said, ""and they will be resupplied with fuel and all the things they need, food and so on, to launch a new big offensive."" It is still unclear what Putin's long-term goals are, a senior defense official said. But despite the recent shift in strategy and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine peace talks, the US and its allies are preparing for the possibility that Putin tries to reinvade the Kyiv region once he completes his objectives in the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, assuming he has enough manpower and equipment left to do so, US and European officials told CNN. ""In order to protect any territory it seizes in the east, we expect that Russia could potentially extend its force projection and presence even deeper into Ukraine, beyond Luhansk and Donetsk provinces,"" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Monday. ""At least that is their intention and their plan."" Sullivan added that the US expects Russia to continue launching air and missile strikes across Ukraine, including against the cities of Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv and Lviv. ""Russia's goal, in the end, is to weaken Ukraine as much as possible,"" he said. US, European and Ukrainian officials told CNN that they don't believe Russia is negotiating with Ukraine in good faith, and that the talks are little more than a ""smokescreen."" The officials also said they don't believe Putin has abandoned his goal of removing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Western-aligned government in Kyiv. ""While Moscow may be interested now in using military pressure to find a political settlement, if this offensive in the east proves to gain some traction, Russia could regenerate forces for additional goals, including trying to gain control of yet more territory within Ukraine,"" Sullivan said in his Tuesday remarks. US intelligence suggests that while Russia may try to reattack elsewhere, such an operation may have limited success given the heavy losses its military has already sustained over the last six weeks, said one of the sources familiar with the US assessments. But Russian forces are resupplying as they move east, leaving Western governments actively -- yet informally -- weighing the kinds of security guarantees they could provide Ukraine that could deter any renewed Russian offensives. The officials said they still believe the clearest path to ending the war is for Ukraine to decisively push out Russian forces, which is why NATO members and Europe have continued to pour military equipment into the country. ""There is only one way out of the war,"" said a European official. ""And that is for Ukraine to win.""",4,4.129790235468774,5.409629674076822,-1.2798394386080476,9

""As the indictment charges, the Treasury Department previously identified Malofeyev as one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea, and for providing material support for the so-called Donetsk People's Republic,"" Garland said. ""After being sanctioned by the United States, Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to surreptitiously acquire and run media outlets across Europe."" Garland touted the new indictment among several actions the Justice Department has taken against the Russian regime at a news conference Wednesday. He also announced that a botnet that was being controlled by the by the Russian military intelligence agency known as the GRU had been disrupted. In addition, the Justice Department is assisting with the collection of evidence for potential war crimes prosecutions related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""I personally spoke with our chief Justice Department prosecutor in Paris who was meeting with a French war crimes prosecutor,"" Garland said. ""The day before, criminal division prosecutors met with prosecutors from Eurojust and Europol to work out a plan for gathering evidence with respect to Ukraine. And at the same time, the United States is, at the request of the Ukrainian prosecutor, assisting in the collection of information with respect to the atrocities that took place in Ukraine."" Garland noted the ""horrible images"" that have come out of Ukraine recently. ""The world sees what is happening in Ukraine. The Justice Department sees what is happening in Ukraine. This department has a long history of helping to hold accountable those who perpetrate war crimes,"" he said. Garland says the department is sending a 'message' to enablers of the Russian regime The charges against Malofeyev were filed in the Southern District of New York and were the first criminal charges brought by the Justice Department against a Russian oligarch since Russia invaded Ukraine, Monaco said at the press conference. In a press release unveiling the indictment, FBI assistant director Michael Driscoll accused Malofeyev of playing ""leading role in supporting Russia's 2014 invasion of eastern Ukraine,"" and said Malofeyev ""continues to run a pro-Putin propaganda network, and recently described Russia's 2022 military invasion of Ukraine as a 'holy war.'"" In addition to the sanctions violation charges, the department said it had seized Malofeyev funds being held in a US bank account. The new indictment links Malofeyev to an American television producer the Department previously charged for allegedly violating US sanctions tied to Russia's takeover of Crimea. Garland touted the new charges along with the disruption of the GRU botnet, which is a bot that can hack and steal information. ""The Russian government has recently used similar infrastructure to attack Ukrainian targets,"" Garland said. ""Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used. Thanks to our close work with international partners, we were able to detect the infection of thousands of network hardware devices."" The new actions come in addition to a yacht -- owned by another Kremlin tied oligarch facing sanctions, Victor Vekselberg -- that was seized earlier this week. Additionally, Garland said Wednesday, the Justice Department, in coordination with its German law enforcement partners, seized the ""Russia-affiliated Hydra darknet market -- the world's largest illegal marketplace on the dark web."" Charges had been brought, according to Garland, against a Russian national who allegedly administered the market's technical infrastructure. Monaco said that the Hydra market exchange was facilitating the buying and selling of a ""staggering variety"" of illicit goods in Russian-speaking countries. Garland vowed that the Department ""will continue to work alongside our international partners to hold accountable those who break our laws, threaten our national security, and harm our allies. ""Our message to those who continue to enable the Russian regime through their criminal conduct is this: It does not matter how far you sail your yacht. It does not matter how well you conceal your assets. It does not matter how cleverly you write your malware or hide your online activity,"" Garland said. ""The Justice Department will use every available tool to find you, disrupt your plots, and hold you accountable.""",20,4.760646368500547,5.031687044910127,-0.2710406764095801,10
2022-04-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/europe/bucha-ukraine-russian-occupation-reality-intl-cmd/index.html,"Bodies tied up, shot and left to rot in Bucha hint at gruesome reality of Russia's occupation in Ukraine","The Russian column of tanks and armored personnel carriers sped along a residential street in Bucha, a tree-lined suburb of the capital Kyiv. That was February 27th. A short time later, that same line of vehicles lay in ruins, the wreckage smoldering, after being ambushed by Ukrainian forces. There was no sign of the column's soldiers. In a video showing the destruction, a man could be heard muttering: ""I wish you all to burn in hell."" But that Ukrainian victory was to be short-lived; a month-long occupation of Bucha by Russian forces followed. The suburb's name has this week become a byword for war crimes, after accounts of summary executions, brutality and indiscriminate shelling emerged in the wake of Russia's hasty retreat, as the Kremlin shifts its focus away from the Ukrainian capital to the country's east. In recent days, Moscow has claimed -- without evidence -- that the atrocities in Bucha were staged -- calling it ""fake,"" and part of a ""planned media campaign."" But witnesses who spoke to CNN said the carnage in the town began weeks ago. And the devastation there bears similarities to Russia's playbook in other towns and cities in Ukraine, where officials say civilian infrastructure has come under attack -- with power supplies knocked out, water cut off and communications towers damaged -- making it harder for local residents to hold out against Russian troops. But Ukraine has not surrendered. There have also been reports of looting, disappearances, and evidence of the indiscriminate killings of civilians since the war began. Horrors on the road Bucha -- once a magnet for young families due to its affordable homes, green spaces, and good schools -- and other areas nearby, turned into a living nightmare in March as Russian troops stormed the region. Residents there share difficult to verify stories of looted homes, senseless murders and failed escapes via Kyiv's Zhytomyr highway -- now a graveyard for wrecked tanks and burned-out cars. In Bucha, pitch-roofed homes crumbled under the force of Russian artillery strikes. Residents say they had no choice but to turn their vegetable patches and front yards into makeshift graves, since the presence of Russian forces made it impossible to reach the morgue or local cemetery. Anna Bilous, 48, had lived in Bucha for eight years before the Russian troops arrived. She sheltered in her home with her husband and two sons, but around March 4, when the electricity cut out and the pipes ran dry, it became clear they had to leave, she told CNN. They decided that Bilous and her two sons would flee on foot, heading for the nearby suburb of Irpin on March 9, while her husband stayed behind to care for the family's elderly neighbors. The trio traveled on side roads to avoid the Russian soldiers, but when they turned onto Yablunska Street, the family was stunned to find dead bodies scattered across the road -- including one lifeless man collapsed under a bicycle. Bilous believes the man's body remained there for close to a month, until he and some 20 other civilians were photographed for the world to see this past weekend. Bucha's mayor has described their deaths as an execution. Bilous' account and satellite images captured on March 18, shared by Maxar Technologies, show that the bodies had lain in the street for weeks, since the town was under Russian control -- Russia held Bucha until March 31. On Tuesday, the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov continued to deny the accusations of brutal civilian killings in Bucha, saying the claims are not only ""groundless, but are a well-staged tragic show"" and ""a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army."" Reports of executions About a mile away, at a sanatorium in Vokzal'na Street on Monday, Ukrainian officials ushered journalists into a cold basement where the contorted and bloodied bodies of five men lay in an advanced state of decay. Some of those in this dimly-lit space had been kneecapped. Others, their arms bound behind their backs, had been shot multiple times. Bullet casings littered the ground. Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the Ukrainian interior minister, said it was a cruel display of torture and execution by Russian soldiers. CNN cannot independently verify his claim. The men were killed sometime in the last three weeks, officials say. Their bodies are as yet unidentified, since no personal documents have been found. In a statement, the Russian Ministry of Defense has denied anyone was harmed. ""Taking into account that the troops left the city on March 30, where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake."" Officials say Russian forces bedded down in the sanatorium around the second week of March. Several foxholes, trenches, and positions for armored vehicles remain visible around the site; leftover Russian rations have been abandoned nearby. Soldiers have daubed the exterior walls of the facility with the letter ""V,"" a symbol used by Russia's Eastern Military District, and used synonymously with the letter ""Z,"" as an emblem for Russia's ""special military operation."" The gruesome scene proved too much for Vladislav Minchenko, who vomited after volunteering to help remove the bodies from the basement on Monday. ""This is not what we learned in school,"" said Minchenko, 44, who worked as a painter before the war. Holding up his hands, Minchenko told CNN the number of dead bodies he had dealt with since the start of the conflict numbered in the ""hundreds -- not dozens -- hundreds."" Hasty burials in mass grave Shelling, live fire, and trigger-happy Russian soldiers made it too dangerous for those injured in the assault on Bucha to seek treatment at the local hospital in the center of town, according to residents. The local morgue in Bucha ran out of space as deaths mounted in March; to deal with all the bodies, a tractor was brought in to dig a mass grave in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, its abbot, Andriy Galavin told CNN. ""There were too many dead people, and there was no way to properly bury them because getting to the cemetery was simply unrealistic because of the shelling,"" Galavin said. There was also a lack of resources, such as coffins, due to the main bridge connecting Bucha to Irpin being blown up at the start of the war, Galavin said. As of this weekend, Kyiv Regional Police and residents believed the remains of at least 150 people had been laid to rest in the grave, but the mayor of Bucha said the death toll could be as high as 300. CNN could not independently verify those claims. Galavin returned to Bucha last week once the town was liberated; he said the plan was to exhume the bodies, identify them via DNA analysis and hopefully provide some solace to relatives still searching for missing loved ones. Tip of the iceberg The devastation wrought in Bucha is just the tip of the iceberg, Ukrainian President Zelensky warned on Monday. ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago,"" President Zelensky said. ""The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this."" One grisly example of the callous indifference for human life was found in Motyzhyn, a village around 20 miles south of Bucha. The local mayor, Olga Sukhenko, was discovered half-buried in a ditch alongside members of her family. Ukrainian officials said Saturday that she was killed after being captured by Russian forces. And, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says that 11 local mayors are being held by the Russians, which CNN cannot verify. ""Unfortunately, so far, we have not been able to get in touch or to free any other city mayors and we don't even know, we think that some of them were killed,"" she told CNN, promising that the perpetrators would pay for their crimes against Ukraine. ""We will find them and kill them, and we will punish everyone who killed our city mayors, our journalists, our priests, our activists."" As Ukrainian officials race to clear mines and booby traps left by retreating Russian troops, they fear civilian casualties may be much higher in Borodyanka, 14 miles west of Bucha. Oksana Kostychenko and her husband Oleksandr returned home to Borodyanka over the weekend after fleeing the area on February 27. They discovered that their house had been trashed and looted by Russian soldiers. The couple also found a dead man in their backyard. His arms were tied behind his back, and his trousers had been pulled down. ""Alcohol is everywhere. Empty bottles in the hallway, under things,"" Oksana said. ""They smoked a lot, put out cigarettes on the table... They lived here as they wished."" Anna Bilous and her sons made it out of Bucha on March 10. But the fate of the dead man they saw lying beneath a bicycle as they fled still haunts her. ""I feel like me and my sons could be in the same place as the man who died,"" she said. ""I feel the pain and sadness of all these lost people.""",45,5.609214643189253,4.103256004678519,1.5059586385107337,3
2022-04-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/world/zelensky-ukraine-united-nations-speech-intl/index.html,Ukraine's Zelensky questions UN Security Council's mandate in speech on alleged Russian atrocities,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of indiscriminately killing civilians ""just for their pleasure"" in an emotionally-charged address to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, before questioning the very mandate of the Security Council itself. Zelensky's speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend. On Tuesday, he related the aftermath of Russia's retreat from the town in horrifying detail, describing entire families killed, people with their throats slashed, and women raped and killed in front of their children. Zelensky said Russia's actions were no different from those of a terror group, except that Russia is a permanent member of the UNSC. The Ukrainian leader then criticized the body, asking representatives point blank: ""Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It is not there, though there is a Security Council."" Zelensky added: ""It is obvious that the key institution of the world designed to combat aggression and ensure peace cannot work effectively. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you of Article 1, Chapter 1 of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? Its purpose is to maintain and make sure that peace is adhered to. And now the UN charter is violated literally starting with Article 1. And so what is the point of all other Articles?"" he asked. At least 1,480 civilians have been killed and at least 2,195 have been injured in Ukraine between the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 and April 4, a UN official said at the meeting, citing updated numbers from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The latest figures on the number of Ukrainian civilians in the conflict had ""more than doubled"" since the last briefing to the UNSC on March 17. In Bucha, bodies strewn across the streets and in basements were found by human rights groups and documented by independent journalists. Satellite images suggest some bodies had been there since at least March 18. In his damning speech, Zelensky said there was ""not a single crime"" that the Russians ""would not commit,"" alleging that Russian troops had ""searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country."" ""They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone ... They killed entire families, adults and children and they tried to burn the bodies,"" Zelensky said. ""I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased every single day and in the memory of the civilians who died, who were shot and killed in the back of their head after being tortured,"" he told the UNSC. ""Some of them were shot on the streets. Others were thrown into wells, so they died there suffering. They were killed in their apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road, just for their pleasure,"" he continued. ""Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them."" Zelensky also warned that the horrors found in Bucha would be replicated in other cities across Ukraine. Demanding accountability, he called for any Russians who have given ""criminal orders"" and ""carried out them by killing our people"" to be brought before a tribunal, similar to the Nuremberg trials that occurred after World War II when Nazis were put on trial. UN: Civilians were targeted Separately, the United Nations on Tuesday said that the shocking images from Bucha showed ""all the signs"" that civilians were ""directly targeted and directly killed."" In a virtual press briefing, OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell said the reports emerging from Bucha and other areas were ""very disturbing developments."" She specifically referenced the ""disturbing"" images of people with their hands tied behind their back and of partially naked women whose bodies have been burnt as further evidence suggesting the direct targeting of individuals. ""We have been talking about war crimes in the context of shelling, bombardment, and artillery attacks. Now they need to be investigated. But you could argue there was a military context, for example, to a building being hit. It's hard to see what was the military context of an individual lying in the street with a bullet to the head or having their bodies burned,"" Throssell continued. As the OHCHR is trying to currently gain access to Bucha, she didn't have ""exact information"" to share regarding the situation on the ground. Throssell also paid tribute to the ""crucial role"" that journalists are playing in documenting these scenes, mentioning the ""multiple teams"" involved in ""reporting, analyzing, and sending video footage."" Russia's response Russia has repeatedly denied the alleged atrocities, despite increasing evidence suggesting otherwise. Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations responded to Zelensky's remarks, calling the accusations against the Russian military ""ungrounded."" ""We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military, which are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses,"" Nebenzia said in translated remarks. The ambassador recalled Zelensky's election to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019, stating that hopes that Zelensky would end the fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine ""failed to materialize."" Nebenzia also repeated past claims that ""a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military"" continue to proliferate. Addressing Zelensky directly, Nebenzia concluded his remarks by claiming Russia ""came to ... Ukraine"" to bring peace, not to ""conquer lands."" Nebenzia's words echoed those of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier Tuesday, who called the allegations not only ""groundless, but ... a well-staged tragic show"" and ""a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army.""",45,2.951383170545908,5.514202741771237,-2.5628195712253294,3
2022-04-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/politics/mark-milley-ukraine-reaction-international-conflict/index.html,Top US general: Potential for 'significant international conflict' is increasing,"The top US military officer told lawmakers Tuesday that the world is becoming more unstable and the ""potential for significant international conflict is increasing, not decreasing."" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin appeared before the House Armed Services Committee in their first testimony before Congress since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The two Pentagon leaders said the threats from both Russia and China remain significant, while they defended the US approach to the war and the flow of arms the US is sending to Ukraine. Milley said that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ""the greatest threat to peace and security of Europe and perhaps the world"" in his 42 years serving in the US military, but added it was ""heartening"" to see the world rally around Ukraine. ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine is threatening to undermine not only European peace and stability but global peace and stability that my parents and a generation of Americans fought so hard to defend,"" Milley said. ""We are now facing two global powers: China and Russia, each with significant military capabilities both who intend to fundamentally change the rules based current global order,"" Milley added. ""We are entering a world that is becoming more unstable and the potential for significant international conflict is increasing, not decreasing."" Lawmakers in both parties focused at the hearing on the weapons that were being provided to Ukraine, asking whether more could be done as Ukraine has continued to ask for additional capabilities. ""One of the biggest questions we're going to have in this committee is, 'How can we do more?'"" House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat, said at the top of the hearing. ""How can we make sure we're doing absolutely everything we can to help them?"" Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the panel's top Republican, said he would support the US setting up permanent bases in eastern NATO countries like Poland and the Baltics in order to deter Russia. Milley said that he would support establishing permanent bases but added that he thought US forces should rotate through them to create a deterrent without incurring the costs of moving family, establishing schools and other measures required when a permanent US base is established abroad. ""I believe a lot of our European allies, especially those such as in the Baltics or Poland or Romania or elsewhere, they are very, very willing to establish permanent bases,"" Milley said. ""They'll build them, they'll pay for them, etc., for us to cycle through on a rotational basis. So you get the effect of permanent presence of forces, but the actual individual soldiers, sailors, airmen or Marines are not permanently stationed there for 2-3 years."" Austin said that NATO was still discussing how it should bolster its permanent presence in eastern Europe. ""If NATO deems that it's appropriate to change its footprint, then certainly we'll be a part of that,"" Austin said. Several Republicans asked Milley and Austin whether the US failed in its efforts to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from attacking Ukraine. Milley responded that he did not think Putin could have been deterred unless US forces had deployed from Ukraine -- a scenario he would have advised against had it been proposed. ""Candidly, short of the commitment of US military forces into Ukraine proper, I'm not sure he was deterrable. This has been a long-term objective of his that goes back years,"" Milley said. ""I think the idea of deterring Putin from invading Ukraine, deterring him by the United States, would have required the commitment of US military forces, and I think that would have risked armed conflict with Russia, which I certainly wouldn't have advised."" Milley noted that sanctions ""have a very poor track record of deterring aggression,"" but said they have succeeded in imposing significant costs to Russia for its aggression. ""The objective of the sanctions is to impose significant costs if he invaded, those significant costs, the sanctions in combination with the export controls, are breaking the back of the Russian economy as we speak,"" he said. Austin later added that had the US ""put forces into Ukraine to fight Putin, this would be a different story."" ""But we made a decision that we weren't going to do that and we made the decision for the right reasons, and I support those decisions,"" Austin said, adding he did not want to speculate on what Chinese leaders might extrapolate from what's transpired in Ukraine as it related to Taiwan. Milley defended the US military's policy requiring troops to receive Covid-19 vaccinations in response to several queries from Republicans questioning whether service members should be discharged for refusing to be vaccinated when Army recruiting numbers were down. Milley noted that service members have to receive numerous vaccinations as part of joining the military, like an Anthrax vaccine, and said that the Covid-19 vaccine contributed to force readiness. In a heated moment, Austin got into an argument with Rep. Matt Gaetz after the Florida Republican accused the Pentagon of being too focused on ""wokeism"" and not defense. Austin charged that Gaetz appeared to be ""embarrassed for his country"" by questioning the US military's capability, and the two men shouted over one another at several points. Gaetz charged that the Pentagon ""got it wrong"" by predicting that Russia would overrun Ukraine within days and that the Taliban would not take control of Afghanistan last year. ""You totally blew those calls and maybe we would be better at them if the National Defense University actually worked a little more on strategy and a little less on wokeism,"" Gaetz said. ""Has it occurred to you that Russia has not overrun Ukraine because of what we've done and what our allies have done?"" Austin asked. ""Have you ever even thought about that?""",4,5.839311139971295,3.394485337136363,2.4448258028349326,26
2022-04-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/politics/us-hypersonic-missile-test/index.html,US tested hypersonic missile in mid-March but kept it quiet to avoid escalating tensions with Russia,"The US successfully tested a hypersonic missile in mid-March but kept it quiet for two weeks to avoid escalating tensions with Russia as President Joe Biden was about to travel to Europe, according to a defense official familiar with the matter. The Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) was launched from a B-52 bomber off the west coast, the official said, in the first successful test of the Lockheed Martin version of the system. A booster engine accelerated the missile to high speed, at which point the air-breathing scramjet engine ignited and propelled the missile at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5 and above. The official offered scant details of the missile test, only noting the missile flew above 65,000 feet and for more than 300 miles. But even at the lower end of hypersonic range -- about 3,800 miles per hour -- a flight of 300 miles is less than 5 minutes. The test came days after Russia says it used its own hypersonic missile during its invasion of Ukraine, claiming it targeted an ammunition warehouse in western Ukraine. US officials downplayed the significance of the Russian use of their hypersonic Kinzhal missile. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he did not view it as ""some sort of game changer"" after the Russians announced the missile launch. Days later, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said it was ""hard to know what exactly the justification"" was for the launch, since it targeted a stationary storage facility. ""That's a pretty significant sledgehammer to take out a target like that,"" Kirby said at the time. The Kinzhal missile is simply an air-launched version of the Russian Iskander short-range ballistic missile. In other words, it is a variation of an established technology as opposed to a revolution in hypersonic weaponry. The US test was of a more sophisticated and difficult air-breathing scramjet engine. The HAWC missile also has no warhead, instead relying on its kinetic energy to destroy the target. At the time of the US test, Biden was preparing for a visit to NATO allies in Europe, including a stop in Poland where he met with Ukraine's foreign minister and defense minister. The US has been careful not to take steps or make statements that could unnecessarily escalate the tensions between Washington and Moscow. On Friday, the US canceled a test of the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to avoid any misinterpretation by Russia. Austin had already postponed the test in early March to avoid any actions that could be misconstrued by Russia at such a sensitive time. In general, the US has also remained somewhat discreet about the weapons and equipment it sends into Ukraine. Only in the latest $300 million security assistance package did the Defense Department list specific systems and weapons. The US has also opposed the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine through the United States, concerned that the Kremlin could interpret such a move as the US and NATO entering the conflict in Ukraine. US officials remained quiet about this latest hypersonic test for two weeks for similar reasons, the defense official said, careful not to provoke the Kremlin or President Vladimir Putin, especially as Russian forces expanded their bombardment of Ukraine. The US test is the second successful test of a HAWC missile, and it is the first of the Lockheed Martin version of the weapon. Last September, the Air Force tested the Raytheon HAWC, powered by a Northrop Grumman scramjet engine. The test met all primary objectives, according to a press release from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), including the missile's integration and release, safe separation from the launch aircraft, booster firing, and cruise. Then too officials offered few details about the flight, with no mention of how fast the missile flew or what distance it traveled. The release only stated that the missile traveled at speeds greater than Mach 5. The US has placed a renewed emphasis on hypersonic weapons following successful Russian and Chinese tests in recent months, exacerbating the concern in Washington that the US is falling behind on a military technology considered critical for the future. In the FY23 defense budget, the Biden administration has requested $7.2 billion for long range fires, including hypersonic missiles. In a report last year, the Government Accountability Office identified 70 efforts related to the development of hypersonic weapons, expected to cost nearly $15 billion between 2015 and 2024. One month after the first successful HAWC test, the US suffered a setback when the test of a different hypersonic system failed. The failure came just as reports emerged that China had successfully tested a hypersonic glide vehicle over the summer and shortly after Russia claimed to have successfully tested its submarine-launched hypersonic missile, dubbed the Tsirkon.",49,5.736544522042604,8.157627914092362,-2.4210833920497583,12
2022-04-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/politics/bucha-putin-war-crimes-what-matters/index.html,Ukraine's dilemma: How to negotiate with someone who could be a war criminal,"When the war criminal is a world leader, how do you negotiate with him? The mounting evidence of Russian atrocities -- over the weekend, it was in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv -- led US President Joe Biden to say Monday that Vladimir Putin must be put on trial. That truth is complicated by the hard fact that this war is most likely to end through negotiations with Putin, whose hold on power in Russia seems absolute. Making the case against Putin We have written here before about the difficulty in international law of finding accountability for someone like Putin, the leader of a nuclear-armed, gas-producing nation. That was before horrible pictures showing dead civilians left on a street in Bucha. RELATED: CNN's Nathan Hodge looks at the well-documented brutality of the Russian military. Biden had previously said he felt Putin was a war criminal, and the reports from Bucha led him to say a methodical case must be built to put the Russian leader on trial. ""We have to get all the details so this can be an actual -- have a war crime trial,"" Biden told reporters in Washington. ""This guy is brutal and what's happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone's seen it."" Putin is also the key to ending violence When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toured the wreckage in Bucha, he noted the obvious. ""It's very difficult to negotiate when you see what they have done here,"" Zelensky said. From CNN's report: Wearing a flak jacket and surrounded by security, he talked about ""key leaders of leading countries who made the decisions whether Ukraine should be a NATO member."" ""I think they should come here and see how these games, how this flirting with the Russian federation ends,"" he said. At some point, Zelensky will likely have to negotiate directly with Putin for the war to end. Earlier in the weekend, Ukrainian negotiators had said they were approaching the point where ""direct consultations"" between the two might be possible. Creating a 'mechanism for justice' In separate remarks Sunday, Zelensky said he is also looking for a new ""mechanism of justice"" to investigate crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukrainian territory. ""This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said. Officials with the European Union, which Ukraine also wants to join, have said they have established a joint investigation team with Ukraine to probe alleged Russian war crimes. All of this is alongside efforts by the International Criminal Court, which has launched its own investigation into Russia's activities in Ukraine. Putin's protection Putin's power in Russia seems, for now, to be strong, which makes it nearly impossible to put him on trial, as Biden suggests, according to Kenneth Rodman, a political scientist at Colby College who has studied war crimes and the ICC. In every previous instance, ""to prosecute someone you actually have to defeat them or they have to be overthrown in some kind of coup or political process,"" he told me in a phone conversation. That was the case with both Nazi and Japanese leaders after World War II, and with the Bosnian, Serbian and Rwandan leaders of the 1990s. ""If they haven't been defeated, you have to negotiate with them,"" Rodman said. Getting past immunity for world leaders The agreement that created the International Criminal Court -- the Rome Statute -- not only prohibits trials in absentia but also seems to immunize leaders who are in power from prosecution, according to Rodman. I asked a former ICC official, James Goldston, who is now executive director of the Open Society Justice Initiative, if the world has the apparatus to prosecute someone like Putin. He agreed with Rodman that heads of state are generally granted immunity from prosecution. But Goldston sent along a passage from the Rome Statute -- it ""shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular, official capacity as a Head of State or Government"" -- and said the International Criminal Court could use it to justify a case against Putin. There are also proposals to set up a special international body focused specifically on aggression in Ukraine, Goldston said. Multiple ideas have been suggested: A state could try to hold its own prosecution of Putin under the international legal theory of ""universal jurisdiction."" Germany did this when it tried a former member of the Syrian regime. Or the United Nations could set up a special tribunal specifically to look at Russia's and Putin's actions. Moving up the chain of command For now, any war crimes effort is likely to start at lower levels, with Russians on the ground in Ukraine. Here's a passage from Goldston's email to me: There are many persons who are responsible for the crimes now being committed in Ukraine. Often international criminal investigations begin with the ""crime base"" -- authenticated images, witness testimonies and other evidence concerning killings, torture, rape or other prohibited offenses which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity -- and proceed upward along a chain of military or political authority to demonstrate the culpability of those who ordered, or who knew of but failed to prevent/punish, the commission of such crimes. Negotiating with 'bloody hands' Accountability for Russians' alleged actions in Ukraine is one thing -- and stopping the war right now is another. ""The idea is you want to hold people accountable and end the culture of impunity that allows for this kind of behavior,"" said Rodman. ""On the other hand, ending civil conflicts requires negotiating with people with bloody hands,"" Rodman told me, pointing to negotiations the US and others undertook with the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in 1995 or negotiations between the African National Congress and the apartheid regime. ""It's a basic dilemma in international relations."" Here's a photo of Bill Clinton celebrating the Dayton Peace Agreement behind Milosevic. Milosevic later died in jail while awaiting trial as a war criminal, but only after he lost elections in 2000 and fell from power in Serbia and Yugoslavia. Goldston, the former war crimes prosecutor, said the need for accountability cannot be lost. ""The lessons of past conflicts overwhelmingly suggest that no peace will be sustainable if founded on impunity for those most criminally responsible,"" he said.",45,5.504580256508014,2.455921419631476,3.048658836876538,3
2022-04-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/europe/russia-military-culture-brutality-intl/index.html,"In Russia's military, a culture of brutality runs deep","The grotesque pictures emerging from the Kyiv suburb of Bucha are some of the strongest evidence yet of apparent war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine: Dead civilians on the street, some with hands bound and shot execution-style, others apparently mowed down at random. For anyone who has followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's way of war, it's a depressingly familiar pattern. Russia's military has a culture of brutality and scorn for the laws of armed conflict that has been extensively documented in the past. ""The history of Russia's military interventions -- be it in Ukraine or Syria, or its military campaign at home in Chechnya -- is tainted with blatant disregard for international humanitarian law,"" said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International's Secretary General. ""The Russian military repeatedly flouted the laws of war by failing to protect civilians and even attacking them directly. Russian forces have launched indiscriminate attacks, used banned weapons and sometimes apparently deliberately targeted civilians and civilian objects -- a war crime."" That statement, made less than a month before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has proven sadly prophetic. In the opening weeks of the war, the international community reacted with horror as Ukrainian cities came under relentless Russian bombardment. Protected civilian infrastructure was hit, much as Russian aircraft once targeted Syrian schools and hospitals. But the scenes unfolding in places like Bucha suggest an intimate kind of violence, something reminiscent of Russia's war in Chechnya. During the second Chechen war -- which coincided with Putin's rise to power -- allegations also surfaced of widespread human-rights abuse by Russian troops. In 2000, to cite just one well-known incident, investigators with Human Rights Watch documented the summary execution of at least 60 civilians in two suburbs of Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. Locals unearthed mass graves in Chechnya; international officials made fact-finding trips to the region and made concerned statements about the reports of abuse and extrajudicial killings. Those statements did not stop Russia's military from grinding ahead with its ruthless pacification campaign. Similar evidence of summary executions abounds in towns such as Bucha. A CNN team visited the basement of one building and saw the bodies of five men before they were removed by a Ukrainian team. An adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, told CNN that the five men had been tortured and executed by Russian soldiers. CNN cannot independently verify Gerashchenko's claims. But equally troubling is the alleged treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian forces. The Ukrainian parliament's human rights ombudsman, Liudmyla Denisova, said Monday that Russia's treatment of prisoners of war violates the Geneva Conventions, laying out a theoretical case for potential war crimes prosecutions. In a Facebook post on Monday, Denisova said that released Ukrainian soldiers have ""told of the inhumane treatment of them by the Russian side: they were kept in a field, in a pit, in a garage. Periodically, one was taken out: beaten with rifle butts, shots fired next to their ear, intimidated."" CNN cannot independently verify Denisova's claims. Igor Zhdanov, a correspondent for the Russian state propaganda outlet RT, posted videos on March 22 depicting Ukrainian prisoners of war being processed for ""filtration"" -- Zhdanov's choice of word -- after they were captured. The videos show masked Russians searching their captives for tattoos or insignia, which would supposedly show affiliation with nationalists or ""neo-Nazi"" groups that the Russians have cast as their main enemy in Ukraine. Zhdanov said in his post that Ukrainian POWs were being treated humanely. But his choice of words was ominous. During the war in Chechnya, Russian forces notoriously used so-called ""filtration camps"" used to separate civilians from rebel fighters. Legendary Russian investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya gathered testimony from Chechen civilians detained in filtration centers, where detainees said they were held in pits and subjected to electric shock, beatings and ruthless interrogation. Russian forces have also targeted local Ukrainian mayors for detention -- and in at least one case, Ukrainian officials say, an extrajudicial killing. ""At the moment, 11 local mayors from Kyiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Donetsk regions are in Russian captivity,"" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a message posted on social media Sunday. She said the Ukrainian government learnt Saturday that Olga Sukhenko, the mayor of Motyzhyn, a village in the Kyiv region, was killed in the custody of Russian forces. Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the southern city of Melitopol -- who was detained by Russian forces but subsequently freed as part of a prisoner exchange -- said Russian forces occupying his city were appropriating local businesses, saying that the ""situation is difficult, because Russian soldiers have declared themselves as authorities but of course, they don't care about people and their problems, they only care about taking the money from the businessmen, [and seizing] their businesses."" Long before the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military had a reputation for a culture of cruelty. Russia has a hybrid manpower system of contract soldiers and conscripts. Although the Russian government claims to have made strides in professionalizing its forces, the country's military still has a brutal hazing system known as dedovshchina, a notorious tradition that encourages senior conscripts to beat, brutalize or even rape younger conscripts. Putin recently announced a decree on spring conscription, fixing a target for 134,500 individuals to be called up into the Russian armed forces. The Russian President originally claimed that Russian conscripts would not take part in what Russia has euphemistically dubbed the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. But the Russian Ministry of Defense subsequently acknowledged that draftees were fighting in Ukraine, and Ukrainian forces claim to have taken a considerable number of Russian conscripts prisoner. Ukrainian investigators are already launching criminal probes of alleged crimes by Russian forces as more areas are freed from Russian control -- particularly around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. It will be days, or perhaps weeks, before we get a fuller picture of what happened in Bucha. But if the past is any guide, there is little hope that Russian perpetrators would be brought to justice.",45,5.472578442649739,4.646115374069224,0.826463068580515,3

That's how Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the shocking images of at least 20 civilian men's bodies strewn across the street in Bucha, northwest of the capital of Kyiv, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities, including the horrific images of dead civilians captured by Agence France-Presse, are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital. ""The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,"" Zelensky said Sunday on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" when asked if Russia is carrying out genocide. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths. Russia responds. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the extensive footage of dead bodies in Bucha was ""fake,"" saying ""not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions,"" during Russia's occupation of Bucha. ""In the settlements of the Kiev region, Russian military personnel delivered and issued 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians,"" it said in a statement. A separate statement claimed the footage was staged. The Russian government has consistently responded to allegations of civilian casualties inflicted by Russian forces with blanket denials. Human Rights Watch documents alleged crimes. Rape, summary executions and unlawful violence are some of the war crimes allegedly perpetrated by Russian forces against civilians in the occupied areas of the Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions of Ukraine, according to Human Rights Watch, an independent rights group. HRW said in a statement Sunday that it has documented allegations of war crimes, which ""include a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022."" CNN has not independently verified the details of those reports and has requested comment from the Russian Ministry of Defense regarding the allegations. Urgent appeal at the Grammys. In a taped message shown at the Grammy Awards later Sunday, Zelensky made an urgent plea for support with a speech that began: ""The war. What's more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people."" ""Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos,"" he said at one point. ""They sing to the wounded. In hospitals."" Zelensky implored those listening to ""Tell the truth about war. On your social networks. On TV. Support us in any way you can. Any. But not silence."" CNN team observes a mass grave site. A mass grave has been discovered in the town of Bucha, CNN found. CNN saw at least a dozen bodies in body bags piled inside the grave. Some were already partially covered. Bodies were first buried in the grave, on the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, in the first days of the war, residents told CNN. Around 150 people, mostly civilians killed in the fighting around the town, are buried there, residents said. The mayor of Bucha said in public remarks on Saturday that there could be up to 300 victims buried on site. CNN was unable to independently verify those numbers or the identities and nationalities of those buried in the grave. 'A punch to the gut.' US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the State Department would help document any atrocities the Russian military committed against Ukrainian civilians. ""You can't help but see these images as a punch to the gut,"" Blinken told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" Sunday, responding to the reports from Bucha. Last month, the State Department formally accused Russian forces of war crimes in Ukraine. Asked Sunday whether Russian troops were committing genocide, Blinken didn't go as far as Zelensky. ""We will look hard and document everything that we see, put it all together, make sure that the relevant institutions and organizations that are looking at this, including the State Department, have everything they need to assess exactly what took place in Ukraine, who's responsible and what it amounts to,"" he said. New investigation coming? The top UN official said an ""independent investigation"" into the civilians killed in Bucha is ""essential"" to ensure ""effective accountability."" ""I am deeply shocked by the images of civilians killed in Bucha, Ukraine,"" UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement Sunday. More sanctions could be on the way. State Department spokesperson Ned Price, meanwhile, hinted at additional US action against Russia coming ""very soon"" when asked about Zelensky's request for greater G7 sanctions in response to the latest alleged atrocities in Bucha. ""When it comes to our sanctions, we've always said that we will continue applying pressure on President Putin, on the Kremlin, on all of those around him including oligarchs and cronies who are empowering this war of choice against Ukraine, until and unless the Kremlin deescalates, until and unless the violence diminishes, and until and unless these kinds of atrocities come to an end. So I suspect you will very soon see additional pressure applied,"" Price told MSNBC on Sunday. 'Not enough.' In a video address later on Sunday, in which he called for an end of Russian ""war crimes,"" Zelensky said of stronger sanctions against Russia: ""I'm sure that's not enough."" ""More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land,"" he added. Expect the attacks to continue. This is not a ""real withdrawal of Russian forces,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said, warning that attacks in Ukraine will continue. ""What we see is not a real withdrawal. But we see that Russia is repositioning its troops and they are taking some of them back to rearm them, to reinforce them, to resupply them. We should not in a way be too optimistic because the attacks will continue,"" Stoltenberg told CNN Sunday.

2022-04-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/politics/state-department-cyber-bureau/index.html,State Department launches cyberbureau amid concerns over Russia and China's digital authoritarianism,"The State Department's new cybersecurity bureau formally launched on Monday in an effort to make digital rights issues an intrinsic part of US foreign policy at a time when Russia and China are increasingly trying to put their own authoritarian stamp on the internet. The move essentially reshapes and greatly expands a bureaucratic structure, with a high-ranking cyber diplomat, that the Trump administration had effectively downgraded in the pursuit of cutting red tape. The new bureau is aimed at putting more diplomatic personnel and expertise toward State Department priorities such as shaping norms of responsible government behavior in cyberspace and helping US allies bolster their own cybersecurity programs. ""As what's happening in Ukraine and Russia illustrates, we're in a contest over the rules, infrastructure, and standards that will define our digital future,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in prepared remarks describing the role of the new Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy. ""Democracies must answer together the question of whether universal rights and democratic values will be at the center of our digital lives -- and whether digital technologies deliver real benefits in people's lives,"" Blinken said. Though US diplomats have continued to pursue cyber issues on a number of fronts, critics said then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's 2017 move to effectively downgrade the stature of the cybersecurity office within the department signaled to the world American disinterest in cyberspace. Then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo proposed a new cybersecurity bureau in the waning days of the Trump administration, but the initiative never got off the ground. Cybersecurity issues have only gotten more pressing in the years since. The iPhones of about a dozen State Department employees serving in Africa were hacked with spyware developed by Israeli technology firm NSO Group, CNN reported in December. The Biden administration has pledged to crack down on the use of such spyware, saying it has been used to violate human rights around the world. The new cyberbureau adds more personnel across multiple cyber-related issues, such as digital freedom and cybersecurity technologies, than existed under previous cybersecurity offices at the State Department. State Department officials said Monday that they expect to have 100 personnel staff the bureau by the end of the year. ""It's an evolution of the centrality of these issues for foreign policy to move from an office that was small into an institutionalized bureau within the department,"" a State Department official told CNN. Jennifer Bachus, a career diplomat, will lead the new bureau on an interim basis until the Biden administration nominates a Senate-confirmed ""ambassador-at-large"" to take the job, according to the State Department. ""I will work hard to make sure the bureau is appropriately structured and staffed for its mission: to elevate cyber and digital diplomacy globally, and to prioritize this work here in Washington and at our embassies and consulates,"" Bachus, who just returned from a diplomatic tour in the Czech Republic, told State Department colleagues on Monday. For at least the first year of its existence, the bureau will report directly to the deputy secretary of State. ""We want to make sure that it has priority attention from the senior most officials in this building,"" a State Department spokesperson said in an interview. Christopher Painter, who was the top cyber diplomat at the State Department until 2017, said the reinstatement of a top cybersecurity bureau could give the department more clout in interagency discussions about high-profile cyber issues. ""Where we talk about everything from economic tools that Treasury may be using to cyber tools that DOD [Department of Defense] may be using, it's important to have that diplomatic voice in there,"" Painter told CNN. This story has been updated with additional details.",20,6.085095112297044,4.169669696071677,1.915425416225367,10
2022-04-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/europe/russia-ukraine-catch-up-intl/index.html,Five important things that happened in Ukraine over the weekend,"It's been 39 days since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, but the true horrors of the war are only just becoming clear, as shocking images of carnage in the town of Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, show civilian bodies littering a street. Here are five important developments from this weekend. Mass graves and murdered civilians Nightmarish scenes of mass graves and murdered civilians are being revealed following the pullback of Russian troops from the greater Kyiv area. In Bucha, northwest of the capital, images show civilian bodies strewn across a road following the Russian withdrawal. CNN reporters observed a mass grave in the town, with the mayor saying up to 300 victims may be buried there. Though the footage left many lost for words, Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, reacted to the images. ""This is genocide,"" Zelensky said on Sunday. ""The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,"" he continued. The scenes have drawn international outrage, with Western leaders calling for war crimes investigations and increasing sanctions on Russia. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the extensive footage was ""fake,"" saying ""not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions"" during Russia's occupation of Bucha. US State Department spokesman Ned Price hinted at additional US action against Russia coming ""very soon"" when asked about Zelensky's request for greater G7 sanctions in response to the latest atrocities. HRW documents allege war crimes by Russian forces Rape, summary executions and unlawful violence are some of the war crimes allegedly perpetrated by Russian forces against civilians in the occupied areas of Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv regions of Ukraine, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The independent rights group said in a statement Sunday that it has documented allegations of war crimes, which ""include a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022."" ""Soldiers were also implicated in looting civilian property, including food, clothing and firewood. Those who carried out these abuses are responsible for war crimes,"" it added. CNN has not independently verified the details of those reports, and has requested comment from the Russian Ministry of Defense regarding the allegations. ""The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,"" Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe and Central Asia director, said in the statement. ""Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces' custody should be investigated as war crimes."" Odesa under attack The southern coastal city of Odesa came under attack Sunday, with a local official saying a Russian missile strike had hit ""critical infrastructure."" A fuel depot in the city was still burning Monday morning, according to a CNN team on the scene, with one witness telling CNN they heard six explosions at the fuel depot before sunrise. The coastal city has been a place of relative calm during the Russian invasion and a haven for displaced Ukrainians from areas that have seen the worst fighting. But Odesa has been bracing for a Russian attack for weeks, with the city center full of anti-tank barricades. ""Odesa was attacked from the air. Some of the missiles were downed by our air defense system. In some districts fire has broken out,"" the Odesa City Council posted on its official Telegram account. Russia ramps up attacks in eastern Ukraine In the light of fierce Ukrainian resistance, US intelligence suggests Russia has revised its invasion strategy to focus on taking control of the Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine, with a target date of early May. Serhiy Haidai, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said Monday that the Russian military had been gathering a ""significant accumulation of troops and military equipment"" in the region, in apparent preparation for an offensive push. ""Yes, I can confirm, that there is a significant accumulation of troops and military equipment that is getting prepared for the major breakthrough (in Luhansk region),"" he said, speaking on national television. ""There was an attempt of a breakthrough in Rubizhne this night, our defenders repelled an attack. We are holding out, but we do see there's a major accumulation of troops."" Leaders in the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics previously announced a ""full mobilization"" in the territories under their control. Haidai said the mobilization was underway, but added that the new recruits were inexperienced and were ""being used as cannon fodder."" The Russian military has said it is pulling back its forces from around Kyiv and the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv to concentrate efforts in the Donbas region. Two Russia-friendly European leaders set to win re-election Hungary's authoritarian leader and longtime Russian ally, Viktor Orban, declared victory in the country's parliamentary elections, clinching a fourth consecutive term in power. Orban's Fidesz party had a commanding lead with 71% of the votes counted, the national elections board said on Sunday evening. The election campaign was dominated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which put Orban's lengthy association with Russian President Vladimir Putin under scrutiny. In his victory speech, Orban called Zelensky one of the ""opponents"" he had to overcome during the campaign. Hungary is heavily reliant on Russian energy and Orban has dodged opportunities to condemn Putin's assault on its neighboring state, complicating efforts by the European Union (EU) to present a united front against him. Meanwhile, Serbia's incumbent President, Aleksandar Vucic, is set to win Sunday's presidential election with 59.8% of the votes, according to a projection by pollsters Ipsos and CeSID, Reuters reports. The projection is based on a sample of the partial polling station count. Vucic ran for a second five-year term on a promise of peace and stability just as Russia invaded Ukraine. This has put Serbia under pressure from the West to choose between its traditional ties with Moscow and aspirations to join the EU. Vucic acknowledged conflict in Ukraine affected the campaign and said Serbia has no plans to deviate from its balancing game between the EU membership bid and close ties with Russia and China, a major investor. ""We will maintain policy that is important for the Europeans, Russians and Americans, and that is ... military neutrality,"" Reuters reported Vucic as saying. ""Serbia will try to preserve friendly and partnership relations in many areas with the Russian Federation,"" he added. Serbia is almost entirely dependent on Russian gas, and its army maintains ties with Russia's military. Although Serbia backed two UN resolutions condemning the invasion of Ukraine, it refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, according to Reuters.",45,3.838113408682131,3.1790017373071184,0.6591116713750127,3
2022-04-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/europe/bucha-ukraine-civilian-deaths-intl/index.html,Bodies of 'executed people' strewn across street in Bucha as Ukraine accuses Russia of war crimes,"The lifeless bodies of at least 20 civilian men line a single street in the town of Bucha near the Ukrainian capital. Some lie face down on the pavement while others are collapsed on their backs, mouths open in a tragic testament to the horrors of Russian occupation. The hands of one man are tied behind his back with a piece of white cloth. Another man lies alone, tangled up in a bicycle by a grassy bank. A third man lies in the middle of the road, near the charred remains of a burned-out car. The shocking images of the carnage in Bucha were captured by Agence France-Presse on Saturday, the same day Ukraine declared the town liberated from Russian troops. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital. The town of Bucha has endured five weeks of near-constant firefights. Now officials and human rights groups are blaming the civilian deaths on the departed Russian forces. ""Corpses of executed people still line the Yabluska street in Bucha. Their hands are tied behind their backs with white 'civilian' rags, they were shot in the back of their heads. So you can imagine what kind of lawlessness they perpetrated here,"" Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk told Reuters on Saturday. In a video address Sunday after the reports out of Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for an end of Russian ""war crimes."" ""The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth,"" he said. Zelensky called on Russian leaders to be held accountable for the actions of the nation's military. ""I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image,"" Zelensky said. The alleged atrocities in Bucha have drawn international outrage, with Western leaders, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, calling for war crimes investigations and increasing sanctions on Russia. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths. In his address, Zelensky announced a ""mechanism of justice"" would be established to investigate crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukrainian territory. The mechanism would be supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Prosecutor General's Office, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other government branches, he said. ""This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said. Zelensky said he will provide more information on the state of Ukrainian territory that was occupied by Russian forces. ""All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the (United Nations) Security Council on Tuesday,"" he said. He also noted that efforts are underway to restore electricity and water to Bucha, as well as reestablishing medical institutions and infrastructure. Zelensky once again invoked the need for stronger sanctions against Russia. ""There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land,"" he said. Asked during an appearance earlier Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" if Russia was carrying out genocide in his country, Zelensky said: ""Indeed. This is genocide."" ""The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,"" he said. The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed the extensive footage of Bucha was ""fake,"" saying ""not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions"" during Russia's occupation of the city. ""In the settlements of the Kiev region, Russian military personnel delivered and issued 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians,"" it said in a statement. A separate statement claimed the footage was staged. ""Stories about Bucha appeared in several foreign media outlets at once, which looks like a planned media campaign,"" the statement said. ""Taking into account that the troops left the city on March 30, where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake."" The Russian government has consistently responded to allegations of civilian casualties inflicted by Russian forces with blanket denials. After the Russian air force bombed a maternity hospital on March 9, Russian officials attempted to cast doubt on widespread media reports, with one Russian diplomat accusing a victim of the bombing -- a woman who escaped from the bombing, bloodied and still pregnant -- of being an actor and not a real victim. Mass grave The toll of the Russian invasion was apparent at a mass grave in Bucha. People cried as they attempted to locate the bodies of lost loved ones at a grave located in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints on Sunday, according to a CNN team at the scene. Bucha residents told CNN that bodies were first buried in the grave in the first few days of the war. They believe 150 people are buried in the site, many of whom were civilians killed in the fighting around Bucha. CNN saw at least a dozen bodies in body bags piled inside the grave. Some were already partially covered. The mayor of Bucha said in public remarks Saturday that up to 300 victims could be buried at the site. CNN was unable to independently verify those numbers or the identities and nationalities of those buried in the grave. The earth on the church grounds appeared to have been recently moved so it is feasible that more bodies could be buried there. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Sunday that reports emerging from towns in the Kyiv region revealed a ""post-apocalyptic picture"" of life under Russian occupation. ""This is a special appeal aimed at drawing the world's attention to those war crimes, crimes against humanity, which were committed by Russian troops in Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel,"" Arestovych said. ""These are liberated cities, a picture from horror movies, a post-apocalyptic picture."" ""Victims of these war crimes have already been found, including raped women who they tried to burn, local government officials killed, children killed, elderly people killed, men killed, many of them with tied hands, traces of torture and shot in the back of the head. Robberies, attempts to take gold, valuables, carpets, washing machines. It, of course, will be taken into account by the Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine and law enforcement agencies and international criminal courts."" The evidence of apparent atrocities in Bucha came as Human Rights Watch (HRW) announced it had documented allegations of war crimes in the occupied areas of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Kharkiv regions. HRW said Sunday that the allegations include ""a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022."" In Bucha, Russian forces ""rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them"" on March 4, HRW wrote. A witness told the group that soldiers forced the men to kneel on the road and pulled their shirts over their heads, before shooting one of the men in the back of the head. HRW also alleges that on February 27, six men were rounded up in the village of Staryi Bykiv in the Chernihiv region and later executed. In Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region, a Russian soldier repeatedly raped a woman in a school where she was sheltering with her family on March 13, the victim told HRW. ""She said that he beat her and cut her face, neck, and hair with a knife,"" HRW wrote. The woman fled to Kharkiv the following day, ""where she was able to get medical treatment and other services."" And in the village of Vorzel, 31 miles northwest of Kyiv, Russian soldiers ""threw a smoke grenade into a basement, then shot a woman and a 14-year-old child as they emerged from the basement, where they had been sheltering,"" HRW said. ""The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,"" Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe and Central Asia director, said in the statement. ""Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces' custody should be investigated as war crimes."" CNN has not independently verified the details of the HRW report and has requested comment from the Russian defense ministry. Sunday's developments in Ukraine have hastened calls for war crimes investigations. Blinken said the State Department would help document any atrocities the Russian military committed against Ukrainian civilians. ""You can't help but see these images as a punch to the gut,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" Sunday, when asked about the civilian killings in Bucha. ""Since the aggression, we've come out and said that we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes, and we've been working to document that, to provide the information we have to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together. And there needs to be accountability for it."" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement Sunday that ""indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians during Russia's illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes."" European Union Council President Charles Michel vowed further sanctions on Russia, while United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said an ""independent investigation"" into the civilians killed in Bucha was ""essential.""",45,3.7847540109800235,4.051231314015629,-0.2664773030356056,3
2022-04-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/02/politics/russia-shifting-focus-victory-eastern-ukraine/index.html,"Russia shifting focus to show a victory by early May in eastern Ukraine, US officials say","Russia has revised its Ukraine war strategy to focus on trying to take control of the Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine with a target date of early May, according to several US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments. More than a month into the war, Russian ground forces have been unable to keep control of areas where they have been fighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin is under pressure to demonstrate he can show a victory, and eastern Ukraine is the place where he is most likely to be able to quickly do that, officials say. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin is focused on May 9, Russia's ""Victory Day,"" according to one of the officials. May 9 is a prominent holiday on the Russian calendar, a day the country marks the Nazi surrender in World War II with a huge parade of troops and weaponry across Red Square in front of the Kremlin. The officials say Putin wants to be able to celebrate a victory -- of some kind -- in his war on that day. But other officials note even if there is a Russian celebration, an actual victory may be further off. ""Putin will have a victory parade on 9th May regardless the status of the war or peace talks,"" a European defense official said. ""On the other hand: a victory parade with what troops and vehicles?"" Still, US and European officials say that any deadlines Moscow may set rhetorically don't change the reality on the ground that Russia appears to be preparing for the prospect of an extended conflict in Ukraine. A European diplomat said that while the Kremlin is talking optimistically, Putin is preparing for a ""Chechnya-style long, drawn-out war, because he, to a certain extent, has nowhere else to go on this."" There are several reasons behind the May time frame, the officials say. As the winter freeze ends and the ground softens, it will be harder for heavy Russian ground units to maneuver, meaning that it's vital for those forces to get into place as soon as possible, US intelligence assesses. Russian-backed fighters have also already been in that region for years. In 2014, Russian separatist forces took control of territory within the the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Putin announced he was recognizing two self-declared independent republics in the Donbas region. Ukrainian officials have publicly pointed to the date as well. ""Ahead of May 9, Putin set the goal of a victory parade for this war,"" Ukrainian Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Thursday. Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday that the Ukrainians believe they are facing a ""very complex and difficult"" situation as Putin tries meet a deadline. ""His ultimate goal is, was and will be to take over Ukraine, but he failed. He failed due to a very strong resolve of Ukrainian military and very strong unity of Ukraine and the Western world, and the sanctions that have been imposed by the United States and G7 and the European Union,"" Yatsenyuk said. ""So now, as far as I see, Putin switched to Plan B. My take is that this Plan B has a, kind of, deadline. The deadline is the ninth of May."" The US also assesses that Putin is now preparing for the first time to name an overall commander of the war to try to achieve greater Russian successes, two of the US officials said. The US belief is Putin will likely name a general who has been in the south because that is a place where the Russians have succeeded in their objectives. CNN previously reported there was no theater-wide commander on the ground in or near Ukraine, and units from different Russian military districts operating in different parts of Ukraine appear to be competing for resources rather than coordinating their efforts, according to two US defense officials. One of the signs the Russians are regrouping is that their troops pulling out of fighting areas north and east of Kyiv appear to have moved north, in some cases into Belarus, for resupply. The US believes this will put them in position to move southeast into the Donbas region. One Russian battlefield goal in Donbas would be to cut off Ukraine troops already there so they cannot fall back to defensive positions or link up with other Ukrainian forces, officials say. But a shift in the battlefield to the east on the ground may do little to stop the ongoing Russian air assaults by long-range missiles and aircraft throughout the rest of Ukraine, especially in the south.",7,5.462563221396782,4.026483270780373,1.436079950616409,9

Asked Sunday whether Russian troops were committing genocide, Blinken said, ""We will look hard and document everything that we see, put it all together, make sure that the relevant institutions and organizations that are looking at this, including the State Department, have everything they need to assess exactly what took place in Ukraine, who's responsible and what it amounts to."" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was also asked later Sunday by Bash if the Russian actions in Ukraine constituted genocide, but he opted to call it ""a brutality against civilians we haven't seen in Europe for decades."" Those remarks contrasted with those of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said Sunday after images emerged of civilian bodies strewn across the streets in the town of Bucha: ""Indeed. This is genocide."" ""The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,"" Zelensky told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths. CNN has requested comment from the Russian defense ministry regarding allegations of the execution of civilians in the Kyiv region and other parts of Ukraine. Also Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for further action against Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, telling NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that ""now is the time to double down on the pressure."" ""I think we are really looking at this with our eyes wide open and seeing very clearly the threat he poses, not just to Ukraine, as we can watch every night on our news, but really to Europe, to democracy and the global stability we thought we were building in the last 20 years,"" Clinton said. Blinken on Sunday declined to confirm reporting from CNN and others that the US was helping facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine, which was one of the weapons systems Zelensky has been seeking. But Blinken said the US and NATO countries were helping to get Ukraine the weapons it needed, adding there would soon be 10 anti-tank weapons systems in the county for every one Russian tank that's in Ukrainian territory. ""Across the board, what we're trying to do is make sure the Ukrainians have the systems they need that they can use and they can use right away,"" Blinken said. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Fox on Sunday that he supports sending the Ukrainians ""anything that they can use and as fast as we can get it there."" ""We can't dither and worry about some of the niceties here when the Ukrainians are fighting for their very lives, and if they feel like they need to take out a fuel depot across Russian border, go for it,"" he added, referring to an alleged strike on a Russian fuel depot late last week. Russia has accused Ukrainian helicopters of striking the fuel depot in Belgorod. CNN could not verify the Russian claims, and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has neither confirmed nor denied the attack. Asked about the prospect of Ukraine maintaining neutrality between the West and Russia as part of a negotiated end to the war, Blinken said the Biden administration would support what the Ukrainians want to maintain their sovereignty. ""When it comes to the future, we and allies and partners are going to want to make sure to do everything we can to ensure that this can't happen again and that Ukraine has the means to defend itself, to deter further Russian aggression,"" he said. ""So we will look at anything we can do (to) back up that kind of outcome.""

2022-04-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/02/europe/russia-ukraine-heavier-weaponry-military-focus-intl/index.html,Ukrainian presidential adviser calls for heavier weaponry as Russia shifts military focus,"As the Russian military shifts its campaign to focus on the east and south of Ukraine, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has called on the US and its allies to deliver heavier weaponry to the ex-Soviet nation. ""After the rapid retreat of the Russians from Kyiv and Chernihiv, it is clear that Russia has prioritized another tactic -- to move east/south, to control large occupied territories (not only in Donetsk and Luhansk regions) and to gain a strong foothold there,"" Podolyak said on Saturday. ""They have established in the east and south and are dictating harsh conditions,"" added Podolyak. ""So we definitely can't do without heavy weapons if we want to unblock the east and Kherson and send [back] the Russians as far as possible."" Last month the Russian military said the ""first stage"" of its invasion of Ukraine was complete and that it would withdraw forces from around Kyiv and Chernihiv to concentrate on the Donbas region in the country's east. Russia's announcement of that new phase in part may provide political cover for the Russian military, explaining heavy setbacks in the battles around Kyiv, but Ukrainian officials have also reported a ramping up of military activity and shelling in the Donbas by Russian forces. Podolyak alluded to an expectation from US and Western officials that Ukraine might need to prepare for further partisan warfare -- and referred to the Kremlin's bloody nine-year campaign to support the Marxist government in Kabul. ""Our partners must finally understand that the 'Afghanization' they want and the long-lasting exhausting conflict for Russia will not happen,"" he said. The war, which began when Soviet forces invaded in 1979, claimed nearly a million Afghan lives and 15,000 Russian troops, with a further 50,000 wounded. ""'Afghanization' is when there is a strong guerrilla resistance across the country that inflicts heavy losses on the aggressor for many months or even years and thus significantly weakens the power of the occupier's army,"" explained Podolyak. ""Such actions took place during the Soviet Union's attempt to control Afghanistan: Afghan guerrillas destroyed and weakened the Soviet occupiers for years. As a result, weakened Russia as a whole."" ""Russia will leave all Ukrainian territories except the south and east. And will try to dig in there, put in air defense and sharply reduce the loss of its equipment and personnel,"" Podolyak added. The US is expected to help facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine, a source familiar with the plan told CNN on Saturday. Officials have declined to say how many tanks will ultimately go to Ukraine. They will be Soviet-era T-72 tanks, which Ukrainian military personnel have experience operating, a senior US official told CNN. Those tanks will be delivered ""within days, not weeks,"" the official said, from NATO partner countries. The New York Times first reported on the transfer. The Ukrainian presidential adviser's comments came hours after the Russian ambassador to the United Kingdom, Andrei Kelin, said that if Britain delivers long-range artillery weapons and anti-ship systems to Ukraine, they would be ""legitimate targets"" for Russia. ""Any weapon deliveries are destabilizing, especially the ones mentioned by (Ben) Wallace (the British Defense Secretary),"" said Kelin, according to Russian state news agency TASS. ""They exacerbate the situation and make it bloodier."" ""Apparently, these are new, rather high-precision weapons. Of course, they will be legitimate targets for our armed forces if they cross the border of Ukraine."" ""I have a feeling that London's idea of what is happening in Ukraine militarily is formed on the basis of the bravado reports of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and the Ukrainian leadership,"" Kelin said. Russian officials have long complained about deliveries of advanced military weapons to Ukraine by the US, the UK, and other NATO allies, who have provided anti-tank weapons and man-portable air defenses -- some of which have enabled Ukrainian troops to blunt Russian advances.",7,3.464417737425111,4.869468203999678,-1.4050504665745671,13
2022-04-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/01/politics/western-spy-agencies-intelligence-putin-ukraine-war/index.html,Western spy agencies weaponize intelligence in attempt to undermine Putin,"Western intelligence agencies are waging a psychological war over Ukraine directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, an expert at the genre, who is now effectively taking a dose of his own medicine. The United States and its allies are painting a picture of a bogged down, demoralized and dysfunctional Russian military taking disastrous losses on the battlefield, and are simultaneously conjuring a vision of growing political tension inside the Kremlin. They claim the Russian leader is isolated, poorly advised and lacking real intelligence on just how badly the war is going. Western governments are preventing Putin from defining the narrative of the war -- just as they did before it began, when their declassified intelligence correctly called an invasion many geopolitical experts thought was unlikely. It is a tough position for a Russian leader who has often deployed information warfare himself, notably while meddling in US and European elections. The remarkable detail of the declassified intelligence assessments must also be especially galling to Putin, a former KGB officer and intelligence chief. And they leave open the possibility that Western intelligence agencies have the capacity to see deep into the Kremlin's war effort and internal politics, which is likely to infuriate the Russian leader and could open further cracks in his regime. The willingness of Western governments to be so open about what they are seeing inside Ukraine and Moscow has surprised even some veteran spies. ""It makes intelligence professionals, even former ones like me, nervous, because, of course, it's so ingrained in us to protect sources and methods,"" Steve Hall, former chief of Russia operations for the CIA, told CNN's Ana Cabrera Thursday. Part of the intrigue about the US showdown with Putin and the intelligence angle is being fed by the nature of the covert community itself. Outsiders have no way of independently assessing the full accuracy of the information being pushed into the public view by their leaders. So we don't know where it's all coming from or from whom. But of course, that's the point, and it's keeping the Russians guessing too. The attempt to portray the war in Ukraine as a disaster for Russia is coming at a moment when Western officials are discounting Moscow's claims that it is deescalating the conflict in Kyiv and elsewhere. Instead, they say, Putin's forces are ""repositioning"" -- possibly for an intensified assault in eastern Ukrainian regions where Moscow has been pummeling civilians and razing cities. Such a tactic could be designed to unite Russian-held areas with Crimea, which Putin seized in 2014, and to give Moscow a direct corridor to the Black Sea through Ukraine. The inside story of the war In recent days, Western officials have sketched a remarkable portrait of the war. In Australia on Monday, one of Britain's top spy chiefs, Jeremy Fleming, said that Putin had ""massively misjudged"" the war, the resistance of the Ukrainian people and his own military's capacity, and had been poorly served by his subordinates. ""We've seen Russian soldiers -- short of weapons and morale -- refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,"" said Fleming, who heads GCHQ, the UK's equivalent of the National Security Agency. Fleming's frankness was extraordinary coming from a leading espionage agency chief. But it is being mirrored in the United States where there were new reports on Wednesday that opened a window into the war and Putin's inner circle. An official told CNN's Jeremy Diamond that Putin is being ""misinformed"" by advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and the impact of sanctions on the Russian economy. \White House communications director Kate Bedingfield then said on camera that the Russian leader's advisers were ""too afraid to tell him the truth."" She said there was now a ""persistent tension"" between Putin and his military leadership. On Wednesday, this new stream of declassified assessments made headlines. On Thursday, President Joe Biden was asked about them in a public setting, as officials presumably knew he would be. The sequence gave the President the chance to further amplify the US narrative. ""There's a lot of speculation,"" Biden said, though of course that speculation had been driven by information that the White House had allowed into the public domain. Asked how badly Putin was being misinformed by his advisers, Biden replied, ""I'm not saying this with a certainty -- he seems to be self-isolating, and there's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers."" While Biden said that the US didn't have that much hard evidence, his comments unleashed a whole new torrent of attention on Putin's current situation. So what exactly are Western governments trying to do with this novel use of declassified intelligence assessments? Especially given that in many previous geopolitical crises, intelligence was kept secret by routine? As with the pre-invasion messaging, it's clear that the US does not want the Russians to be able to create a dominant narrative of their own about the war through disinformation. Creating a picture of a failing war also helps maintain support for the tough Western stand against Putin. It may also improve morale among Ukrainians who are resisting Russia's onslaught. And it gives Western leaders a political opening to argue their policies are working as they manage public opinion on the war. By providing a look into the disarray among Russian troops, the allies may be able to build internal political pressure on the Kremlin. Given the Moscow government's crushing of independent media, there will be few illusions that the Russian people will hear the US version of events, though tech-savvy younger Russians with VPN passwords allowing access to foreign internet services might. But a drumbeat of humiliation for Russia could further sow discord inside the military, political and intelligence elites. In recent days, it has almost seemed as though Western officials, by discussing the situation in the war so openly, have been trying to address Putin and his advisers directly. The complications of an intelligence-driven strategy It's unlikely the intelligence stream will dry up any time soon. That's because it seems to be rooted in a morale problem inside Russian armed forces, which became obvious thanks to eavesdropping. ""They're whipping out their cell phones and trying to communicate with each other, both tactically, 'Where are you? Where's your unit?' and perhaps also back home in Moscow. That makes it really easy to collect,"" Hall said. ""And then, it's an interesting political decision to say, look, it's worth perhaps showing the Russians how good we are at collecting this stuff, in order to get the word out to citizens of both countries, citizens of the world, as to what's really going on in the Russian military right now,"" Hall added. ""It's an interesting decision, but it's been very illuminating."" Still there is reason for caution in interpreting the war solely based on the West's declassified assessments. Intelligence, by definition, is a murky business. The information about the Russian operations in Ukraine and the apparent isolation of Putin in Moscow only tell the outside world what the Western intelligence services want to release. There is, therefore, no way for outsiders to know whether these snapshots give the full picture or a more selective one. And the information that does filter out is still limited. An official cited by CNN's Diamond and Kevin Liptak on Wednesday declined to provide additional details of Putin being misinformed by his advisers other than what was reported. The intelligence community declassified and downgraded a summary of their findings but not the material itself. As always, intelligence agencies are taking strenuous steps to avoid identifying their sources and the methods that were used to collect the intelligence. There have been multiple times in recent American history -- for example, before the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, when US intelligence assessments have proven to be faulty. In this crisis, however, the covert community has repaired some of its reputation. For weeks, the US warned that Putin was getting ready to send his forces across the Ukrainian border. Even the Ukrainians were skeptical. Then hours before the invasion actually happened, the US issued a warning that the incursion was imminent -- and was proven correct. Still, the problems encountered by the Russian invading force have surprised Western intelligence agencies and have caused a reassessment of assumptions about the supposed might of Russia's military forces and leadership. The head of US European Command, Gen. Tod Wolters, said at a Senate hearing this week that there could be an intelligence gap that led the US to overestimate Russia's strength and underestimate Ukrainian defenses. But even that oversight only underscores the surprisingly poor performance of Russia's forces, and draws attention to it, further advancing the West's goals.",20,3.7331643672735266,3.9656781382018407,-0.23251377092831405,22
2022-03-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-hack-russian-ransomware-gang/index.html,'I can fight with a keyboard': How one Ukrainian IT specialist exposed a notorious Russian ransomware gang,"As Russian artillery began raining down on his homeland last month, one Ukrainian computer researcher decided to fight back the best way he knew how -- by sabotaging one of the most formidable ransomware gangs in Russia. Four days into Russia's invasion, the researcher began publishing the biggest leak ever of files and data from Conti, a syndicate of Russian and Eastern Europe cybercriminals wanted by the FBI for conducting attacks on hundreds of US organizations and causing millions of dollars in losses. The thousands of internal documents and communications include evidence that appears to suggest Conti operatives have contacts within the Russian government, including the FSB intelligence service. That supports a longstanding US allegation that Moscow has colluded with cybercriminals for strategic advantage. The Ukrainian computer specialist behind the leak spoke exclusively to CNN and described his motivation for seeking revenge after Conti operatives published a statement in support of the Russian government immediately after the invasion of Ukraine. He also described his desperate efforts to track down loved ones in Ukraine in recent weeks. To protect his identity, CNN agreed to refer to him by a pseudonym: Danylo. ""I cannot shoot anything, but I can fight with a keyboard and mouse,"" Danylo told CNN. The trove of data Danylo leaked in late February illustrates why cybersecurity has been such a fraught issue in US-Russia relations. It includes cryptocurrency accounts the Conti hackers used to allegedly reap millions of dollars in ransom payments, their discussions of how to extort US companies and their apparent targeting of a journalist investigating the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny. But it also shows how hard it can be to disable ransomware operations. Despite Danylo unmasking their operations, the hackers continue to announce new victim organizations. Danylo, who has worked as a cybersecurity researcher for years and studied the underground cybercriminal economy in Europe, is just one vigilante in a shadow war that has emerged between hackers and cybersecurity executives who have pledged support for the Ukrainian and Russian governments as the biggest land war in Europe since World War II drags on. But by disrupting a group as notorious as Conti, Danylo has gained more attention than others. The FBI, Danylo said, contacted him after he began to leak the Conti files, asking him to stop leaking. The FBI declined to comment. CNN corroborated Danylo's claim that he was the leaker by reviewing evidence that he had access to the Twitter account that was publishing the Conti data, as well as a website that Danylo and another person, who was granted anonymity for their protection, were using to share data contained in the leaks. Danylo hasn't spoken with the media about his motives -- until now. He did so while navigating a war-ravaged country he had only recently returned to and could hardly recognize. ""It's my country,"" he said in a phone interview. ""If they [the Ukrainian government] provide me weapons, OK, I'll go fight. But I'm better at typing."" Digital retribution Danylo claims that he first gained access to computer systems used by what would become the Conti syndicate in 2016. Though he declined to explain in detail how he did this, independent security experts have verified to CNN the dataset belongs to the hackers. (Conti is both the name of malicious software and the cybercriminal syndicate that uses it. The group is also affiliated with TrickBot, another hacking tool used in numerous ransomware attacks.) ""Sometimes they make mistakes,"" Danylo said, referring to ransomware groups. ""You need to catch them when they make a mistake. I just was in the right place at the right time. I was monitoring them."" For years, Danylo said, he quietly lurked on the hackers' computer servers and would pass along information on the group's operations to European law enforcement officials. Conti ransomware has been rampant in the last two years, with the hackers claiming numerous victims a week. In September 2020, the hackers claimed to have stolen case files from a district court in Louisiana. In March 2021, Conti ransomware was used in a hack that hobbled the computer networks of Ireland's $25 billion public health system, disrupting a maternity ward in Dublin. The dark work was lucrative: hackers using the Conti ransomware received at least $25.5 million in ransom payments in the span of just four months in 2021, according to Elliptic, a firm that tracks cryptocurrency transactions. But something snapped in Danylo on February 25, 2022, when Conti operatives published a statement pledging their ""full support"" for the Russian government as it attacked Ukraine. A Russian airstrike had landed not far from a family member's house. The cybersecurity researcher grew up in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union. He didn't want to see it slip back into Russian hands. Conti members tried to walk their statement back, claiming they weren't supporting any government, but Danylo had heard enough. Asked again why he dumped the Conti data, Danylo said with a laugh: ""To prove that they are motherf**kers."" He was exhausted from a long day navigating military checkpoints in Ukraine, on the hunt for cigarettes and looking to the sky for signs of the next air raid. Contacted by the FBI Conti is exactly the type of prolific ransomware group that President Joe Biden last year exhorted Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring to heel amid a spate of attacks on US critical infrastructure. The Kremlin appeared to dangle the prospect of collaborating with the US to combat cybercrime this January, when the Russian FSB intelligence agency announced the arrest of multiple accused cybercriminals. But the chances of bilateral cooperation on cybercrime have dimmed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has killed more than 1,000 civilians, according to the United Nations, and made Putin an international pariah. After he started leaking the data, Danylo said, an FBI special agent contacted him and asked him to stop. Exposing Conti infrastructure could, in theory, make it more difficult for the FBI to track the group because it might set up new computer systems. Danylo has stopped leaking for now. But he says he still has access to some Conti computer systems. At least one law enforcement official who spoke to CNN would have preferred that Danylo had maintained that covert access, rather than alert the ransomware syndicate to his presence by leaking the data. ""Publicly releasing information like [the leaker did] is reckless,"" a US law enforcement official told CNN. ""Working cooperatively with law enforcement can achieve a more substantial and lasting impact in disrupting the operations of groups like Conti."" But John Fokker, a former cybercrime investigator with the Dutch police, said the leak could actually be useful to cops chasing cyber crooks. ""Yes, infrastructure can be burned. However, the amount of data provided in the leaks make me confident that law enforcement got the information they need to write indictments on key individuals,"" said Fokker, who works closely with European law enforcement as head of cyber investigations at security firm Trellix. A catalog of misdeeds The Conti leaks are a startling catalog of the alleged misdeeds of a multimillion-dollar criminal enterprise. CNN evaluated and translated the original cache of documents that Danylo shared with the world via Twitter. The communications show Conti members, each going by aliases in the chat logs, discussing the wisdom of extorting US small businesses, seemingly refraining from hacking Russian targets, and taking an interest in a journalist writing about Navalny, the Russian opposition figure who has been jailed and poisoned. In April 2021, Conti members ""mango"" and ""johnyboy77"" discussed plans to access files belonging to a journalist for investigative outlet Bellingcat, which had published a joint investigation with CNN in December 2020 on the alleged role of the Russia's FSB intelligence agency in the poisoning of Navalny. ""Bro, don't forget about Navalny, I flagged it to the boss -- he's waiting for details,"" mango wrote to johnyboy77 in Russian. It's unclear who ""the boss"" is in this exchange. But Christo Grozev, Bellingcat's lead Russian investigator, tweeted that the leaked chat corroborated an anonymous tip that Bellingcat received stating that a ""'global cyber crime group acting on an FSB order has hacked one of your contributors.'"" Conti operatives refer in their chats to Liteyny Avenue in St. Petersburg, which happens to be home to local FSB offices, according to Kimberly Goody, director of cyber crime analysis at security firm Mandiant. ""Generally speaking, it would be relatively unsurprising to learn that an operation as extensive as this would not in some way be leveraged as an asset [by the Russian government] at a point in time,"" Goody told CNN. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The Russian government has long denied accusations that it turns a blind eye to cybercrime. There also appears to be a correlation between the Conti leaks and public warnings from US cybersecurity officials, suggesting that federal authorities have been closely watching the group. On October 26, 2020, as US hospitals continued to reel from coronavirus cases, a Conti member with the alias Troy wrote to another member in Russian: ""F**k clinics in the USA this week ... There will be panic. 428 hospitals."" Two days later the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a dire warning about ransomware attacks on hospitals, many of which used a piece of malicious software that the leaked documents tie to Conti operatives. It was unclear what specific intelligence prompted the federal warning about the hospitals, but the timing was striking. 'It's my work' Cyberattacks have played a supporting role in the war in Ukraine. The White House has accused the Russian GRU military intelligence agency of knocking key Ukrainian government websites offline prior to the invasion. (A charge the Kremlin denies.) US officials are also investigating a hack of a satellite network serving parts of Ukraine, which occurred as the Russian invasion began, as a potential Russian state-sponsored hack, CNN previously reported. For its part, the Ukrainian government has encouraged an ""IT army"" of volunteer hackers in Ukraine and abroad to conduct cyberattacks on Russian organizations. In the free-for-all that is Ukrainian cyberspace, combatants like Danylo engage on their own terms. Asked how he's been in recent days, Danylo's replies have been consistent: ""Still alive."" Seeing houses and schools turn to rubble has drained the vigor from his voice. Danylo recalled, in the early days",20,6.0234271629191,6.282933975072793,-0.25950681215369276,2
2022-03-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-parliament-russia-skepticism/index.html,Ukrainian members of parliament say Russia peace talks are not real,"A delegation of Ukrainian lawmakers visiting Washington, DC, on Wednesday said they believe Russia is just using peace talks with Ukraine as a ""smokescreen"" for their forces to regroup and re-strategize in Ukraine. ""At this particular moment, these peace negotiations are far from real negotiations,"" Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, who chairs Ukraine's Parliamentary Committee on Integration of Ukraine to the European Union, told a small group of reporters at a roundtable hosted by the German Marshall Fund think tank. ""Definitely, I think that Putin is using this as a smokescreen, buying time to regroup ... and sending false, lying messages to the whole world,"" she said. ""We feel these are not real peace talks at this point,"" said MP Anastasia Radina, who heads the parliament's Committee on Anti-Corruption Policy. ""We feel that what Russia is doing is trying to save face. They say they are withdrawing troops from Kiev region. That's not true for one simple reason. They're not withdrawing. ... They were kicked (out)."" Radina said there is only ""one way out of the war, and that is for Ukraine to win."" Their remarks came one day after the Russian Ministry of Defense said that it had decided to ""drastically reduce hostilities"" around Kyiv and Chernihiv. US officials, including President Joe Biden, remain skeptical of the announcement. ""We'll see,"" Biden said on Tuesday when asked about Russia's claims. ""I don't read anything into it until I see what their actions are. We'll see if they follow through on what they're suggesting."" More weapons needed Ukraine's military is seeking foreign assistance obtaining reconnaissance and attack drones, tactical radars, electronic warfare anti-drone systems and close-air support aircraft, according to Ukraine's most recent list of needs provided to Congress. The list delivered to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, which was obtained by CNN, also includes help treating wounded troops and repairing equipment, including mobile military medical hospitals, the repairs of armored vehicles in neighboring countries and aircraft to help transport weapons. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, said at a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday that latest the list provided to Congress this week reflected Ukrainian military and civilian leadership's ""urgent needs."" At the top of the priority list of 17 items was reconnaissance and attack drones, including ""switchblade"" drones, which are small so-called kamikaze or suicide drones that carry a warhead and detonate on impact. The list also included combat aircraft -- specifically referencing the Su-25, a Russian-made ground attack plane similar to the US-made A-10 Warthog. The Ukrainian military is also seeking artillery systems, surface-to-air missile systems, anti-tank Javelin missiles, anti-ship missiles and optical surveillance equipment. The all-female Ukrainian delegation -- men between the ages of 18-60 are not allowed to leave Ukraine amid the war -- traveled to Washington this week primarily, they say, to ask American lawmakers and administration officials for more military support, which they said is still falling far short of Ukraine's needs. ""Proper action for Ukraine right now, for support to Ukraine right now, would be weaponry,"" Radina said. ""Ukraine is constantly asking for weaponry and not only defensive weaponry, but also offensive weaponry. In our situation, this distinction between defensive and offensive is, frankly speaking, humiliating. In our situation, all weapons are defensive because we are defending our lands."" Radina reiterated that Ukraine needs fighter jets, ""because this is how we can actually stop bombings. ... And as of now this is the issue on the table, and while it is on the table, people will continue suffering."" ""Our 'humanitarian aid' is weapons,"" said MP Maria Ionova. ""Because to minimize these victims and casualties, we have to defend our air. Freedom has to be armed. And that is why our main message here is please, help us to defend our future and the future of the democratic world."" 'Neutrality is not an option for Ukraine' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signaled that Ukraine might be willing to forgo NATO membership and commit to neutrality if the West provides Ukraine with solid security guarantees. But such a move would have to be put to a referendum -- and Klympush-Tsintsadze indicated that anything short of NATO membership should be rejected. ""Neutrality is not an option for Ukraine,"" she said. ""I want everybody to understand we were non-aligned. We were a non-bloc country back in 2014. It did not preclude Putin from attacking us at that point. And it did not preclude him from grabbing part of our territory. So it will not stop him. Even if we write on all the papers, all over, that we are neutral. He just is not interested in us existing as such."" Radina echoed those comments, saying that ""absolute neutrality is not an option for Ukraine,"" because Russia will always border the country and aim to ""obliterate"" Ukraine from the map. ""So yes, we are looking for workable security guarantees and not just another Budapest Memorandum,"" she said. The UK, US, and Russia signed that memorandum -- which was supposed to prohibit those countries from using military force against Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- in exchange for them giving up their nuclear weapons. Zelensky told the Munich Security Conference last month that Ukraine ""has tried three times"" since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, ""to convene consultations with the guarantor states of the Budapest Memorandum. Three times without success.""",49,4.252808310463845,4.6402996922421895,-0.38749138177834475,8
2022-03-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/europe/ukraine-russia-bombardment-intl/index.html,Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities blunts hopes of swift breakthrough,"Hopes of an early breakthrough in war-ravaged Ukraine were fading Wednesday as Russian forces continued to pound the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv, a day after Moscow said it would ""drastically reduce"" its military assault there. Officials in Ukraine said there had been no reduction in hostilities overnight and the mayor of Chernihov told CNN of a ""colossal attack"" on his city Wednesday, despite apparent progress in talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul, Turkey, the day before. Images emerged showing the extent of destruction in the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, where whole city blocks appear to have been wiped out during weeks of bombardment. ""There was an air alarm throughout the country during the night. In fact, there were no areas without sirens. In the morning they were repeated,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said Wednesday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that there had been no breakthroughs after the negotiations in Istanbul, but that Russia welcomed Ukraine's written demands. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said the previous day that enough progress had been made in the talks to allow Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet. Kyiv and Irpin Despite those promising words, the situation in the capital, Kyiv, and surrounding areas remained tense on Wednesday. Military strikes continued on Tuesday evening around Kyiv and there were reports of rocket fire overnight. ""In Kyiv, several rockets were shot down over the capital,"" said Denysenko. There were also reports of fighting near the northwestern suburb of Irpin overnight, he said. ""So there is no need to say so far that the Russians are reducing the intensity of hostilities in Kyiv and Chernihiv directions,"" he said. ""We can say that, yes, indeed, certain units and equipment are moving to the territory of Belarus. But it seems to be more like rotation and licking of wounds than a real cessation of hostilities."" In a video message on Wednesday night, Zelensky said the ""alleged pullback"" of Russian troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv is not a retreat but a result of the work of the Ukrainian military. He added that Russian troops are concentrating in the Donbas region for new attacks, saying Ukrainians are ""ready for this."" US officials on Tuesday also voiced skepticism over Russia's claims. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby warned that Russian troop movement near Kyiv was likely ""a repositioning, not a real withdrawal"" and that the threat to Kyiv was not over. The full extent of the devastation in Irpin was revealed in new video taken Tuesday by a Ukrainian NGO and provided to CNN. Filmed after Ukrainian forces pushed Russian troops out of the city at the start of the week, the video shows the wooded suburb reduced to a wasteland, with scattered debris, splintered trees and destroyed buildings all around. Gunfire and bombing may have stopped for now in Irpin, but there is little sign of life. At least five bodies are seen in the video; it's unclear how and when they died. Not much can be heard in the video except for the sound of wind blowing through the few trees that remain standing, the clank of metal sheets, and the dull thud of a distant military strike. Chernihiv The northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, which lies about halfway between Kyiv and the Russian border, has endured intense shelling in recent weeks. There are few signs that the Russian assault on the city is over. Viacheslav Chaus, head of the Chernihiv regional administration, said the city was under fire from Russian airstrikes while shelling continued through the night. And in an interview with CNN's John Berman, the city's mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, hit out at Russia's claim that it planned to ""drastically reduce"" its military assault on Chernihiv and Kyiv, saying it was ""yet another confirmation that Russia always lies."" According to Atroshenko, Russian attacks on Chernihiv have actually increased since the claim was made Tuesday. ""They're saying reducing intensity, they actually have increased the intensity of strikes,"" he said. ""Today we have a colossal attack on the center of Chernihiv. Twenty-five people have been wounded and are now in hospitals. They're all civilians. So whenever Russia says something, this needs to be checked carefully."" In an interview posted on Telegram on Wednesday, Chaus similarly said the situation in the region had not changed despite claims by Russia. Russian troops had carried out strikes on the city of Nizhyn, he said, destroying ""civil infrastructure"" as well as ""libraries, shopping malls and many residential buildings,"" while in Chernihiv there is ""no electricity, no water, no heat and no gas."" Communications are down with ""no possibility to restore them,"" making it difficult to reach isolated villages, Chaus added. ""There are villages where Russian tanks are stationed. We know that there are our people there and the situation is the worst there, because we are not able to get there and bring either medicine or food."" Ukrainian troops are prepared and are fighting back against Russian troops in the Chernihiv region, he added. Mariupol Meanwhile, new satellite images from Maxar Technologies show that entire city blocks in central Mariupol have been obliterated -- a level of destruction not previously evident in the besieged Ukrainian city. With communications in and out of Mariupol non-existent, the images are the first visual update in the past few days that have not come from Russian propaganda. The images confirm what sensory satellite data from NASA had picked up: Dozens of explosions have taken place in and around Mariupol. The area just east of the bombed drama theater -- where authorities believe about 300 people died in a Russian attack -- is in ruins. In one satellite image, the roofs are either missing or have been significantly damaged on nearly every building. In eastern Mariupol, another residential area has sustained similar destruction. Every house surrounding two separate apartment complexes is destroyed. Another sprawling apartment complex in southeastern Mariupol, near the Azovstal iron and steel works factory, has been destroyed. CNN has previously confirmed that Russian troops and Chechen fighters have been active near that apartment complex. Another image from Maxar confirms an allegation by Ukraine's Azov Battalion -- a unit that began as an ultra-nationalist militia but has since integrated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces -- that the Red Cross warehouse in Mariupol was hit by military strikes. The satellite images also show survivors of the carnage. Outside the Metro supermarket in western Mariupol, hundreds of people are seen gathered in lines, waiting to enter the building. Its roof has holes from military strikes. Just northeast of the city, Russian military positions can been seen, including vehicles parked directly next to homes. Towed artillery positions are seen just northeast of those vehicles. Mariupol's mayor estimated that as many as 160,000 people remained in the city as of Monday.",47,4.984176215658136,4.567557368366243,0.41661884729189325,27
2022-03-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-cyberattack-viasat-satellite/index.html,US satellite operator says persistent cyberattack at beginning of Ukraine war affected tens of thousands of customers,"A multi-faceted cyberattack at the onset of Russia's war on Ukraine knocked out internet service for tens of thousands of satellite modems in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, the US-based telecommunications provider that owns the network said Wednesday. It's the most detailed public account yet of one of the most consequential hacks of the war. US officials are investigating the incident as a potential Russian state-sponsored cyberattack, CNN previously reported. The hackers not only flooded the satellite modems owned by Viasat, a California-based firm, with traffic to knock them offline, but also used ""destructive commands"" to overwrite key data on the modems, Viasat said in its report -- a sign of how intent the hackers were on disrupting service in Ukraine. The hack occurred February 24 as the Russian military began their onslaught against Ukraine. A top Ukrainian cyber official, Victor Zhora, on March 15 called the hack ""a really huge loss in communications in the very beginning of the war."" Reuters first reported on the Viasat findings Wednesday. Viasat has been working to respond to the hack in the weeks since. It has shipped nearly 30,000 modems to customers to get them back online, the firm said Wednesday. ""The nature of this and other ongoing attacks we routinely see are dynamic, and we're constantly updating our tools and mitigations to ensure that the network is stable and secure,"" a Viasat spokesperson told CNN. The US government is still investigating the hack. ""We do not have an attribution to share at this time and are looking at this closely,"" Saloni Sharma, spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in an email Wednesday. ""As we have already said, we are concerned about the apparent use of cyber operations to disrupt communications systems in Ukraine and across Europe and affect businesses and individuals' access to the Internet."" Viasat hired US cybersecurity firm Mandiant to investigate the incident. Mandiant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The hack affected residential modems on Viasat's KA-SAT satellite network, Viasat said Wednesday. ""This cyber-attack did not impact Viasat's directly managed mobility or government users on the KA-SAT satellite,"" the firm added. ""It isn't surprising that the effects of the attack were not limited to Viasat residential customers on Ukrainian territory,"" Brian Kime, a vice president at cybersecurity firm ZeroFox, told CNN. ""Collateral damage happens in all wars and, if this was directed by Putin's government and successfully targeted government and military customers of Viasat, there easily could have been a similar impact on non-Ukrainian customers, including NATO members."" The battle for communications during the war in Ukraine has made satellite owners and other telecommunications providers a prime target for hacking. Triolan, an internet service provider with customers in key Ukrainian cities, said March 10 that a cyberattack had disrupted service and blamed ""the enemy"" in an apparent reference to Russia. For their part, Ukrainian officials have encouraged volunteer hackers to hit Russian organizations involved in the war.",20,7.980707451868325,7.508369658462417,0.47233779340590765,2
2022-03-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/politics/tod-wolters-intelligence-gap-us-russia-ukraine/index.html,Top US general in Europe says there 'could be' an intelligence gap in US that caused US to overestimate Russia's capabilities,"The top US general in Europe said Tuesday there ""could be"" a gap in US intelligence gathering that caused the US to overestimate Russia's capability and underestimate Ukraine's defensive abilities before Russia attacked Ukraine. When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last month, US intelligence assessed that the country-wide assault could lead to Kyiv falling into Russian hands within days. But Russia's military has been bogged down around the capital as the war has entered its second month, beleaguered by sustainability and logistics problems, along with an unexpected stiff resistance from Ukrainian fighters. Testifying at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday, US European Command chief Gen. Tod Wolters was asked by Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, if there was an intelligence gap that caused the US to overestimate Russia's strength and underestimate the Ukrainian defenses. ""There could be,"" Wolters responded. ""As we've always done in the past, when this crisis is over with, we will accomplish a comprehensive after-action review in all domains and in all departments and find out where our weak areas were and make sure we can find ways to improve, and this could be one of those areas."" While US intelligence was spot on in predicting Russia was planning to invade Ukraine -- which the Biden administration aggressively released to turn global sentiment against the Kremlin -- the intelligence community did not assess the poor performance of the Russian military. In the opening hours of the war, US officials offered to help Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky flee the country as Russian troops moved toward Kyiv, fearing that he would be killed. Zelensky refused, asking instead for weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. The US and NATO allies have continued to help re-supply Ukraine's military with weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that have been used against Russian forces. While estimates vary widely, sources familiar with the estimates say thousands of Russian troops have been killed in the conflict. US officials say they have anecdotal evidence of morale problems in the Russian military. More than a month into the war, Russia said on Tuesday that it would ""drastically reduce"" its military assault on the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv after talks took place between representatives of the two nations on Tuesday. US officials told CNN it was a ""major"" strategy shift by Moscow, with Russian forces pulling back in some areas of the north and focusing on gains in the south and east. At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing earlier this month, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said that the US intelligence community assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was underestimating the likely resistance he would face from the Ukrainians ahead of the invasion."" ""I think we did well there,"" she said. ""We did not do as well in terms of predicting the military challenges that he has encountered with his own military."" Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that US intelligence assessments before the invasion were based on a number of factors, including that the Ukrainians were ""not as ready as I thought they should be."" ""Therefore, I questioned their will to fight. That was a bad assessment on my part, because they have fought bravely and honorably and are doing the right thing,"" he said. Asked by Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton about assessments on how long Kyiv would hold out or how long Ukraine could maintain its air defenses, Berrier said the intelligence community ""made some assumptions about (Putin's) assumptions, which proved to be very, very flawed."" ""His actual activity as he got into this fight turned his operation kind of on its head,"" Berrier said of Putin. ""And what we've seen is a devolvement, if you will, of the operations that he has going on now.""",7,4.8752078678786726,5.143817774736814,-0.2686099068581411,9

On Monday, the mayor of Mariupol said that evacuation corridors had come largely under the control of Russian forces, after weeks of bombardment left the city in pieces, killed an unknown number of civilians and forced hundreds of thousands of residents from their homes. ""Not everything is in our power,"" said Mayor Vadym Boichenko, in a live television interview. ""Unfortunately, we are in the hands of the occupiers today."" Boichenko called for a complete evacuation of the remaining population of Mariupol, which was home to more than 400,000 people before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24. ""According to our estimates, about 160,000 people are in the besieged city of Mariupol today, where it is impossible to live because there is no water, no electricity, no heat, no connection,"" he said. ""And it's really scary."" It was unclear if there was still active fighting inside the city. Ukrainian officials have alleged that Russian forces have prevented humanitarian convoys from safely approaching or exiting the city. A pro-Russian separatist leader said on Sunday that about 1,700 Mariupol residents were being ""evacuated"" daily from the city and its surroundings. Ukrainian officials, however, say thousands were being forcibly ""deported"" to Russia. ""We need a complete evacuation from Mariupol,"" Boichenko said. ""Our most important mission today is to save every life ... And there are hopes that we will succeed. For example, there are 26 buses that have to go to Mariupol to evacuate, but unfortunately, they haven't received permission to move,"" he said. ""And this game is played every day. A cynical game like, 'Yes, we are ready. You can drive there,' but in fact it does not work,"" he said. ""Our heroic drivers under the fire are trying to reach the places where Mariupol residents can be picked up, and they are waiting with the hope that they will have such an opportunity. But the Russian Federation has been playing with us since day one."" Statistics released by Ukrainian officials on Sunday paint a grim picture of what has come from weeks of shelling and urban combat in Mariupol. Some 90% of residential buildings in the city were damaged, the data shows. Of those, 60% were hit directly and 40% were destroyed. Seven of the city's hospitals -- 90% of the city's hospital capacity -- were damaged, of which three were destroyed. Also damaged were three maternity hospitals (one destroyed), seven institutes of higher education (three destroyed), and 57 schools and 70 kindergartens, with 23 and 28 destroyed, respectively. A number of factories were damaged and the city's port sustained damage. According to those official statistics, up to 140,000 people left the city before it was surrounded, and around 150,000 managed to leave during the blockade. Ukrainian officials claim 30,000 people from Mariupol were deported to Russia.",47,5.251630520503647,4.383800451839862,0.8678300686637845,24
2022-03-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/26/politics/jen-easterly-interview-russia-cnntv/index.html,"'Preparation, not panic': Top US cyber official asks Americans to look out for Russian hacking efforts","The US government is wary about the possibility of a Russian cyberattack on US critical infrastructure paired with Kremlin attempts to spread disinformation about any incident's effects to sow panic among Americans, a top US cyber official told CNN. ""All businesses, all critical infrastructure owners and operators need to assume that disruptive cyber activity is something that the Russians are thinking about, that are preparing for, that are exploring options, as the President said,"" Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Pamela Brown. ""That's why we are so focused on making sure that everybody understands the potential for this disruptive cyber activity,"" Easterly said. ""And it's not about panic. It's about preparation."" Easterly pointed to the example of a cybercriminal attack on Colonial Pipeline last year, which shut down delivery of fuel to the East Coast for days and led to Americans hoarding gasoline. The Biden administration has for months warned that Moscow could respond to US sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine with cyberattacks on US infrastructure — or that ransomware gangs like the one that hit Colonial Pipeline could lash out. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming,"" President Joe Biden told business leaders March 21. Easterly called Biden's statement, which said Russia was conducting ""preparatory activity"" for a potential cyberattack, ""pretty unprecedented."" ""I think what makes the moment different is just seeing what the Russians have done with this unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and then understanding there can be some very real consequences of that in cyberspace,"" Easterly told CNN. Easterly's agency, established in 2018, is charged with advising the owners and operators of power plants, manufacturing facilities and other critical infrastructure on how to defend against such threats. Agencies like CISA and the departments of Treasury and Energy have in recent months held cyberthreat briefings on Russian hacking capabilities for America's biggest banks and electric utilities. Many of those critical infrastructure operators have spent years investing in network defense and studying high-profile Russian cyberattacks like one that cut power in Ukraine for a quarter million people. A month into the war in Ukraine, the Russian military has stumbled and still failed to take the capital of Kyiv. ""I would imagine that there is a lot of pressure, a lot of stress on not just the Russian military but against the Russian intelligence officers,"" said Easterly, a former US Army intelligence officer.",20,6.468160728705191,6.922283979750919,-0.45412325104572737,2
2022-03-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-new-phase-intl-cmd/index.html,Ukrainians disrupt and derail Russian offensive as war moves to new phase,"Just over a month after the first ballistic missiles slammed into Kyiv's international airport, the Russian campaign has been disrupted and derailed by stubborn Ukrainian resistance -- and in the last few days by agile Ukrainian counterattacks on several fronts. Russian forces retain considerable -- but not overwhelming -- numerical superiority. Their armored groups have struggled against Western-supplied anti-tank weapons and Turkish-made drones. Ukrainian air defenses have punched above their weight and are now being reinforced by thousands of US-made Stinger missiles. Poor logistical support, questionable tactics and growing evidence of poor morale among Russian battalion tactical groups have allowed the Ukrainian military to hold off Russian advances in several regions -- and begin to take the fight to the enemy. CNN analysis of satellite imagery, social media content and official statements from both sides suggests the conflict may now be moving into a new phase: a war of attrition in which the Russians may lose more ground than they gain and suffer even greater resupply issues as the Ukrainians cut into their extended lines. There are indications that the Russian military is trying to compensate for this by greater use of missile forces and indirect fire from artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. To the north and west of Kyiv, for example, the Russians appear to be digging in rather than seeking to advance, shelling areas like Irpin and Makariv, where Ukrainian troops have established a tenuous hold. In the last two weeks, there's been an uptick in Russian missile strikes, from Lviv in the west to Zhytomyr in central Ukraine and Mykolaiv in the south, with prime targets being fuel dumps, military depots and airfields. Ukraine goes on the attack The Ukrainians have been mostly circumspect about going on the offensive, but on Friday National Security Adviser Oleksiy Danilov said: ""We are going on the counterattack in some areas, and this counterattack is absolutely productive."" These fightbacks are limited and focused but include fronts in the south, central Ukraine and the northeast. The Institute for the Study of War, in its latest assessment, describes them as ""prudent and effective, allowing Ukrainian forces to regain small areas of tactically or operationally significant terrain without overextending themselves."" The south The push towards the Russian-occupied city of Kherson is perhaps the most ambitious. After resisting attempts by Russian forces to take Mykolaiv -- a bridgehead for assaulting Odesa -- the Ukrainians launched devastating missile attacks against the Russian command at Kherson's airport (killing a Russian general in the process, they say) and gained ground to the north of the city. This as civil disobedience in the city has frayed the nerves of Russian troops. On Sunday, a large crowd took to the streets of Kakhovka -- east of Kherson -- to protest Russian occupation. A local journalist, Oleh Baturin, told CNN that Russian forces still controlled the area. Kakhovka matters because it's close to a bridge linking Kherson with points east. A Russian land corridor linking Crimea with its border would be hard to sustain without that access. Baturin said there was heavy fighting near the nearby town of Tavriysk and Nova Kakhovka, where there was a large concentration of Russian forces. How this battle evolves could have a major bearing on the Russian campaign in the south. The northeast Perhaps surprisingly, Ukrainian units have also gained territory close to the Russian border, around the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. Kharkiv, just 30 miles from the Russian border, has been under almost constant attack since the first day of the invasion but remains in Ukrainian hands. Ukrainian forces now appear to have retaken some outlying areas. Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration, claimed Saturday that ""several settlements were liberated"" east of the city. A long video analyzed by CNN showed an assault by troops of the ultra-nationalist Azov Battalion on a village near Kharkiv in which they took a number of Russian prisoners, some of them apparently badly wounded. Other videos showed a string of villages south of Kharkiv now in Ukrainian hands. Russian forces continue a weeks-long attempt to take Izium, to the south of Kharkiv, but Ukrainian resistance continues in the heavily damaged city. A local official, Maksym Strelnyk, said Sunday that ""currently, the situation in Izium is extremely complicated. Fierce fighting continues."" Still in the northeast, CNN has geo-located video and images showing Ukrainian forces back in control of the town of Trostyanets, some 30 miles from the city of Sumy, with Russian armor including a T-80 tank and infantry fighting vehicles damaged and abandoned. The Ukrainian 93rd Brigade posted images on its Facebook account showing its soldiers in Trostyanets, and said the Russians had fled -- ""leaving behind weapons, equipment and ammunition."" Near Kyiv Just east of Kyiv the last few days have seen Ukrainian gains in a largely rural area some 40 miles (70 kms) from the capital, around the villages of Lukyanivka and Rudnytske. If sustained, these gains could complicate an already long Russian supply chain and even cut off forward Russian units. It's not all one-way traffic. The city of Chernihiv north of Kyiv is still surrounded by Russian forces, which have also entered the nearby city of Slavutych this weekend. Social media videos showed them in control of the center of the city, using stun grenades and bursts of automatic fire into the air as a crowd of several hundred Ukrainian civilians protested. And the Russians retain the ability to shell the outskirts of Kyiv from the north. Moscow's shifting language As their ground campaign falters, Russian officials have asserted that encircling Ukrainian cities actually serves an ulterior goal: to pin down Ukrainian forces and prevent them from focusing on the separatist regions of Donbas. Colonel General Sergei Rudskoy, first deputy chief of Russia's General Staff, said Friday that laying siege to Ukrainian cities and damaging military infrastructure ""allow us not only to tie down their forces and prevent them from strengthening their grouping in the Donbas."" In announcing the special military operation on February 24, President Vladimir Putin said it was aimed at securing Donbas -- the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk -- from an alleged Ukrainian assault. Rudskoy appeared to reference that, saying, ""In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed."" The Russian intention was never to storm Ukrainian cities, he insisted, adding that while the possibility was not excluded ""our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing -- the complete liberation of Donbas."" But Rudskoy also referred to a more ambitious goal of Putin, the so-called ""demilitarization and denazification"" of Ukraine. The available evidence suggests Russian forces are edging forward on the fringes of Donbas. But a significant component of those forces has been itself tied down in the grueling siege of Mariupol. Losses there will affect their ability to project force elsewhere in the southeast. The Institute for the Study of War said Rudskoy's comments ""could indicate that Russia has scaled back its aims and would now be satisfied with controlling the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, but that reading is likely inaccurate."" The ISW says: ""The absence of significant Russian offensive operations throughout most of Ukraine likely reflects the inability of the Russian military to generate sufficient combat power to attack rather than any decision in Moscow to change Russia's war aims or concentrate on the east."" The Ukrainian armed forces command appears unconvinced too, saying that Russian units are reorganizing and consolidating to replace combat losses. All of which suggests a second and possibly still bloodier phase of the conflict is about to begin, as Russia tries to reinvigorate a faltering campaign on the ground while doubling down on its use of cruise and ballistic missiles.",7,4.75302129579472,0.9336080144472261,3.8194132813474937,13
2022-03-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/26/europe/lviv-ukraine-attack-saturday-intl/index.html,"Lviv, western Ukrainian city until now spared from Russian assault, rocked by powerful explosions","At least five people were reportedly injured Saturday after at least two missiles struck Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that had been previously spared the worst of Russia's brutal onslaught, local officials said. One of the strikes hit a fuel storage facility, causing it to catch fire, and a later strike caused ""significant damage"" to the city's infrastructure facilities, according to the city's mayor, Andriy Sadovyi. Three powerful blasts were heard in the center of the city earlier, and plumes of thick black smoke could be seen rising in the distance. Air raid sirens rang out prior to the explosions. Maksym Kozytsky, the head of the Lviv regional military administration, later on his Telegram account reported three more explosions following the strike on the fuel depot, saying, ""The air alarm remains."" Lviv is a strategic Ukrainian city close to the Polish border that has largely been spared from the relentless bombardment seen across much of the country during the Russian invasion. It was a surprising attack, coming just a day after the Russian military said that the first phase of the conflict had ended and that it was shifting its attention to the disputed eastern parts of Ukraine. The Russian military on Sunday confirmed strikes on fuel depots on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and outside of Kyiv, saying it had targeted fuel supplies for Ukrainian troops. In a briefing Sunday, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Igor Konashenkov also confirmed a separate strike on Lviv Saturday, saying cruise missiles had targeted the workshops of the Lviv radio repair plant, which he claimed carried out the overhaul and modernization of Ukrainian weapons systems. Separately, Konashenkov claimed that sea-launched weapons had targeted a Ukrainian missile storage facility 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv. Sadovyi said in an update on Twitter Sunday that it took firefighters 14 hours to put out the fire. The attack came as US President Joe Biden was in Poland Saturday, where he met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, as well as Ukrainian officials and refugees. Biden later delivered a speech outside the Royal Castle in the Polish capital of Warsaw, in which he declared forcefully that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power."" The White House afterward said Biden wasn't calling for regime change: ""The President's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,"" a White House official said. Earlier in the speech, Biden told the Ukrainian people: ""We stand with you. Period."" Biden was briefed on the strike on Lviv before leaving his hotel for his speech, according to a White House official. ""Now in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom, Ukraine and its people are on the front lines, fighting to save their nation, and their brave resistance is part of a larger fight for ... essential democratic principles that unite all free people,"" Biden said. Sadovyi initially said on Twitter Saturday that Russian troops had attacked the city but did not provide extensive detail. He urged residents to stay in shelters. An industrial facility in Lviv used for fuel storage was burned as a result of one of the Russian strikes, according to Sadovyi. ""As a result of the shelling, one of the industrial facilities burns. It is fuel storage,"" the mayor said. He did not clarify if this was the cause of the smoke. The mayor added that ""habitable infrastructure was not injured."" Sadovyi later confirmed that another strike had hit Lviv, causing ""significant damage"" to the city's infrastructure. Residential buildings were not damaged, he added. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities said Saturday that bus convoys trying to evacuate civilians were being stopped and held by Russian forces, as part of what they claimed to be a pressure campaign to force some residents to go to Russia. In a statement, Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional administration, said an evacuation convoy of more than 50 buses driving from the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia was held overnight at a Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka, about 35 miles south of Zaporizhzhia. Starukh said the convoy included two ambulances carrying three children requiring urgent medical care. Saturday's strikes were not the first strikes on Lviv. Several Russian missiles hit an aircraft repair plant there on March 18. Work at the facility had stopped before the strikes, and there were no reports of casualties. Saturday's attacks come after a top Russian general claimed Friday that the ""first stage"" of Russia's military plan was complete, with their primary focus now centered on eastern Ukraine. It was unclear if the statement implied a shifting of the goalposts for the Russian military or just represents a change in public messaging. ""In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed,"" said Col. General Sergei Rudskoy, first deputy chief of Russia's General Staff, in a briefing. ""The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been significantly reduced, allowing us, I emphasize again, to focus the main efforts on achieving the main goal - the liberation of Donbas."" After days of Western leaders displaying their united front against Russia, Saturday's strikes could be seen as a response from Putin and his military to Biden and the West. The Russian military has claimed it is not targeting civilians or residential areas, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.",47,3.0751567728628917,1.8490626096196896,1.226094163243202,25

""The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been significantly reduced, allowing us, I emphasize again, to focus the main efforts on achieving the main goal - the liberation of Donbas."" Rudskoy's remarks come as Russia's advances appear to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. Russia has also failed to achieve air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses of personnel since the start of the invasion. ""The public and individual experts are wondering what we are doing in the area of ​​the blockaded Ukrainian cities,"" Rudskoy said. ""These actions are carried out with the aim of causing such damage to military infrastructure, equipment, personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the results of which allow us not only to tie down their forces and prevent them from strengthening their grouping in the Donbas, but also will not allow them to do this until the Russian army completely liberates the territories of the DPR and LNR."" Rudskoy was referring to the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, separatist territories in eastern Ukraine that Russia recognized on the eve of its invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that the goal of what Russian officials refer to euphemistically as the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is the complete demilitarization of the country. Putin has said the war is going according to plan, but Russian forces have incurred serious losses: Rudskoy said in the same briefing that 1,351 military personnel had been killed in Ukraine and 3,825 had been wounded. US, NATO and Ukrainian officials estimate the Russian casualty count is much higher. ""Initially, we did not plan to storm them in order to prevent destruction and minimize losses among personnel and civilians,"" Rudskoy said. ""And although we do not exclude such a possibility, however, as individual groupings complete the tasks set, and they are successfully solved, our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing -- the complete liberation of Donbas."" It is unclear if Rudskoy's statement implies a shifting of the goalposts for the Russian military, or just represents a change in public messaging.

2022-03-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/25/europe/ukraine-mariupol-theater-dead-intl/index.html,"300 people were killed in Russian airstrike on Mariupol theater, Ukrainian authorities say","About 300 people are believed to have died in a Russian attack on a theater in Mariupol nine days ago, the city council has said, citing eyewitness reports. The March 16 bombing of Mariupol's Drama Theater, where Ukrainian officials say up to 1,300 had sought refuge, was among the most brazen of Russia's attacks on civilians since its invasion began in late February. Painted on the ground outside the building -- in giant Russian letters -- was the word ""CHILDREN."" The message -- large enough to be viewed from the sky -- was scrawled near a public square. Russia has denied its forces hit the theater, claiming instead that the Azov battalion, the Ukrainian army's main presence in Mariupol, blew it up. Announcing the update on its Telegram channel, the city council said: ""Unfortunately, we start the day with bad news. There is information, based on eyewitnesses, that about 300 people died in the Drama Theater in Mariupol as a result of a bombing by Russian aircraft. ""We still do not want to believe in this horror. We still want to believe that everyone managed to escape. But the words of those who were inside the building at the time of this terrorist act say otherwise."" CNN has been unable to independently verify the death toll. Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor said on Telegraph that about 600 people are believed to have survived the attack. He added that many of those who survived were in the process of making their way out of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. ""The occupier knew where he was hitting. He knew what the consequences might be, and anyway the bombs fell on this place,"" the city council statement Friday said. Video of the aftermath of the bombing, which emerged recently on social media, shows people making their escape from the dusty and debris strewn building. Holes in the walls can be seen as people make their way down a staircase to leave the theater. ""The missile hit right in the center of the Drama Theater,"" a man's voice can be heard saying. In a second video, which shows massive internal structural damage to the building, a man's voice offers reassurance that he and others with him on the ground floor of the building were not injured in the attack. But he expresses fears that many others who were sheltering in the building remain buried under the rubble. Breakdown of essential services The theater was being used as one of the main shelters in Mariupol, which has been under intense bombardment since the early days of Russia's assault on Ukraine. Information about the full extent of the attack has been slow to emerge due to the almost complete breakdown of essential services in the city, including communication networks. The coastal city has been under siege for several weeks and has seen some of the worst attacks in the war since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February. There is still no word on possible casualties after a separate attack on an art school building that was also being used as a shelter by up to 400 people. Basic services like gas, electricity and water, are all out in the city. Bodies are being left in the street because there is either no one left to collect them, or it is simply too dangerous to try. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced two evacuation corridors for Mariupol and occupied Melitopol on Friday. Speaking in a televised message, Vereshchuk said the corridors will link the two cities with Zaporizhzhia, which lies to the north and is still in Ukrainian hands. Over the last week, Russian forces have been deporting thousands of Mariupol residents against their will to far-flung cities in Russia, according to city officials and witnesses. And on Monday, Moscow called on Mariupol to surrender -- a notion Ukraine swiftly shot down. Russia has denied targeting civilians in Mariupol, blaming casualties on Ukrainian forces. Andriushchenko told CNN on Sunday that the battle for the city has made it impossible to retrieve and identify the dead, or treat the wounded. In a video message posted to Facebook in the early hours of Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the siege of Mariupol would go down in history as a war crime. ""To do this to a peaceful city ... is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,"" he added.",47,2.276033457776215,6.963028768863262,-4.686995311087047,24
2022-03-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/politics/alleged-russian-hackers-indicted/index.html,4 Russian government operatives indicted for allegedly hacking global energy facilities between 2012 and 2018,"The United States has indicted four Russian men, including three Russian intelligence officers, for alleged hacking campaigns that targeted hundreds of energy companies around the world from 2012 to 2018, the US Justice Department said Thursday. The indictments cover activity from years ago but underscore Russian hacking capabilities against critical infrastructure at a time when US officials are on high alert for Russian cyberattacks and as President Joe Biden meets with European allies over Russia's war in Ukraine. Biden on Monday publicly warned US business executives that Kremlin-linked hackers could target US organizations as the Russian military continues to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine. The FBI also advised the private sector last week that hackers associated with Russian internet addresses have been scanning the networks of five US energy companies in a possible prelude to hacking attempts. There are no known compromises from that recent activity. But the new Justice Department charges point to Russia's hacking prowess and showcase the type of activity the US government is concerned about in light of tensions over Russia's war on Ukraine. In one indictment unsealed Thursday, three officers at Russia's FSB intelligence agency are accused of hacking into energy firms, including some in the US, from 2012 to 2017 ""in furtherance of the Russian government's efforts to maintain surreptitious"" access to organizations in the energy sector, the Justice Department said. US officials have expressed concern that Russian operatives could use that type of access to disrupt US critical infrastructure firms if Moscow had the incentive to. In the other indictment, an employee of a Russian Ministry of Defense research institute is accused of helping hack into a petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia in 2017 and causing it to shut down twice. That hacking incident caused alarm in the cybersecurity industry at the time because the malicious code used in the incident targeted safety systems that prevent explosions in power plants. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. All four of the indicted men are believed to be in Russia. ""In these two cases, we've determined that the benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future,"" a senior Justice Department official said. ""These charges show the dark art of the possible when it comes to critical infrastructure."" The three FSB officers are accused of being part of a hacking group that targeted numerous energy firms in the US and abroad from 2012 to 2017, including the computer network of a corporation that runs a power plant in Kansas. ""Although this (hacking) group is not associated with any known, deliberate disruptive event, today's indictment and previous research shows how extensively this group operated to breach critical systems globally,"" Joe Slowik, senior manager at cybersecurity firm Gigamon, told CNN. ""In light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, this activity becomes especially concerning as potential footholds for future destructive events."" Before the 2020 US election, the hacking group breached certain state and local government organizations, but the activity did not affect voting in any way. The other Russian hacking group referenced by Thursday's news, which was involved in the 2017 shutdown of the facility in Saudi Arabia, subsequently attempted to breach the computers of a US firm ""that managed similar critical infrastructure entities in the United States,"" the Justice Department said in a news release. That hacking attempt was unsuccessful, the senior Justice Department official told reporters Thursday. In December, the same hacking group probed the computer networks of US electric utilities that operate liquefied natural gas facilities, CNN previously reported. US officials have briefed firms from the US energy and financial sectors, among others, extensively on Russian hacking capabilities in recent months, and many big firms have invested heavily in cyber defenses in recent years.

2022-03-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/politics/ukraine-us-request-javelin-stinger-missiles/index.html,Ukraine tells the US it needs 500 Javelins and 500 Stingers per day,"Ukraine has updated its extensive wishlist of additional military assistance from the US government in the past several days to include hundreds more anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles than previously requested, according to a document provided to CNN that details the items needed. The Ukrainians have submitted similar lists in recent weeks but a recent request provided to US lawmakers appears to reflect a growing need for American-made Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles -- with Ukraine saying it urgently needs 500 of each, daily. In both cases, Ukraine is asking for hundreds more missiles than were included in a similar list recently provided to US lawmakers, according to a source with knowledge of both requests. The new list comes as the Ukrainians have claimed they face potential weapons shortages amid an ongoing Russian assault -- prompting some pushback from US and NATO officials who stress that more military aid is already going into the country. By March 7, less than two weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US and other NATO members had sent about 17,000 anti-tank missiles and 2,000 anti-aircraft missiles into Ukraine. Since then, NATO countries, including the US, have kept the pipeline of weapons and equipment flowing, even as Russia has threatened to target the shipments. The last of a US $350 million security assistance packaged approved in late February arrived in Ukraine within the last few days, a senior defense official said, while the next two packages totaling $1 billion have already started to arrive. President Joe Biden said Thursday that ""armor systems, ammunition and our weapons are flowing into Ukraine as I speak."" The defense official said it would be ""multiple flights over many days"" to get the equipment to Eastern Europe before it enters Ukraine at multiple land border crossings. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the United Kingdom announced it would ship 6,000 more missiles, including anti-tank and high explosive weapons, to Ukraine, along with approximately $33 million in financial backing for the Ukrainian military. The list provided to CNN details several other urgent needs, including: jets, attack helicopters and anti-aircraft systems like the S-300. Two types of Russian-made jets are listed in the document, including one designed to provide close air support for troops on the ground. Ukraine has asked for 36 of each aircraft, according to the list provided to CNN. Some lawmakers in Congress believe the US should provide Ukraine with the weapons they're requesting as quickly as possible. Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, visited Poland and Germany last weekend to meet with civil society organizations helping Ukrainian refugees who've arrived in those countries as well as US troops stationed abroad helping with humanitarian efforts. Rosen said her biggest takeaway from the trip was the ""sense of urgency"" on the ground. ""They need all the tools to not just survive the war, but to win the war, so whether we provide them air-to-ground missiles, drones, all the military support,"" Rosen told CNN.",49,7.635314228425788,5.582498472412121,2.0528157560136666,8
2022-03-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/europe/ukraine-war-russian-soldiers-deaths-cmd-intl/index.html,"The bodies of Russian soldiers are piling up in Ukraine, as Kremlin conceals true toll of war","Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) — The first warm, sunny days of spring in the southern Mykolaiv region are ushering in a grim new reality: the smell of the dead. As the frost melts and ground thaws, the bodies of Russian soldiers strewn across the landscape are becoming a problem. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Vitaly Kim, the region's governor, called on local residents to help collect the corpses and put them in bags, as temperatures rise to above freezing. ""We're not beasts, are we?"" he implored residents, who have already lost so many of their own in this war. Mykolaiv was among the first regional capitals to be attacked after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on February 24. After pushing into the urban center, Russian troops have been forced out by Ukraine's military, leaving a trail of blackened combat vehicles and tanks in their wake. But the battle for the city, a cornerstone in Russia's westward quest along the Black Sea coast to Odesa, is still raging and it's unclear how long Ukrainian forces will be able to fend off the assault. Referring to them as ""orcs""— the evil, monstrous army in J. R. R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" — Kim said that the Russians had retreated and left their colleagues' charred bodies behind on the battlefield. He sent CNN pictures of the abandoned corpses, adding: ""There are hundreds of them, all over the region."" The governor has called for the bodies to be placed into refrigerators and sent back to Russia for identification through DNA testing. But, a month into the war, it is still unclear how or if the remains of soldiers are being repatriated to Russia, where reports about the death toll have largely been silenced. The country has cracked down on any information about the realities of the bloody war, restricting access to Western media reports, as well as the social networks Twitter and Facebook, in Russian territory. Exactly how many Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine remains a mystery. The official line from Russia's defense ministry was 498 military personnel until Monday, when pro-Putin Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda published a report updating the toll to 9,861. The figure, which was attributed to the ministry and later retracted by the paper — which claimed it was hacked — has not been confirmed by the Kremlin, whose spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday told CNN: ""As far as the numbers are concerned, we agreed from the very beginning that we do not divulge the information."" That number tallies with information shared with CNN by US and NATO officials, who gave a recent estimate that Russian casualties range from between 3,000 and 10,000. Ukrainian officials have claimed the toll is even higher, at more than 15,000. CNN has been unable to verify the overall number of Russian deaths. One of the most searing, early images of the war in Ukraine was of a dead Russian soldier, his face and body obscured by a dusting of newly fallen snow. The picture, shot by New York Times photojournalist Tyler Hicks, captured the anonymity of the more than 150,000 Russians sent to fight their neighbors — and the anxiety of Russian families desperate to find out any information about their fate. The Ukrainian government has claimed that the Russian army sent mobile crematoriums to burn their own dead. ""The Russian people dying here, nobody is counting them, people dying in this war. Do you know they have brought a cremation chamber with them? They're not going to show the bodies to their families. They're not going to tell the mothers that their children died here,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters in a briefing on March 3. On the same day, Ukrzaliznytsia, the state-owned Ukrainian Railways, said in a statement on its website that it had provided Ukraine's armed forces with 20 refrigerated cars for the removal of dead Russian soldiers from several areas, including Odesa. Just 72 hours later, Ukrzaliznytsia's chairman posted a message on his personal Telegram channel saying that Russia never came to load them. ""For the sake of 'victorious' propaganda, they are ready to deprive mothers of even the opportunity to bury the bodies,"" Oleksandr Kamyshin wrote. Ukraine's government said it is still waiting to receive a request from Russian authorities for the repatriation of the bodies of those killed. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister said the issue of collecting and identifying the bodies had been discussed in a meeting between Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, on Thursday. But the ICRC has not confirmed whether it is assisting Ukraine in the return of Russian remains to their home country, which is provided for under international law. Hints at the scale of Russia's troop losses have begun to emerge in videos and reports. On March 18, the Belarus service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a US-funded media organization, published images of Russian ambulance convoys appearing to arrive at field hospitals in southern Belarus, near Ukraine's border, and reported that morgues in the area were overflowing. A March 21 report by English-language Ukrainian media outlet The Kyiv Independent followed a Ukrainian emergency response unit digging up Russian soldiers buried in unmarked communal graves in Rusaniv, a village east of the capital — left in a heap without identification documents or IDs. Russian state media reports have stuck to the 498 figure and few funerals have been documented in the country, where censorship of the war has been taken to an extreme with a new law criminalizing reporting contradicting the Kremlin. In the absence of information about Russia's dead, Ukrainians have been trying to fill in the gaps. A website and Telegram channel established by the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, aimed at Russian families, publishes a steady stream of photos of dead soldiers and captured young men, sometimes alongside their identity cards. The name of the site, 200rf.com, is a grim nod to Gruz-200, or Cargo-200, a military code word that came into use in the 1980s during the war in Afghanistan, used by the Soviets for the bodies of soldiers placed in zinc-lined coffins for transport. Viktor Andrusiv, an adviser to Ukraine's internal affairs minister and the creator and coordinator of the channel, also known as ""Look for Your Own,"" said he launched the initiative to help Russian families track down information about their soldiers. ""We are not making war against the Russian people. And I don't think they should suffer because of their regime, which lies to them and says everything is good, no one is dying,"" he told CNN. ""It's a way for us to bring them some truth."" But identifying dead Russian soldiers has been a difficult task. Andrusiv said only 30 have been found on the Telegram channel by their relatives, who scan through gruesome images of those killed in action for clues about whether their loved ones are alive or dead. Ukrainian forces send Andrusov images of deserted bodies, but they're often unrecognizable and have no documents on them. ""It's very difficult to identify the dead because normally they don't have documents with them, normally the commanders take their documents and put them in some boxes. Normally they die in this fire, in shelling. And you cannot identify the metal 'dog tags,' where their number is written, it gives us no information about the person,"" Andrusiv said. And as March turns to April, and temperatures climb to around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, the problem is getting worse. ""The problem with Russian bodies is really huge. It's thousands of them. Before the war, the weather was cold, it was okay but now we have problems because Russians don't want to take the bodies,"" Andrusiv said. ""I actually don't know what we will do in the next weeks with their bodies.""",7,5.00514544276947,2.378000089990299,2.627145352779171,18
2022-03-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/europe/ukraine-war-scenarios-cmd-intl/index.html,5 things that could happen in Ukraine next,"It's been a month since Russian troops invaded Ukraine, and despite making some rapid early gains, their advancement on some key cities, including the capital of Kyiv, has slowed. While there's a growing picture that Russia's assault on Ukraine has not gone to plan, the country continues to use its air power to obliterate cities and target civilians to push Ukraine into submission. So where is this war going? Here are five things to watch out for in coming weeks. 1. Russia could intensify its bombing campaign Experts are warning that the more Russia takes a hit on the ground, the more likely it is to intensify its aerial bombing campaign and the use of other ""standoff"" weapons that put Russian soldiers in less danger. There is little reliable information coming out of either Ukraine or Russia on death tolls, but a report in a Russian tabloid on Monday suggested that the Russian side had lost nearly 10,000 soldiers and that another 16,000 had been injured. The Komsomolskaya Pravda website removed the numbers later in the day, claiming the numbers only appeared in the first place because it had been hacked. CNN could not verify the numbers, but the death toll is closer to what US intelligence agencies have been reporting. And in the region of southern Mykolaiv, local authorities are mulling what do with hundreds of Russian corpses. Such losses, if proven to be true, would explain both the stall in ground movement and the uptick in aerial bombing of key cities and other standoff attacks. A senior US defense official, for example, said Russia has begun firing on the southern city of Mariupol from ships in the Sea of Azov. ""Russia still has capabilities and reserves, and there's going to be an uptick in intensity as it makes an effort to bring in more troops,"" Jeffrey Mankoff, a distinguished research fellow at the US National Defense University's Institute for National Strategic Studies, told CNN. A recent UK Defense Ministry update said that Russia was pulling in troops from across the country, and as far away as its Pacific Fleet. It is also pulling fighters from Armenia and private military companies, Syrians and other mercenaries, it said. The question is how long Russia can continue with high losses of personnel. ""There's going to be more troops and other equipment and help, of course, but there is a point where it's going to be hard to sustain this kind of an operational tempo, particularly the figures that we've been hearing about both in terms of men and material losses, when it outstrips the ability to resupply,"" Mankoff said. 2. While there's focus on Kyiv, Russia may try to encircle Ukrainian fighters in the east There is a lot of talk about the Russian war effort stalling, but whether or not that's true comes down to what Moscow's objectives were in the first place. Even that's hard to know for sure, as the country's public justification for its invasion is clear propaganda -- the ""denazification of Ukraine,"" for example. It's likely that Russia is, at the very least, trying to absorb parts of eastern Ukraine. Areas like Donetsk and Luhansk, which make up the Donbas region, have been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, and while Russia's ambitions may stretch beyond Donbas, it's still likely a central focus, experts say. While there is a lot of attention on Russia's push toward Kyiv, most of the Ukrainian army remains near Donetsk and Luhansk, where they are grouped as the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). The movement of Russian troops suggest they are trying to encircle the JFO on three axes, and this is likely to be Russia's main focus. That's clear by looking at the sophistication of the kind of troops being sent there, said Sam Cranny-Evans, a research analyst with the Royal United Services Institute. ""The Southern Military District -- in Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol -- these are the best troops in the Russian army. And they always work. They're designed to fight NATO,"" Cranny-Evans told CNN. ""So the forces that were committed to the Kyiv encirclement suggests that it was a goal that either Russia thought would be easily achieved, or they overestimated the capabilities of those forces. So that leads, in part, to the conclusion that an encirclement of the Ukrainian troops in the JFO is part of the goal that Russia is looking to achieve. And the movements of Russian forces do seem to suggest that that is the case."" He added that the Western media was so focused on Russia's losses and Ukraine's defiance that it was giving a false sense of the dynamics of the war. ""If we look at these maps, it's clear that Russian forces have actually advanced a long way into a very big country. They have taken quite a few towns, so there are now a lot more Ukrainian citizens living under Russian rule than there were three weeks ago,"" Cranny-Evans said. ""Regardless of how many Russian vehicles have blown up, or how many Russian soldiers are killed, there's also likely to be a very high number of Ukrainians that have suffered a similar fate."" 3. There will be more talk about talks One scenario is that the Ukraine war could become a protracted conflict. But it's likely that Russia has lost a significant number of soldiers, weapons and equipment in the war, and while it has engaged in long-running conflicts in the past, it won't want to leave this one with its military totally destroyed. So it may be willing to take talks seriously, analysts say. ""The negotiations are the one area where things are looking a little promising because both Russia and Ukraine have said in the last week that they're moving towards an actual substantive discussion, instead of Russia just laying down an ultimatum,"" Keir Giles, a Russian expert at the UK-based think tank Chatham House, told CNN. Russian officials have said that their demands include Ukraine dropping its pitch to join NATO and to demilitarize and adopt a ""neutral"" status, like Austria and Sweden have. But the conditions for what that means for Ukraine would have to be negotiated. President Vladimir Putin's chief spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told CNN in an interview Tuesday that Russia also wanted Ukraine to accept that Crimea -- which Russia annexed in 2014 -- is officially part of Russia and that the breakaway statelets of Luhansk and Donetsk ""are already independent states."" Numerous experts have speculated that Russia will look to carve off parts of eastern Ukraine. ""It's going to be painful to deliberate, unless it becomes possible for Western aid, both military and humanitarian, to be absorbed in Ukraine at sufficient rates that they can genuinely turn the tide against the Russian advancement,"" Giles said. ""If it's a question of who can pour in the greater resources and take the greater pain in order to prevail, Russia has a track record for inflicting substantial economic damage on itself and suffering on its own population, in order to prosecute wars,"" said Giles, referring to sanctions that are starting to bite the Russian economy. But US officials are not so optimistic talks will go well. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a press conference last week that a diplomatic solution to the war was unlikely, saying that Russia's actions ""are in total contrast to any serious diplomatic effort to end the war."" He also suggested that Russia would escalate the war by using chemical weapons. 4. There could be wholesale 'deportations' of Ukrainians into Russia. That's worrying Russia has been telling residents of the southern city of Mariupol to leave as it carries on an aggressive aerial bombardment that has torn the city to pieces. It forces have opened what they call ""humanitarian corridors"" to allow civilians to flee, but tens of thousands of them have been transported to Russia. Russian state media organization RIA Novosti reported that nearly 60,000 residents of Mariupol had reached Russian territory ""in complete safety."" Russian media has shown lines of vehicles apparently heading east to the border, some 40 kilometers from Mariupol. But Mariupol council accused Russia of forcing residents to go to Russia against their will. ""Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents have been taken to Russian territory,"" the city said in a statement. Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko said Saturday that ""what the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people."" Giles said there was a concern of a reprise of that dark history in the coming weeks. ""Russia has a history of vicious and savage reprisals against civilians in any area when any kind of resistance movement is taking place. It's moved already to deport people from Mariupol to the remote parts of Russia, which is straight out of Russia's 20th century script for dealing with these problems,"" he said. Giles referred to the ""deportations"" of hundreds of thousands of people from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which Russia annexed into the Soviet Union at the start of World War II. ""'Deportation' is a euphemism. It's been used as a fairly innocuous term for what happened to these people, which was effectively enslavement and starvation. is shipping off the women, the children, the people that you want to remove from societies in order to neutralize them,"" Giles said. ""They are generally met with pretty horrific fates. If they survived at all, they did not return for years or decades."" 5. Millions more Ukrainians could flee, leaving a nation in pieces The fate of the war is one thing, but the fate of Ukraine is another. Just as Russian air power left some of Syria's cities and towns in rubble, parts of Ukraine are beginning to look the same. Already, more than 3.5 million Ukrainians have left the country. Most are women and children, meaning families are also being torn apart. The war has triggered the biggest movement of refugees Europe has seen since World War II. Those numbers are increasing at a rate of around 100,000 people a day. If you include the number of people internally displaced, 10 million Ukrainians have now left their homes. That's nearly a quarter of the country's population. And what past wars show is that refugees often never return to their home countries. So often there is little to return to. Sometimes the threat of yet another war is enough to keep refugees away. It's something that negotiators will need to think about in any talks on the horizon. Even if a diplomatic solution can be found to end this war, a question that will remain is whether it's enough to prevent the next one, Cranny-Evans said. ""If we look, historically, at authoritarian regimes that perform poorly in a military setting, they don't tend to change their behavior in a positive direction afterwards. So the question might be that i",7,2.6898432001502925,3.5554296751420837,-0.8655864749917912,23
2022-03-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/europe/ukraine-pilot-battle-skies-cmd-intl/index.html,Inside the race to prevent Russia gaining full control of the skies above Ukraine,"The roar of a fighter jet engine forces Andriy into silence. As he waits for the aircraft to take off, the Ukrainian fighter pilot's flight mask covers half his face, hiding his identity, but his squinting eyes still reveal a jovial smile. ""Yes, that's ours,"" he says. Nowhere in the military match-up between Russia and Ukraine are the scales more tilted than in the air, where Moscow has more advanced aircraft and in much larger numbers. But nearly four weeks into the war, the Ukrainian Air Force is still flying and roaring, like the jet that delayed Andriy's interview with CNN. And Andriy says conditions have been shifting in favor of him and his cohorts. ""Now the situation is getting calmer,"" Andriy says. ""In the beginning they were succeeding due to their quantity, but now the situation is getting better. ""Many Russian pilots refuse to fight, because we are shooting them down,"" he claims. Andriy agreed to speak to us under the condition that his full identity, rank and location -- information that could help the Russian military target him -- are not revealed. He flies Russian-made Su-27 jets. ""I provide back up and cover for the aviation that is working at covering the ground. I focus on destroying missiles and enemy aviation, like air to air,"" he explained. ""I can't tell you how many, but I've shot down Russian jets."" So far, he and his fellow airmen have been able to hold off Russia's apparent superiority with careful planning and cunning tactics. Andriy doesn't go into detail about what those strategies entail, but says they involve close coordination with other Ukrainian forces, and taking some extreme risks. ""Russian pilots fly more modern jets and they are capable of firing missiles at much further distances,"" he said. ""For example, in order for us to deter missiles that are fired at 80 kilometers distance, we have to approach them at 40 kilometers. If they've already fired a missile at us, we somehow have to have it intercepted along the way."" And some of the moves they are employing on the battlefield are the result of training with the United States and other NATO allies. ""A few years ago, we had exercise 'Clear Sky' here in Ukraine and we flew alongside F-15 and F-16 jets,"" Andriy recalled. ""At the time we have developed certain tactics to deter fighter jets and I can tell you that some of those tactics really work."" The strategy is one part of the secret; the other is the pilots who are putting into practice. ""I wouldn't say their pilots' level of training is very high,"" Andriy said. ""Since our foreign partners started to send us air defense equipment of different types, such as midrange and close range, we've became more confident in the air."" ""Many Russian pilots now refuse to be deployed because they are scared,"" he adds. The battle for Ukrainian skies The skies above Ukraine remain up for grabs, nearly a month after Russian jets first flew into Ukrainian airspace. As of Tuesday, Ukrainian armed forces claimed to have shot down more than 100 Russian jets and 123 helicopters, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. CNN cannot independently verify those numbers. However, despite Russia not having released official data on the number of aircraft it has lost during the invasion -- it has also not updated the number of casualties it has suffered since March 2 -- the United States and other NATO allies have said that Moscow is losing equipment of all kinds, including planes. ""We don't believe the Russians have achieved air superiority over Ukraine,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told journalists on Tuesday. ""The airspace is contested, and it's contested because the Ukrainians are making it that way,"" he said. ""They're being very smart about how they're marshaling and using their air defense resources."" The Ukrainian military says the reason it's been able to fight back is because it was preparing for the possibility of a Russian invasion long before Russian soldiers started their march on Kyiv. ""We have been preparing for this scenario for eight years,"" said the spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, Lt. Col. Yuriy Ignat, adding that preparations began when Moscow occupied and then annexed Crimea in spring 2014. ""These eight years we have been learning how to beat the enemy with the weapons that we have. And they understand it."" ""It's why now they're switching to terror from the air,"" he added, accusing Russia of targeting civilian infrastructure. ""They drop bombs of 500 to 1,000 kilograms, they hit entire residential areas with children, women, hospitals. It looks like military terrorism and a crime against humanity."" Russia routinely denies causing civilian casualties in Ukraine. International media and observers have extensively documented civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. International investigations into possible war crimes are ongoing. Ignat says Ukraine is ""grateful"" to the United States and other NATO allies for the weapons they've been sending, but says his country needs more and better weapons. ""Russia is fighting with modern weapons -- missiles, hypersonic missiles. Therefore, we need Western weapons that are technologically as good as Russian ones. I am talking about NATO Integrated Air Defense System, F-15 Eagle or F-16 Fighting Falcon. They may be not used or decommissioned -- but they could serve the Ukrainian army,"" he said. ""With these weapons, we could confront the enemy on our own, we could close the sky."" The US has declined to transfer Soviet-era Mig-29 fighter jets -- which Ukraine already flies and Poland put at the Americans' disposition -- to Ukraine. It's unlikely Washington would support supplying F-15 and F-16 jets, which would require Ukrainian pilots to undergo further training. Andriy doesn't go that far but agrees Ukraine needs additional weaponry. ""In order for us to win, we need more than close-range systems, such as Stingers,"" he said, referring to shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles. ""Their tactics are constantly changing and now, most of the time, they are flying at the height of 50,000 feet,"" he said. ""Our Stingers are not able to reach them."" Ready to die for Ukraine While they wait for additional NATO equipment, Ignat said, Ukrainian pilots are bringing something extra to the battlefield. ""Fighting spirit and heroism should not be ruled out,"" he said. ""The Russians don't have that."" Yet, despite their perhaps surprising success, Kyiv's pilots continue to be the underdogs in the battle for Ukrainian skies. ""Sometimes two of our pilots fight against 10 planes,"" Ignat said. ""They take off with a one-way ticket, they understand that perhaps they are going to die."" Their precarious existence is not lost on Andriy. He's away from his family -- members of which are also involved in Ukraine's war effort, he says -- and he acknowledges that his job comes with a heavy psychological strain. ""Of course, I want this war to end soonest, but we will fight, our morale is strong. This is our land, and we will not let our opponent take part of it or destroy it,"" he said. ""We will fight till the end,"" he added. ""Every person is afraid of being killed, the difference is whether one dies with dignity or without it.""",49,2.6996754796362823,3.235682209337917,-0.5360067297016347,21
2022-03-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/russian-cyberattacks-what-matters/index.html,A cyberattack could lead to war. But it is very unlikely,"President Joe Biden issued an urgent and ominous warning to American individuals and businesses Monday, when he said ""evolving intelligence"" suggests Russia might be planning cyberattacks against the US. On Tuesday, an FBI advisory was sent to US companies in the energy, defense and financial sectors, warning of potential prep work for hacking from IP addresses in Russia. This activity is likely ""not about espionage, it's probably very likely about disruptive or destructive (cyber) activity,"" US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said during a phone briefing with industry executives and state and local government personnel, according to three sources on the call, writes CNN's Sean Lyngaas. Many warnings of a looming Russian cyberattack The advisory is part of a growing chorus of warnings that US infrastructure is at risk, writes Lyngass. ""For months, the US departments of Energy, Treasury and Homeland Security, among others, have briefed big electric utilities and banks on Russian hacking capabilities, and urged businesses to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious activity."" Some companies aren't prepared The bottom line of Biden's warning Monday and the FBI advisory was that the infrastructure behind US society and American life is mostly in private hands and that it needs to be made more secure from hacks. Anybody who remembers the ransomware attacks on the major US food manufacturer JBS, US cities, an oil pipeline and hospital systems in recent years knows this to be true. Biden has told Putin to cut it out Biden has warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to use cyberattacks against the US. The President on Monday referred to the conversations as an ""altar call."" ""We've had a long conversation about, if he uses it, what would be the consequence,"" Biden told business leaders on Monday. Biden has more control over that consequence than he does over the preparedness of US companies that are involved in American infrastructure. He appealed to their sense of ""patriotic obligation"" to get their cyber-defense capabilities up to scratch. He specifically mentioned the energy, power and financial sectors. What might a large-scale cyberattack look like? It's happened before. Estonia was the victim of a large-scale cyberattack in 2007, although there was not enough evidence to definitively pin it on Russia at the time. CNN's Ivana Kottasová wrote about the attack, which Estonia considered an act of cyber-warfare, last June. It all started with Estonia's decision to remove a Soviet-era war memorial from central Tallinn. Here are some key lines from her report: The attack made Estonia realize that it needed to start treating cyber threats in the same way as physical attacks. At that time, the country was already a leader in e-government, having introduced services like online voting and digital signatures. While no data was stolen during the incident, the websites of banks, the media and some government services were targeted with distributed denial of service attacks that lasted for 22 days. Some services were disrupted, while others were taken down completely. NATO and the international community took notice of the attack on Estonia and experts developed a standard to assess cyber-war as a result. When is a cyberattack an act of war? I called Tess Bridgeman, co-editor in chief of the website Just Security and a former attorney in the Obama White House who is an expert on war powers and international law. ""If a cyberattack causes significant death, destruction or injury, of the same sort that you would see from a more traditional attack using kinetic means, like bullets or missiles, you know, then you would call it a 'use of force' in international law,"" she said. A cyberattack that targeted a dam or air traffic control towers might rise to this level, but the government would try very hard to avoid responding to a cyberattack with a military attack, she said. The attacks on the US to date have fallen short of the threshold to justify a military response. As the government seeks countermeasures to respond, Bridgeman said, there's a good chance they won't be publicly known. ""It may appear that the US is sitting by idly, but I would be highly doubtful that that's the case,"" she said, arguing that defensive actions might be more effective at de-escalating the standoff. ""It's setting the example for what responsible state behavior looks like."" Could weapons be used to respond to a cyberattack? The threat of a military response is always there for the worst cyberattacks, should they cost American lives. ""Our policy, our declared policy is, if it's a big enough attack on us and it hurts us, we will use the conventional weapons response,"" Richard Clarke, who was a top adviser to President George W. Bush on cybersecurity, told CNN's Michael Smerconish shortly after the war in Ukraine began. ""So we could very easily find ourselves in a shooting war with Russia if they try devastating -- and that would have to be devastating -- cyberattacks like turning out the power grid,"" Clarke said. Most of these attacks are meant to be part of espionage campaigns or to be meddlesome rather than deadly. Clarke argued that Russian attacks on US industries could be more devastating than attacks on the government itself. He said the government doesn't really know what would happen if the Amazon, Google and Microsoft cloud systems went offline, for instance. ""I can tell you if those clouds go down, the United States stops working, our economy stops working, the phones stop working -- we will find ourselves pretty soon in the dark ages if the internet goes down,"" said Clarke. What if Russia attacked a US ally? It's not clear that Russia would want to provoke the US specifically in a such a devastating way, or how the US would respond. While its cyberattacks in Ukraine since the war began have been less severe than some expected, according to a report by Lyngass, Russia has targeted internet infrastructure in parts of the country. There has been concern that cyberattacks in Ukraine could spill over to nearby countries that are in NATO and could lead the organization to invoke Article 5 of its charter -- the principle that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members. Could a cyberattack trigger Article 5? A cyberattack could absolutely trigger Article 5. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made this clear in February just after Russia's invasion. ""An attack on one will be regarded as an attack on all,"" Stoltenberg said at a news conference when asked about a potential Russian cyberattack. But he added that NATO would be very careful in assessing an attack and would make sure a cyberattack on Ukraine -- shutting off electricity, say -- that accidentally spilled over into Poland or Romania is not construed as an attack on those countries. He also said it's intentionally unclear what kind of cyberattack would rise to the level of invoking Article 5. NATO, he said, would not want to ""give a potential adversary the privilege of defining exactly when we trigger Article 5.""",20,5.042089667617772,4.392024880509251,0.650064787108521,2
2022-03-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/europe/ukraine-new-phase-analysis-cmd-intl/index.html,Ukraine has denied Russia a victory for four weeks. A grim new phase could be coming,"On Monday, after intense fighting, Ukrainian forces regained control of Makariv, a town west of Kyiv that had been battered by Russian airstrikes. It's tempting to view this small victory for Ukrainian forces as a shift of momentum in the battle for Kyiv: In better times, this suburb would be only an hour's drive to Khreshchatyk, the capital's central boulevard. Kyiv once appeared to be the primary objective of what the Kremlin must have envisioned as a swift regime-change operation. The capital has been rocked by explosions in recent days, but it is far from encircled. On the Azov Sea, the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol -- despite being surrounded and mercilessly pummeled, block by block, by Russian firepower -- still eludes Russian control. Its defenders rejected an ultimatum to surrender by Monday morning, thwarting a Russian effort to finalize a land bridge linking Crimea with the separatist republics of the eastern Donbas region. Nearly a month after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian military has perceptibly shifted its messaging. The Russian military's advances have been stymied, the Ukrainians say, forcing a shift in Russian tactics. ""Due to the lack of success of the ground phase of the operation, the enemy continues to actively launch missile and bomb strikes on important military and civilian infrastructure using operational and tactical aircraft, high-precision missile weapons and indiscriminate munitions,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a statement Tuesday. There's plenty of evidence to suggest that the Russians are taking more of a standoff approach, launching salvos of missiles from outside of Ukrainian airspace. In a statement released Sunday, Russia's defense ministry said warships in the Caspian sea launched Kalibr cruise missiles and aircraft launched Kinzhal hypersonic missile systems from the airspace over Crimea. Those missiles targeted what the Russians described as a large storage base for fuels and lubricants of the Ukrainian military near the settlement of Kostyantynivka, in the southern Mykolaiv region. Separately, the Russian military said Kalibr cruise missiles were fired from the Black Sea, targeting a workshop for the repair of Ukrainian armored vehicles. Russian precision missiles also targeted what Russia described as a Ukrainian military training center near the settlement of Ovruch, in the northern Zhytomyr region. There is an element of PR to such costly displays of firepower: Russia is keen to export a version of the Kalibr and it has touted the Kinzhal as being able to elude missile-defense systems. The UK defense ministry, for one, was dismissive of Russian claims about the Kinzhal's combat debut, saying its use was ""highly likely intended to detract from a lack of progress in Russia's ground campaign. Deployment of Kinzhal is highly unlikely to materially affect the outcome of Russia's campaign in Ukraine."" Such assessments, however, give little solace to anyone on the receiving end of Russian firepower. Dozens were killed Friday in a missile strike on a barracks housing soldiers in Mykolaiv, and Russian long-distance strikes have struck areas far away from the front lines: At least 35 people were killed in strikes on March 13 against the Yavoriv military training ground in the Lviv region of western Ukraine, not far from the Polish border. More than 30 missiles fired from warplanes over the Black and Azov seas hit the base. Still, Russia has thus far not captured any major Ukrainian city in the offensive: neither Kharkiv in the northeast, nor Odesa in the southwest. Even Sumy and Chernihiv in the north, both of which are just across the border from major military staging areas inside Russia, remain under Ukrainian control. And in Kherson, a medium-sized city in the south under Russian control, Russian forces have faced another protracted problem: Angry locals who gather daily in the central square to tell Russian troops go home. One of those rallies ended Monday with one man seriously injured after Russian troops used gunfire and apparent stun grenades to disperse the crowd. Military analysts worry about another consequence of this emerging phase of the war: As Russian ground forces become bogged down and make little new progress, their leaders resort more to the indiscriminate and punitive use of firepower against Ukrainian cities. A March 19 assessment by the Institute for the Study of War gave precisely that grim prognosis. ""If the war in Ukraine settles into a stalemate condition, Russian forces will continue to bomb and bombard Ukrainian cities, devastating them and killing civilians, even as Ukrainian forces impose losses on Russian attackers and conduct counter-attacks of their own,"" the assessment read. ""The Russians could hope to break Ukrainians' will to continue fighting under such circumstances by demonstrating Kyiv's inability to expel Russian forces or stop their attacks even if the Russians are demonstrably unable to take Ukraine's cities. Ukraine's defeat of the initial Russian campaign may therefore set conditions for a devastating protraction of the conflict and a dangerous new period testing the resolve of Ukraine and the West."" Adding to that gloomy forecast, Ukrainian officials have begun warning of a potential new front in the war, with the country's General Staff saying Sunday the threat of an offensive from Belarus in the direction of northwestern Ukraine was ""high,"" without giving further specifics. Ukraine's northwestern Volyn region borders Belarus to the north and Poland, a NATO ally, to the west. It could -- theoretically -- serve as a gateway for attacking forces from the north to approach Lviv, a strategic city in western Ukraine that is a hub for both government logistics and relief efforts, as well as a transit point for many civilians looking to flee fighting in other parts of the country. Russia has already used Belarusian territory as a launching pad for its invasion, with Russian forces staging an offensive push toward Kyiv and central Ukraine from southern Belarus. It's unclear if Belarus would actively join the war. But the Ukrainian General Staff is already warning that Russia is now looking to bring in reserve forces to the borders of Ukraine. If true, that speaks volumes. It attests to the high cost the Russian military has already paid in terms of lives -- even though the Kremlin has not disclosed casualty totals since March 2. And it speaks to the political will of one person -- Russian President Vladimir Putin -- to continue expending blood and treasure in Ukraine.",7,5.162351888868884,5.391512341921171,-0.2291604530522866,13
2022-03-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/fbi-energy-hacking-warning/index.html,FBI advised that hackers scanned networks of 5 US energy firms ahead of Biden's Russia cyberattack warning,"Hackers associated with Russian internet addresses have been scanning the networks of five US energy companies in a possible prelude to hacking attempts, the FBI said in a March 18 advisory to US businesses obtained by CNN. The FBI issued the notice days before President Joe Biden publicly warned that Kremlin-linked hackers could target US organizations as the Russian military continues to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine and as Western sanctions on the Kremlin begin to bite. Deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger said during Monday's White House briefing that Russia had been conducting ""preparatory activity"" for cyber attacks, which she said could include scanning websites and hunting for software vulnerabilities."" The so-called ""preparatory activity"" that Neuberger mentioned Monday is likely ""not about espionage, it's probably very likely about disruptive or destructive [cyber] activity,"" US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said Tuesday on a phone briefing with industry executives and state and local government personnel, according to three sources on the call. There are at least 18 US companies in other sectors, such as defense and financial services that were subjected to the scanning, the FBI said. There are no confirmed breaches related to the scanning, but the FBI advisory is the latest in a chorus of warnings from US officials to critical infrastructure operators to be on alert for potential Russian hacking. The FBI advisory was meant for a private, technical audience to help companies protect their networks, while Biden's public warning was generic and meant to raise awareness of the threat. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming,"" Biden told business executives on Monday. The Russia-based Internet Protocol addresses, or data that identifies a computer, are ""believed to be associated with cyber actors who previously conducted destructive cyber activity against foreign critical infrastructure,"" the FBI said in its advisory. ""This scanning activity has increased since the start of the Russia/Ukraine conflict, leading to a greater possibility of future intrusions,"" the FBI memo states. CBS News first reported on the FBI advisory. For months, the US departments of Energy, Treasury and Homeland Security, among others, have briefed big electric utilities and banks on Russian hacking capabilities, and urged businesses to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious activity. CNN reported on February 2 that a foreign hacking group had probed the computer networks of US electric utilities that operate liquefied natural gas facilities. The hacking group developed tools used in an incident that forced a Saudi petrochemical plant to shut down in 2017, according to cybersecurity researchers. The Treasury Department in 2020 sanctioned a Russian government institute for its alleged involvement in that incident. An FBI spokesperson did not respond when CNN asked whether the bureau was referring to the same hacking group in its recent advisory. The spokesperson said in an emailed statement: ""While our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence products, the FBI routinely shares information with our law enforcement and industry partners in order to protect the communities they serve and work with. The FBI always encourages members of the public and private industry to be vigilant and report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement.""

2022-03-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/europe/biden-russia-hypersonic-missiles-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,What to know about hypersonic missiles fired by Russia at Ukraine,"A Russian bomber fired three hypersonic missiles at the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Monday night, Ukrainian officials said, as part of a barrage that leveled a number of civilian targets including hotels and a shopping mall. It is not the first time Moscow has deployed its Kinzhal hypersonic missile during its invasion, but it does appear to be a relatively rare occurrence. Russia said it used Kinzhal missiles Ukraine in mid-March -- a claim later confirmed by US officials to CNN -- in the first known use of the weapon in combat. In March, US President Joe Biden confirmed Russia's use of the Kinzhal missile, describing it as ""a consequential weapon ... it's almost impossible to stop it. There's a reason they're using it."" Biden's defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has downplayed the effectiveness of the missile, telling CBS in March that he ""would not see it as a game-changer."" And the UK defense ministry has previously said the Kinzhal missile is really just an air-launched version of the Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), which Russia has used repeatedly in its war on Ukraine. Here's what to know. Why the fear and hype about hypersonic missiles? First, it's important to understand the term. Essentially, all missiles are hypersonic -- which means they travel at least five times the speed of sound. Almost any warhead released from a rocket miles in the atmosphere will reach this speed heading to its target. It is not a new technology. What military powers -- including Russia, China, the United States and North Korea -- are working on now is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV). An HGV is a highly maneuverable payload that can theoretically fly at hypersonic speed while adjusting course and altitude to fly under radar detection and around missile defenses. An HGV is the weapon that's almost impossible to stop. And Russia is thought to have an HGV in its arsenal, the Avangard system, which Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 called ""practically invulnerable"" to Western air defenses. But the Kinzhal, as a variant of the Iskander SRBM, is not an HGV. While it does have limited maneuverability like the Iskander, its main advantage is that it can be launched from MiG-31 fighter jets, giving it a longer range and the ability to attack from multiple directions, according to a report last year from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The MiG-31K can strike from unpredictable directions and could avoid interception attempts altogether. The flying carrier vehicle might also be more survivable than the road-mobile Iskander system,"" the report said. The same report also noted that the ground-launched Iskander proved vulnerable to missile defense systems during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, during which Azeri forces intercepted an Armenian Iskander. ""This suggests that claims of the Kinzhal's invulnerability to missile defense systems may also be somewhat exaggerated,"" the report said. Does Ukraine have missile defenses? The United States and its NATO allies are already sending several surface-to-air missiles systems to Ukraine to aid in its defense. According to a senior US official in March, these additional systems included the Soviet-era SA-8, SA-10, SA-12 and SA-14 mobile air defense systems. NATO member Slovakia has also sent more modern S-300 missile defense batteries to Ukraine. In April, the United Kingdom promised £100 million ($123 million) worth of high-grade military equipment, including more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. Weeks later, Germany said it would supply 50 anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine. And the US is preparing a mammoth $40 billion aid package that would include additional anti-aircraft capabilities for the Ukrainian military. Why did Putin use the Kinzhal missile? Use in Ukraine marks the combat debut for Russia's Kinzhal system. ""On March 18, the Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse of missiles and aviation ammunition of Ukrainian troops in the village of Delyatin, Ivano-Frankivsk region,"" Russia's Defense Ministry said at the time. US officials later confirmed to CNN that Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine and were able to track the launches in real time. The launches in March were likely intended to test the weapons and send a message to the West about Russian capabilities, multiple sources told CNN. At that point, the war on the ground in Ukraine had become something of a stalemate. Russia may have been looking for victories it could tout. The UK defense ministry said at the time that Moscow probably deployed the Kinzhal to ""detract from a lack of progress in Russia's ground campaign."" Austin, the US defense secretary, used similar language in his CBS interview in March, saying Putin was""trying to reestablish some momentum."" By the end of March, the US assessed that Russian forces were running low on air-launched cruise missiles, according to a US defense official, who said there were indications that Russia was trying to preserve that inventory as part of its declining stocks of precision guided munitions.",49,4.853028477620409,4.564566504386481,0.28846197323392797,12

It is increasingly ""likely"" that Belarus will enter the conflict, a NATO military official said on Monday. ""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin needs support. Anything would help,"" the official explained. A Belarusian opposition source said that Belarusian combat units are ready to go into Ukraine as soon as in the next few days, with thousands of forces prepared to deploy. In this source's view, this would have less of an impact militarily than it will geopolitically, given the implications of another country joining the war. A senior NATO intelligence official said separately that the alliance assesses that the Belarusian government ""is preparing the environment to justify a Belarusian offensive against Ukraine."" Russia has launched its attack on Ukraine in part from Belarus' territory, and thousands of Russian troops amassed in Belarus ahead of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine last month, which the two countries had claimed was for training exercises. US and European sanctions in response to the war have targeted both Russian and Belarusian officials, including Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Belarus moved to change its constitution last month to allow the country to host both Russian forces and nuclear weapons permanently, though US officials have emphasized to CNN that they have not yet seen any evidence of Russia moving nuclear weapons or preparing to. The sources emphasized that there have been no indications to date that Belarus is currently participating in the fighting in Ukraine, and a senior US defense official said the Pentagon had not seen ""any indications that the Belarusians are preparing to move in -- into Ukraine or that they have made any agreements to do that."" The NATO military official said that a final decision for Belarus' involvement in the war still has to be made in Moscow, as of yet there has been no indication that Belarusian forces are participating in the fighting in Ukraine. ""It is not about what Lukashenko wants,"" the official explained. ""The question is: does Putin want another unstable country in the region?"" ""Involvement would destabilize Belarus,"" the official said.

2022-03-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/analysis-biden-warning-putin-cyberattack-us/index.html,Putin's next escalation could be a direct cyberattack on the US,"The most troubling takeaway from President Joe Biden's warning that there is ""evolving intelligence"" that Russia is exploring options for cyberattacks is that US spy agencies have been spot on so far in predicting Vladimir Putin's moves. It was always possible that the Russian leader could seek to impose direct reprisals on the US government and Americans for their support of Ukrainians and crippling sanctions on Russia after his brutal invasion. Putin could turn his intelligence agencies or related criminal gangs against US government departments, hospitals, critical infrastructure and utilities. Opening a cyber front, or at least hinting at one, would be consistent with Putin's strategy of escalation, which has seen him rattle nuclear sabers, turn fearsome fire on Ukrainian civilians and use new generation hypersonic missiles. But the key question is whether the Russian leader would risk a full-bore cyber conflict with Washington, which, as CNN reported last week, has fearsome capabilities of its own that may outmatch Russia's arsenal and could quickly deliver devastating hits against Russian critical infrastructure. Biden first warned on Monday in a written statement that it was time for the private sector, which owns much of the nation's critical infrastructure and hasn't always heeded government warnings, to immediately harden its online defenses. Then he took an even more chilling message in person to a Business Roundtable meeting in Washington. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it's coming,"" the President warned. ""He hasn't used it yet, but it's part of his playbook,"" Biden said of Putin. Anne Neuberger, White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said Monday that after detecting ""preparatory activity"" by Russia, the administration had held classified briefings with companies and sectors that could be vulnerable to cyberattacks. But she also said that there was currently no evidence of any specific threat. The White House has consistently warned of a potential cyber front of the Russian war on Ukraine ever since the invasion more than three weeks ago, over and above its regular guidance to state and local governments and big businesses and industry. Putin's motives to attack the US As always with government pronouncements based on intelligence -- and especially in an area as sensitive as potential cyberwarfare -- much remains unknown about the potential threat, the timing of Biden's announcement and the messages he sought to send to Russia with the statement on Monday. But Putin does have burning reasons for wanting to target the United States and inflict pain on Americans. Unprecedented international sanctions are having a devastating effect on the Russian economy. The longer they remain in force, the more they will hurt ordinary Russians. The Russian banking sector is cut off from the world, and the country has become an international pariah. Putin's forces, meanwhile, didn't pull off an expected blitzkrieg to Kyiv. A military stalemate may force Putin to escalate the crisis to increase his own geopolitical leverage with outside powers. And by his actions over many years, the Russian leader has given every impression that he believes he's already waging low intensity warfare against the West. Indeed, Russian intelligence agencies used hacking and influence campaigns in the 2016 and 2020 US elections, according to US intelligence. Putin may also be seeking revenge for the gusher of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons being poured into Ukraine by the West, which are being used to kill Russians in an extraordinary proxy war with Moscow in Europe. So the leap to direct, non-military action against the United States may not be as wide to Putin as it might appear to others. A long record of cyberwarfare Cyberattacks, though they would be an escalation in the current circumstances, would not be a new Russian tactic. Nearly a year ago, Washington blamed the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for the 2020 SolarWinds attack on federal servers and a broad sweep of the public sector and imposed sanctions. A criminal group originating from Russia, named ""DarkSide,"" was believed to be responsible for a ransomware cyberattack on the trans-America Colonial Pipeline last year. At a summit in Geneva last summer, Biden told Putin that certain areas of critical infrastructure should be off-limits for cyberattacks, and outlined 16 specific entities including energy and water. And in its just published Annual Threat Assessment report, the US Intelligence community warned that Russia was developing capabilities to target underwater cables and industrial control systems in the US and elsewhere ""because compromising such infrastructure improves and demonstrates its ability to damage infrastructure during a crisis."" Biden's multiple audiences The idea that Putin would not dare to initiate a cyber conflict with the United States may now be less compelling given the Russian President's dubious decision making in the war so far. Putin has blown through multiple barriers of acceptable behavior with his invasion of a sovereign, independent nation. His offensive has now degenerated into appalling air, artillery and missile attacks on civilians. Having thrown his domestic and international credibility at the war, he cannot afford to lose. That's one reason why the US has warned about the possibility of chemical or biological attacks by Russian forces and why there is deep concern among the community of atomic scientists that the Russians could eventually consider the use of smaller, tactical nuclear weapons as acceptable military doctrine. He could see cyberwarfare as just another deployable weapon. The power of Biden's warning -- even if cyberattacks are not imminent -- was cemented by the intelligence community's success so far in exposing and predicting the Russian military's actions. As more than 100,000 Russian troops massed around Ukraine earlier this year, some officials in Europe and even in Kyiv dismissed warnings that Putin was about to invade as contrary to Russia's own interests. The intelligence success not only contrasted with the community's failures on the Iraq war and ahead of the September 11, 2001 attacks. It also raised the possibility that the United States has strong visibility into the Russian regime. Biden's citing of unspecified, ""evolving intelligence"" on potential cyberattacks is the latest occasion when the US has deployed strategic nuggets of the product of US spy agencies to shape perceptions of the war in the US and abroad. An element of psychological warfare may be also at play given that Putin, a former KGB officer, would be furious at the possibility the US has breached Russian spy agencies. Biden puts big business on alert There is debate among cyberwarfare experts whether Putin would be deterred by the risk that the United States could strike back with even more force at Russia. An in-depth report by CNN's investigative unit last week found that while there have been smaller attacks on Ukrainian banks and government agencies, there has so far been no major cybersecurity disaster, like a blanket power outage, a poisoned water system or a crippled supply chain, in the US or Ukraine since the invasion. There was consensus among nearly 20 experts who spoke with CNN that while Russia is well positioned to launch catastrophic cyberattacks on the United States, it is not likely to do so. The experts believe that Putin understands his country's cyber capabilities are outmatched by those of the US. And Biden underscored again on Monday that the US would respond vigorously to any intrusions, seeking to bolster the deference factor. He vowed to ""use every tool to deter, disrupt, and if necessary, respond to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure."" Biden's statement was also a clear warning to US businesses to make a renewed effort to protect themselves from cyberhacking before it is too late. Some firms lack the capabilities of government to protect themselves. The cost of cybersecurity is particularly onerous for smaller businesses and vendors. US firms face cyberattacks every day that cost millions of dollars. But there was a real sense that Biden's statement was intended as a wake-up to the private sector that something much worse was on the way. As he put it: ""You have the power, the capacity and the responsibility to strengthen the cybersecurity and resilience of the critical services and technologies on which Americans rely.""",20,4.144737287024268,4.450938297501293,-0.3062010104770252,2
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/politics/putin-war-criminal-ukraine-russia-what-matters/index.html,Calling Putin a war criminal is a bigger deal than you think,"Airstrikes on an art school and a maternity hospital. Residential apartment buildings taking fire from tanks. More than 900 civilians killed in a matter of weeks. Is Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal? His country's unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine has presented reams of evidence that have led some world leaders -- including US President Joe Biden last week -- to use the loaded label. The question now is what Biden's comments -- which he followed up by calling Putin a ""murderous dictator"" and ""pure thug"" -- will mean for the war in Ukraine going forward. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday didn't signal any concern that Biden's remarks would roil talks with Russia. He told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that he's ""ready for negotiations"" with Putin. (More on this in a minute.) Biden's comments represented a major moment since leading officials had mostly avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. But soon after the President uttered the words ""I think he is a war criminal"" to reporters at an unrelated event, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the comment was ""from the heart."" Other officials used similar language. ""When you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you're seeing what we've all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it's hard not to walk away with that conclusion,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price later told CNN. And after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he ""personally"" agreed with Biden's label of Putin, Psaki told reporters that the top US diplomat was speaking from the heart ""as well."" Why all the parsing? While terms like ""war crimes"" and ""war criminal"" are often used colloquially, they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Conventions, which specify intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime. In other words, the White House is being careful to not get ahead of the international investigations probing Russia's invasion. Will Biden's words complicate Ukraine-Russia negotiations? The Kremlin called Biden's remarks about Putin being a war criminal ""absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable."" Asked if it would be hard to sit down with Putin, Zelensky maintained Sunday that he's ready -- and has been ready. ""I'm ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,"" he said on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" ""I think that we have to use any format, any chance, in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War."" Zelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia's invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks ""without delay,"" warning that otherwise Russia's losses would be ""huge."" The problem, as CNN's national security team reports, is that US and NATO officials believe Putin has not backed off his original demands in talks with Ukraine, and there is a heavy dose of skepticism in Western capitals about how credible Moscow's engagement truly is -- even as the status of those negotiations remains difficult to decipher, according to multiple sources briefed on the situation. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have met four times since the start of Russia's invasion. The view from the State Department. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Friday also expressed her personal view that war crimes are being committed in Russia, saying that they ""all feel it personally,"" but noted that there must be ""a body of proof"" before a legal determination can be made. ""I think there is virtually no one -- maybe Vladimir Putin is the exception -- who can look at all of the photographs, all of video coming from Ukraine and not believe that Putin is intentionally targeting civilians, and intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,"" she said in an interview with CNN's John Berman on ""New Day."" ""Now, I think we all feel it personally,"" Sherman said, ""but in terms of international law, you have to have evidence, you have to have a body of proof that in fact there was intentionality."" She added that the United States is ""helping to pull that evidence together, present it to international justice parties and then have a legal threshold that is met."" How long do war crime investigations take? Investigations at the International Criminal Court take many years, and only a handful of convictions have ever been won. Put differently, it could be a while before Biden's ""war criminal"" remarks have any legal weight -- if ever. As we noted earlier this month, the court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea. However, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia. That seems unlikely.",45,3.896253663787775,5.035835903195301,-1.1395822394075261,6
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/politics/us-russia-top-military-commander-ukraine-war/index.html,Who is Russia's top field commander in Ukraine? The US isn't sure.,"The US has been unable to determine if Russia has designated a military commander responsible for leading the country's war in Ukraine, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter — something that current and former defense officials say is likely a key contributor to the apparent clumsiness and disorganization of the Russian assault. Without a top, theater-wide commander on the ground in or near Ukraine, units from different Russian military districts operating in different parts of Ukraine appear to be competing for resources rather than coordinating their efforts, according to two US defense officials. Units participating in different Russian offensives across Ukraine have failed to connect, these sources say, and in fact, appear to be acting independently with no overarching operational design. Russian forces also appear to be having significant communication issues. Soldiers and commanders have at times used commercial cell phones and other unsecure channels to talk to each other, making their communications easier to intercept and helping Ukraine develop targets for their own counterstrikes. It's all led to what these sources say has been a disjointed — and at times chaotic — operation that has surprised US and western officials. ""One of the principles of war is 'unity of command,' said CNN military analyst retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a former commander of the US Army in Europe. ""That means someone has to be in overall charge— to coordinate fires, direct logistics, commit reserve forces, measure the success (and failure) of different 'wings' of the operation and adjust actions based on that."" Historically, there have been instances in which Russia has publicized this kind of information, but the Ministry of Defense has not made any reference to a top commander for operations in Ukraine and did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the topic. And while it is possible that Russia has quietly designated a top commander to oversee the invasion — even if the US has been unable to identify that individual — the state of combat operations would suggest ""he's inept,"" according to Hertling. The Russian invasion has also been marked by an inordinate number of casualties among high-ranking Russian officers. The Ukrainians say they have killed five Russian generals during the first three weeks of the war, a claim CNN has not independently confirmed. Still, any military general being killed in combat is a rare event, Retired US Army Gen. David Petraeus told CNN's Jake Tapper during Sunday's State of the Union. Col. Sergei Sukharev, the commander of an elite Russian airborne unit, was also killed in battle in Ukraine, Russian regional state TV network GTRK Kostroma reported Thursday. ""The bottom line is that their command and control has broken down,"" said Petraeus. The sheer size of the invasion has only made things worse. Coordinating operations along a front that measures over 1,000 miles requires ""extensive communication capability and command, control and intelligence resources that the Russians just don't have,"" Hertling added. ""I can't see that anything the navy is doing is coordinated with the anything the air force is doing or anything the land force is doing,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, another former commander of the US Army in Europe, who cautioned that he had no inside knowledge of the US understanding of Russia's command structure. ""The Russians have had tremendous difficulties with command and control during this operation at all echelons,"" echoed a US source familiar with the situation on the ground. ""Some of this may be due to actions by the Ukrainians themselves."" On the ground, Russian troops in the field have often been cut off from their senior commanders, sources said. ""The guys in the field go out and they have their objective, but they have no way to radio back [if something goes wrong],"" said another source familiar with the intelligence, who added that western officials believe this is part of the reason that some Russian troops have been observed abandoning their own tanks and armored personnel carriers in the field and simply walking away. A stalled campaign Since Russia launched its assault on Ukraine on Feb. 24, it has bombarded Ukrainian cities with missiles and artillery, destroying apartments, hospitals and schools and leaving scores of civilians dead. But its ground invasion has largely stalled amid fierce resistance from the Ukrainians and what senior defense officials have described as tactical errors. The airspace over Ukraine remains contested and Russia has failed to take control of any major cities, including Kyiv. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday told CNN's Don Lemon that the US has ""seen a number of missteps"" by Russia. Moscow has ""struggled with logistics,"" he said, adding that he has not seen evidence of ""good employment of tactical intelligence"" nor ""integration of air capability with a ground maneuver."" Both current officials and outside analysts point out that although Russia has deployed its military in other recent conflicts, including in Syria and in Crimea in 2014, it has not tried anything even remotely as ambitious as a full-scale invasion of a large nation like Ukraine that would require air and ground integration and coordinated effort by units from multiple different military regional districts. Russia rotates its annual military exercises between its regional military districts, Hodges said — rather than conducting the kind of so-called ""joint"" exercises that the United States routinely employs to ensure smooth coordination between disparate pieces of its sprawling military. ""They don't have any experience at this, not at this kind of a scale,"" he said. ""It's been decades since they would have done something on this scale. What they did in Syria and Crimea in 2014 is nothing compared to this."" And, he added, ""It doesn't seem to me that they've actually exercised this in a way that would have demonstrated that they would have to have a joint operational commander."" Putin's reliance on secrecy Some officials have also suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin kept planning for the overall operation so closely held within the Kremlin that many of his own military commanders in the field didn't fully understand the mission until the last minute — likely preventing different arms of Russia's military from coordinating effectively in the run-up to the invasion. ""In the assessments we see it is clear some people on the [Russian] defense side are not really understanding what the game plan is,"" a senior European official said in early February, just weeks prior to the invasion. The official added that the assessments suggest the defense personnel think ""it's a very difficult game plan to stand up."" The lack of central organization also has implications for Russia's efforts to resupply its forces. Moscow has struggled to provide sufficient food, fuel and munitions to troops in the field — and as its casualties have mounted, officials say there are indications that Russia is seeking to replenish its losses with both foreign fighters and existing Russian troops stationed elsewhere. Without a theater commander, strategic allocation of limited resources could prove challenging, Hodges said. ""That's the job of the joint force commander: to allocate priorities,"" he said. ""Who gets the priority for fuel, ammunition or particular capability.""",7,3.8587000415166948,3.3229111994898806,0.5357888420268142,9
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/europe/ukraine-monday-reset-03-21-intl/index.html,Seven key developments in the Ukraine conflict this weekend,"Civilian casualties continue to mount as a result of Russian attacks on Ukraine, and the besieged city of Mariupol has refused to surrender despite constant bombardment. Here are the key developments from the weekend. Ukrainian officials reject Russian request to surrender Mariupol Russian forces continued their assault on the southeastern city of Mariupol, striking an art school turned bomb shelter on Sunday. The city council put the number sheltering in the school building at 400, but Petro Andrushenko, an adviser to the city mayor, said it was not clear how many people were there. In a video message late Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there were no military positions near the art school. Most of the people sheltering there were ""women and children, the elderly. They are under the rubble. We do not know how many are alive now, but we know that the pilot who dropped that bomb will definitely be shot down,"" he said. Russia issued an ultimatum to city authorities to surrender before dawn Monday, but both the government in Kyiv and the Mariupol city authorities rejected the Russian terms. Zelensky said Sunday that Russia's actions in Mariupol were an ""act of terror that will be remembered for centuries."" Dozens of care home residents killed by Russian tank attack Fifty-six elderly residents of a care home in the eastern Ukrainian town of Kreminna were killed when a Russian tank opened fire on the facility, according to Serhii Haidai, the head of the Luhansk region. The attack happened on March 11, said Haidai, who added that 15 other residents of the care home had been abducted and taken to the town of Svatove in what is now Russian-occupied territory. CNN has been unable to independently verify the claim. Russia continues to attack civilian targets across Ukraine. At least 902 civilians have been killed and 1,459 injured since the start of the invasion, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said Sunday. Russia loses another general Ukrainian forces killed Russian General Oleg Mityaev of the 150th Motorized Rifle Division near Mariupol, according to a Telegram post shared by Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Interior Minister, last week. On Sunday, Aleksei Arestovich, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, told Ukraine's NV News that Mityaev ""most likely went to show, by example, how to fight. Because his soldiers refused to fight."" Neither the Russian Ministry of Defense nor Russian state media have issued any statements on his death. CNN cannot independently verify the Ukrainian claim. Ukrainian officials say a total of five Russian generals have been killed since the invasion began on February 24. If true, this would be an unusually high number of high-ranking soldiers to have been killed in three weeks of combat. In addition, a deputy commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was confirmed killed by two senior Russian officials on Sunday. Russia launches hypersonic missiles The Russian military claimed it had launched a series of strikes on military targets in Ukraine employing hypersonic and cruise missiles on Saturday night and Sunday morning. In a statement released on Sunday, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Igor Konashenkov said sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles were fired from the Caspian Sea, and air-launched Kinzhal hypersonic missile systems were fired from airspace over Crimea. US officials also confirmed to CNN that Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine last week, the first known use of such missiles in combat. The launches were likely intended to test the weapons and send a message about Russian capabilities, multiple sources told CNN. Rising concerns over risk of attack from Belarus On Sunday, Ukraine's General Staff said the threat of an offensive from Belarus into northwestern Ukraine is ""high,"" without providing additional details. ""The level of threat from the territory of Belarus in the direction of Volyn is evaluated as high,"" the military said in a statement via the presidential office, adding: ""Defense forces of Ukraine are ready to resist."" Ukraine's northwestern Volyn region borders Belarus to the north and Poland, a NATO member, to the west. It could serve as a gateway for attacking forces from the north to approach Lviv, a strategic city in western Ukraine. Lviv is a hub for both Ukrainian government logistics and relief efforts, as well as a transit point for many civilians looking to flee fighting in other parts of the country. The Russian military has already used Belarusian territory as a launchpad for its invasion of Ukraine, with forces staging an offensive push toward Kyiv and central Ukraine from southern Belarus. There is no direct evidence that Belarus' troops have participated in hostilities. Russia accused of detaining reporters, activists and officials On Saturday, Ukrainian digital broadcaster Hromadske said its reporter Victoria Roshchina had gone missing and was believed to be being held by Russian forces. Ukraine's human rights commissioner, Liudmyla Denisova, said Saturday the government believed she had been kidnapped by Russian forces in the town of Berdyansk, which lies on the Black Sea coast and is under Russian occupation. Roshchina's disappearance comes amid reports of other activists and officials being held against their will in other parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine. In Kherson region, Dmytro Vasyliev, a senior council official in the town of Nova Kakhovka, was abducted last week, according to the town's mayor. Human rights organization ZMINA said some 17 people had been abducted by Russian forces in Ukraine since the start of the war. Zelensky repeats call for NATO admission in CNN interview In an exclusive interview on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian President told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that he is ready to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""I'm ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations, we cannot end this war,"" said Zelensky, who also warned that failed negotiations could mean the fight between the two countries would lead to ""a third World War."" Zelensky told Zakaria that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if the country had been admitted into the NATO alliance. ""If we were a NATO member, a war wouldn't have started. I'd like to receive security guarantees for my country, for my people,"" said Zelensky. The Ukrainian president said he was grateful for military aid sent by the alliance, but he continued his push for NATO admission for his country. ""If NATO members are ready to see us in the alliance, then do it immediately because people are dying on a daily basis,"" he said.",47,4.210187837541945,5.257521648992571,-1.0473338114506268,25
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/europe/russia-ukraine-junkyard-weapons-intl-hnk/index.html,Inside the Kyiv junkyard that recycles Russian weapons for Ukrainian forces,"The sound of rockets launching in the distance breaks the silence of an otherwise quiet morning in Kyiv. ""That's us, we're attacking Russian positions close to Hostomel,"" a Ukrainian soldier says, as the shots fire in a synchronized rhythm. In this particular instance, the rockets the Ukrainian military is using to target Moscow's invading troops are actually Russian. ""Last night we sent the Ukrainian armed forces 24 Uragan missiles that were on their way here to fly over our cities,"" says Yuri Golodov, the deputy commander of one of Ukraine's Territorial Forces and a retired seaman from the Ukrainian Navy. ""We captured them intact, gave them to the Armed Forces of Ukraine at night and now the Ukrainian army has fired missiles back at them,"" Golodov says. Golodov plays a key role in repurposing military equipment abandoned by the Russian army -- or captured from it. He leads a team working at a military junkyard at an undisclosed location in Kyiv, repairing and repainting Russian military equipment for use by Ukrainian forces. ""Everything that we take away from the Russian army, we transfer to the armed forces of Ukraine,"" he says. A second life for damaged weapons When CNN visited the junkyard, Ukrainian forces were stripping bare an artillery support vehicle, used to spot targets. The Ukrainian flag had been painted over Russian military symbols, and Golodov's unit was removing communications equipment before sending it back onto the front line. ""We're going to use it to transport the wounded,"" he says, adding it will make an ""important"" contribution to Ukraine's war effort. ""This is a very proper cross-country vehicle. It can cope with any swamp or snow."" Much of the equipment used by the Russian military is similar or the same to that used by Ukrainian soldiers, so they're familiar with its operation. ""It dates back to the Soviet Union,"" Golodov says. ""It is quite reliable."" ""Everything is in working condition. It looks old weaponry, but actually if you use it correctly it will serve us for a long time,"" he adds. Golodov says his battalion is also responsible for capturing some of the equipment in the yard. ""We are special forces battalion of deep reconnaissance which works behind enemy lines,"" he explains. ""Our task is to destroy the provision of the Russian army -- ammunition, fuel, food."" Weapons seized from troops under fire Around the corner, a former Russian army fuel truck is ready to be redeployed and, under the cover of a camouflage blanket, a captured armored personnel carrier awaits its next assignment. It is old, rusty and heavy Soviet era machinery that breaks the pavement, as members of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces move it around, but the soldiers here say they will put it to good use. According to Golodov, the vehicle was captured by his unit, when they attacked a Russian column. ""We shot at the first vehicle, and when it exploded the column stopped,"" he says. ""(Russian soldiers) ran away and we took their military equipment."" According to Golodov and his men, this is a common occurrence on the battlefield. ""Russian soldiers are frightened, demoralized. They are afraid to part with each other, because they are being shot at from every bush,"" he says. He says some seem to be very young and inexperienced: ""Most of them do not know or understand why they are here."" Ukraine's Territorial Defense forces are equally green. Most didn't have any sort of military training before the Russian invasion, but the men say they are ready for battle. In another part of the facility, soldiers armed with AK-47s train for a possible encounter with Russian troops. They move in groups in an organized manner and seem unfazed when their commander fires blanks in their direction. Golodov looks on, proud. Before he retired from the navy, he says he spent time with the Soviet Union's north fleet in Mursmansk, northwestern Russia, and says he knows what Russian forces are capable of. He tells us he is not surprised by how well Ukraine has fared in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. ""The force of the Russian army is nothing more than a myth,"" he says, confident in a Ukrainian victory. ""How can someone possibly think otherwise?""",7,2.171426494399383,4.710300172826186,-2.5388736784268033,18
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/politics/biden-russia-cyber-activity/index.html,Biden warns business leaders to prepare for Russian cyber attacks,"President Joe Biden on Monday issued an urgent warning to American business leaders, telling them to strengthen their companies' cyber defenses immediately. Speaking at the Business Roundtable Quarterly Meeting in Washington, Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to use cyber attacks as a form of retaliation against the United States for its actions to counter Russia's incursion on Ukraine. Biden said, ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming."" He added that ""one of the tools (Putin's) most likely to use, in my view -- in our view -- is cyber attacks. They have a very sophisticated cyber capability,"" and later argued, ""The point is that he has the capability. He hasn't used it yet, but it's part of his playbook."" The President told business leaders the national interest is at stake, suggesting that it's ""a patriotic obligation that you invest as much as you can in making sure -- and we will help in any way -- that you have built up your technological capacity to deal with cyber attacks."" Earlier Monday, Biden issued a statement pointing to ""evolving intelligence"" to suggest Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against American companies and critical infrastructure. While the Biden administration has been warning the nation of the prospect of cyber attacks by Russia for months, most recently as a response to the economic restrictions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, the President's statement suggests ""evolving intelligence"" has heightened the threat. The details of exactly what that intelligence is remain unclear, but deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger said during Monday's White House briefing that Russia had been conducting ""preparatory activity"" for cyber attacks, which she said could include scanning websites and hunting for software vulnerabilities. Neuberger said the administration is reiterating its warnings ""based on evolving threat intelligence that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyber attacks on critical infrastructure in the United States,"" but also underscored that ""there is no certainty there will be a cyber incident on critical infrastructure."" The administration last week ""hosted classified briefings with companies and sectors we felt would be most effective and provided very practical, focused advice,"" Neuberger told CNN's Phil Mattingly during Monday's briefing. Biden said in his statement that the administration would ""continue to use every tool to deter, disrupt, and if necessary, respond to cyber attacks against critical infrastructure,"" but acknowledged that ""the federal government can't defend against this threat alone."" ""Most of America's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and critical infrastructure owners and operators must accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has been actively working with organizations across critical infrastructure to rapidly share information and mitigation guidance to help protect their systems and networks,"" the statement said. The administration is recommending several steps to help private sector partners prevent against cyber attacks, including using multi-factor authentication, consulting with cyber security professionals to make sure systems are protected against all known vulnerabilities, changing passwords across networks to prevent stolen credentials from being used, backing up and encrypting data and educating employees on cyber security. Concerns that Putin might lash out The decision for Biden to issue the warning reflects concerns within the administration about what Putin might be willing to do next as it becomes increasingly clear his invasion of Ukraine is not going as expected, according to a US official familiar with the internal discussions on cyber security. Biden officials have been discussing how the state of Russia's ground campaign might change Putin's calculus and how options are being considered in Russia as a result, the official said, noting the situation -- in some ways -- is more volatile than ever. Russia still maintains its cyber capabilities and the administration believes Putin may be more willing to use those tools as he gets more desperate, the official added. The official would not provide details about the kinds of options for potential cyber attacks the US believes Russia may be exploring, but there has been an increase in observed activity, according to a source familiar with the situation. The official said it is difficult to determine whether this is just noisy Russian activity meant to send a message to the US about what it could do or actual preparation of the environment. ""If you're Russia, disinformation doesn't seem to be working, they're not going to fire a shot at us, and so what's left is something in the middle: cyber,"" a second official added. The US departments of Energy, Treasury and Homeland Security, among others, have briefed big electric utilities and banks on Russian hacking capabilities, and urged businesses to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious activity. The FBI has been wary that Russian speaking ransomware groups could lash out at US businesses. While the administration has issued warnings about possible Russian hacking activity for months, when the statement comes from the President, ""it's generally because [the threat] has taken on additional significance in the eyes of the government,"" a third US official said. Ukrainian government agencies have been hit by a series of cyber attacks before and after the Russian invasion but not the level of hacking that some analysts feared. Cyber attacks have nonetheless played a supporting role in the war. As the Russian military began attacking Ukraine on February 24, satellite modems that provide internet service for tens of thousands of customers in Europe, including some in Ukraine, were taken offline in a cyber attack on US telecommunications provider Viasat. The US government is investigating the hack of Viasat as a potential Russian state-sponsored cyber attack, a US official familiar with the matter previously told CNN. Neuberger on Monday did not identify who was responsible for the hack. She said US officials continue to investigate the incident. Earlier in March, a bipartisan group of senators also shared their concerns with the Biden administration about the potential of widespread Russian cyberattacks in the US as retribution for harsh sanctions against Russia in the wake of President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Sunday evening obtained by CNN, 22 senators, led by Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen and South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, raised questions about America's readiness for Russian cyber and disinformation threats. Additional correspondence obtained by CNN indicated that DHS responded to the senators on Monday, saying that the CISA's Office of Legislative Affairs will work with the group to prepare a briefing on the matter.",20,6.6099066925229355,8.08732717081313,-1.4774204782901936,2
2022-03-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-20-intl/index.html,School where hundreds were believed to be sheltering is bombed in Mariupol as fighting rages for key port city,"An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol has said officials in the besieged Ukrainian city are struggling to find out exactly how many people survived after an art school was bombed by Russian forces on Sunday morning. ""So far, there is no exact operational data on how many people were hiding in the shelter or the number of casualties,"" Petro Andrushenko said in a social media post. ""I expect we will have it later today. But the situation is difficult and there is nowhere to get the data from."" Earlier, the city council said the building was acting as a shelter for an estimated 400 people. The information black hole reflects a similar lack of clarity about how many people survived an attack four days ago on a theater in Mariupol that was also being used as a shelter, possibly for up to 1,300 people. The number of people reported to have survived that bombing -- put at 130 -- has been unchanged for several days. It is indicative of the almost total collapse of basic services and communications in a city that is increasingly bearing the brunt of Russia's fierce assault on the country. ""The city continues to be shelled both from the sky and the sea,"" Andrushenko wrote on his Telegram channel Sunday. ""It seems the occupiers are so eager to wipe out Mariupol that they are ready to cover themselves with fire."" Four of the seven established humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol were operational on Sunday, according to Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, and almost 7,300 people were evacuated. Among them, 3,900 people were evacuated by buses and private transport from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine government and city officials rejected a call by the Russian Ministry of Defense for Mariupol authorities to surrender the city to Russian forces by 5 a.m. local time Monday, a move reported by the Russian state media outlet, RIA Novosti. ""There can be no discussion of any surrender or of laying down arms,"" said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk in an interview late Sunday. ""I have already informed the Russian side about it. I wrote: 'Instead of wasting your time to write an 8-page letter -- open the corridor,'"" Vereshchuk said, adding Ukraine has informed the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross and is ""awaiting a response from the international community. This is a conscious manipulation and true hostage taking."" Russia was offering to open humanitarian corridors to the city by 10 a.m. Monday and ""wants to receive a written response from Kiev to these proposals before 5:00,"" RIA Novosti reported, citing the head of Russia's National Center for Defense Management, Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev. ""From 10 am to 12 o'clock - for all armed units of Ukraine and foreign mercenaries is a temporary suspension of fighting along the route agreed with Ukraine. From 12 o'clock, there will be a simultaneous passage of humanitarian convoys with food, medicine and basic necessities,"" Mizintsev said, according to the report. Andrushenko said people trying to flee the city in their cars were being shot at by Russian forces. ""Evacuation is difficult -- difficult but moving. The Russians are doing everything to complicate things. Last night, cars trying to drive towards the village of Melekine [6 miles west of the city center] were fired upon."" Other residents looking to flee were having their cars seized from them at a checkpoint just outside Mariupol, he said. Meanwhile, Mariupol City Council said in a statement on Saturday night that residents of the city were being taken to Russian territories against their will by Russian forces. ""Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents have been taken to Russian territory. The occupiers illegally took people from the Livoberezhny district and from the shelter in the sports club building, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing,"" the statement read. According to Colonel-General Mizintsev almost 60,000 residents of Mariupol ""found themselves in Russia in complete safety,"" RIA Novosti reported. The city council said captured Mariupol residents were taken to camps where Russian forces checked their phones and documents, then redirected some of the residents to remote cities in Russia -- adding that the ""fate of the others is unknown."" The statement quoted Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko saying, ""What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people."" Oleg Nikolenko, Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, called Russia's action's in Mariupol on Sunday a ""chapter from WWII."" ""First they came to destroy the cities, bombing hospitals, theaters, schools, and shelters, killing civilians and children. Then they forcibly relocated the scared, exhausted people to the invader's land. A chapter from WWII? No -- the actions of the Russian army, today in Mariupol,"" Nikolenko tweeted. Three weeks of fighting have left much of Mariupol in ruins, with shopping centers, apartment blocks and infrastructure all severely damaged. Local officials estimate 80% of properties are damaged.",47,6.619067449284582,3.7739783001961427,2.8450891490884396,24

""It is hard to imagine that in the 21st century people can be forcibly taken to another country."" Earlier Saturday, a Ukrainian army commander told CNN that people in Mariupol risk their lives each time they emerge from underground bunkers and claimed the strategic port is facing the most intense fighting anywhere in the country. With Russia's assault in its fourth week, Major Denis Prokopenko, from the National Guard Azov Regiment, told CNN that air and land attacks on the city were now almost relentless. ""Usually, Mariupol is under fire during the whole day and night. Sometimes there (are) 30 minutes of silence, but then the city is again under attack (from) tanks, artillery, multiple rockets, and (aircraft) like bombers and helicopters,"" he said. More than 4,100 people, including 1,172 children, were evacuated Saturday from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia via humanitarian corridors, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior official in President Volodymyr Zelensky's office. Mariupol has been under siege for several weeks and has seen some of the worst attacks in the war since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February. These have included deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater, the losses from which are still unknown as the rescue operation continues. The city lies on a stretch of coast connecting the eastern region of Donbas with the Crimea peninsula, both of which have been under Russian control since 2014. Russian forces appear to be trying to take full control of the area to create a land corridor between the two regions, squeezing Mariupol with brutal military force. Russia has denied targeting civilians in Mariupol, blaming casualties on Ukrainian forces. Prokopenko said people in the city were now reluctant to leave their underground shelters even to get hold of essentials, meaning they were trying to drink less water and eat less food, only emerging to prepare hot meals. ""People are cooking food in the streets, risking their lives under the continuous shelling and bombing,"" the military commander said. ""The temperature is minus 5 degrees Celsius in the street."" Basic services like gas, electricity and water, are all out in the city. Bodies are being left in the street because there is either no one left to collect them, or it is simply too dangerous to try. Prokopenko said no one knew the exact number of people killed. ""Some people are buried under ruined buildings, buried alive,"" he said. Information about a huge attack three days ago on a theater in Mariupol being used as a shelter has been slow to emerge. An image taken Saturday by the Maxar satellite imagery provider shows about two-thirds of the Mariupol Drama Theater completely destroyed, with just the western facade still standing. The building, which also acted as the city's main humanitarian assembly station, was providing a temporary home to 800 to 1,300 people when it was hit, according to local officials. Still clearly visible in the picture is the Russian word for ""children"" painted in large letters on the ground in front of the entrance. He confirmed earlier reports that sustained Russian artillery fire made attempts to get survivors out of the building very difficult. Communications in the besieged city have been difficult for days and rescue work has been hampered by the danger of near-continuous shelling, according to reports from inside the city. Initial reports suggested many survivors had to dig themselves out of the rubble. Figures released by several Ukrainian leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, say 130 people have been rescued, among them one person with serious injuries. During a video call with the Ukrainian Minister of Culture Oleksandr Tkachenko on Friday, Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini offered to help rebuild the Mariupol Drama Theater. Zelensky thanked Franceschini on Twitter Wednesday saying that Italy ""set a good example to follow. Together we will rebuild the country to the last brick.""",47,3.3864763888540597,3.9760639730100573,-0.5895875841559977,24

Here's how allies are providing assistance,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has implored Western allies to provide his country with military aid as Russia continues its unprovoked invasion. ""We need you right now,"" Zelensky told US members of Congress in one of his latest pleas for assistance before a friendly government. The US and other NATO member nations have fulfilled a number of Zelensky's requests, while stopping short of certain measures they say could risk an escalation in the war. Weapons assistance The military aid provided to Ukraine so far includes weapons that range from portable drones to complex, long-range missile systems. Switchblade drones. Small, portable, so-called kamikaze drones that carry warheads and detonate on impact. The smallest model can hit a target up to six miles away, according to the company that produces the drones, AeroVironment. It's unclear which size model the US will send to Ukraine. Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. These heat-seeking, anti-aircraft missiles have a range of about five miles and 11,000 feet. Critically, Stinger missiles can distinguish between enemy and friendly aircraft. Javelin anti-tank weapons. This guided missile system can be shoulder-fired by a single solider and has a range of up to 8,200 feet. AT-4 anti-armor systems. These Swedish anti-armor weapons are ""lightweight, single-shot and fully disposable,"" according to the company that produces them, Saab Bofors Dynamics. Patriot air defense missile system. The US also delivered two missile defense systems to Poland this month intended to deter Russia and boost Poland's security amid Western concerns that the Ukraine conflict could spill into NATO-aligned nations. The Patriot air defense missile system -- Patriot stands for ""Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target"" -- is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, advanced aircraft and cruise missiles. The battery includes missiles and launching stations, a radar set that detects and tracks targets, and an engagement control station, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance. Other actions Beyond military aid to Ukraine, the US and its NATO allies have issued a slew of sanctions against Russia. Putin. The United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada have announced they would introduce sanctions targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. SWIFT. The US, EU, UK and Canada have banned certain Russian banks from SWIFT, the high-security network that facilitates payments among 11,000 financial institutions in 200 countries. 'Most favored nation' status. The House of Representatives has passed a bill to suspend normal trade relations with Russia. The final vote was 424-8 with strong bipartisan support for the legislation, which next heads to the Senate. Energy and oil. EU officials said the bloc would slash imports of Russian natural gas by two-thirds this year, and the EU announced a plan to achieve energy independence from Moscow ""well before 2030."" That would separate Europe from its single biggest energy supplier. Separately, President Joe Biden announced a ban on Russian oil, natural gas and coal imports to the United States. And the UK government said Tuesday it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 and explore ways of ending natural gas imports as well. Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Germany has halted certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline following Moscow's actions. Unfulfilled Ukrainian requests As Russia's deadly invasion has continued, Zelensky has requested some actions that Western allies fear would put them in direct conflict with the Kremlin and escalate the war. No-fly zone. Zelensky has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to establish a no-fly zone over the country. A no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of a conflict such as the one in Ukraine, it would probably mean a zone in which Russian planes were not allowed to fly, to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes against Ukraine. The problem with military no-fly zones is that they have to be enforced by a military power. If a Russian aircraft flew into a NATO no-fly zone, then NATO forces would have to take action against that aircraft. Those measures could include shooting the plane from the sky. That would, in Russia's eyes, be an act of war by NATO and would likely escalate the conflict. S-300 missile defense systems. This surface-to-air missile system can strike targets that are both higher in altitude and farther away than Stinger missiles are designed for. Slovakia has preliminarily agreed to provide Ukraine with a key Soviet-era air defense system to help defend against Russian airstrikes, according to three sources familiar with the matter. But the US and NATO are still grappling with how to backfill that country's own defensive capabilities, and the transfer is not yet assured. MiG fighter jets. Earlier this month, the US dismissed a proposal from Poland to transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to the United States for delivery to Ukraine. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the US did not believe Poland's proposal was ""tenable"" and that it was too risky. ""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said.",49,6.7125219864884915,3.98938097725818,2.7231410092303117,21

In offering an assessment of Russia's troops, Austin told CNN's Don Lemon in an exclusive interview, conducted in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, that the Russians ""have not progressed as far as quickly as they would have liked."" Austin told CNN that the Russians have ""struggled with logistics"" and that he has not seen evidence of ""good employment of tactical intelligence,"" nor ""integration of air capability with a ground maneuver."" ""There are a number of things that we would expect to have seen that we just haven't seen. And the Russians really have had some -- has presented us some problems. So, many of their assumptions have not proven to be true as they entered this fight,"" he said. Since the invasion Ukraine began nearly a month ago, Russian troops have bombarded and destroyed large parts of cities, including Mariupol and Kharkiv, but Ukraine has been able to prevent Russia taking large swathes of the country, including the capital of Kyiv. ""I think (Russia) envisioned that they would move rapidly and very quickly seize the capital city. They've not been able to do that,"" the Pentagon chief said. In the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance to its invasion, Russia is also coping with low troop morale and struggling to resupply the thousands of troops in the country, US and NATO officials told CNN this week. Austin was also asked about China's position on the war. Russia has also requested military support and economic assistance support from China, two US officials told CNN this week. China has conveyed some openness to offering help to Russia, according to a US diplomatic cable to allies. Both Russia and Beijing have denied that there have been any such requests. On Friday, President Joe Biden sought to dissuade China's President Xi Jinping from assisting Russia, warning his Chinese counterpart during a 110-minute long video call of the ""implications and consequences"" for Beijing if it were to provide material support to Moscow. Austin told CNN that it's ""hard to say"" what China will do and declined to speculate. ""I would hope that China would not support this despicable act by Putin, I would hope that they would recognize a need to respect sovereign territory,"" he told CNN, adding that, ""We've been clear that if they do that, we think that's a bad choice."" Meanwhile, the US has supplied Ukraine with financial and military aid in its fight against Russia, including an additional $800 million in security assistance that Biden announced this week, but has stopped short of helping operate a no-fly zone over Ukraine as it seeks to avoid being directly involved in the conflict. Austin told CNN that Biden has ""been very clear about the fact that we won't have troops engaged in combat with Russia in Ukraine."" The defense secretary said that if the US were to put into place a no-fly zone, it would require controlling the skies, engaging Russian aircraft, and taking out aircraft systems in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. ""So that would mean that we're in combat with Russia. These are two nuclear powered countries that nobody wants to see engage in the conflict. It's not good for the region. It's not good for the world,"" he said. He said the US is focused on providing the type of assistance to Ukraine that ""we know are making a difference"" and doing ""everything within our power to defend every inch of NATO territory."" In a news conference Saturday in Sofia, Bulgaria, Austin said that Russia continues to make ""incremental gains"" in Ukraine's south and that Russia has used ""brutal, savage techniques'' in the way it has targeted civilians in Ukraine. ""Putin's war of choice against Ukraine has been tragic. Russia's invasion has taken a terrible toll on Ukrainian lives, including brave soldiers and far too many innocent civilians. Yet, Russia's aggression has galvanized the Ukrainian people, NATO, and the free world,"" Austin said in a joint news conference with Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov. Austin traveled to Europe this week, stopping in Belgium for the NATO Defense Ministerial before visiting Slovakia and Bulgaria as part of a trip to bolster NATO allies.

2022-03-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/europe/air-superiority-ukraine-russia-intl-cmd/index.html,How long can Ukraine hold out in the war for the skies?,"Of all the surprises that President Vladimir Putin has encountered since he invaded Ukraine last month, perhaps the biggest has been that Russia is yet to gain air superiority. On paper, Russia's military prowess implies that along with quick ground victories, the Russian air force should have been able swiftly to take control of the skies. Going into the conflict, Russia's 1,391 aircraft to Ukraine's 132 -- complemented by 948 helicopters to Kyiv's 55 -- have yet to give Putin the kind of aerial dominance required to eliminate Ukraine's resistance. Russia's overall defense budget of $45.8 billion is almost 10 times that of its neighbor. Experts ranging from former air force personnel to government officials believe that Russia's failure comes down to a combination of poor preparation by Moscow, a clever use of resources based on intelligence by Ukraine and the targeted donations of arms from Western allies to Ukraine. ""As far as I understand, they were able to save a large part of their air force by moving planes from airfields before the Russians destroyed them, based on intelligence ahead of attacks,"" says Gen. Riho Terras, a former commander of the Estonian Defense Forces. Sophy Antrobus, research associate at Freeman Air and Space Institute and former officer in the UK's Royal Air Force, agrees that in the early stages of the war, Ukraine appeared to take intelligent steps that are now paying dividends. ""They've been clever in that they didn't deploy all of their resources that could take down Russian aircraft. This possibly led Russia into a false sense of security, and Ukraine has been able to keep defending its air while reinforcements from allies arrive,"" she says. Those reinforcements include S-300 anti-aircraft systems, Stingers and Javelin missiles that have been used by Ukraine so far. The presence of such missile systems marks a dramatic upgrade for Ukraine. Rep. Mike McCaul, the ranking member on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee told CNN that S-300s, which are Russian-made, have ""higher-altitude"" capability than Stinger missiles, which the US has also sent to Ukraine. ""The S-300s are the high-altitude -- sort of like our Patriot battery of missiles -- anti-aircraft system. The fact that they are in country and more are coming is going to be very effective."" While these missile systems might be effective, there is still a question mark over how long Ukraine can hold off Russia -- both in the air and on the ground. High risk to Russia It remains the case that Russia's military is much larger, that NATO is unwilling to get directly involved or set up a no-fly zone and that, the longer the war drags on, the more Ukraine will rely on its allies to provide lethal weapons. How long it lasts depends in part on how much Putin is willing to throw at winning the conflict -- and whether he wants to repeat the tactics used by Russian forces in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against rebels in his country's civil war, Antrobus says. ""Is he willing to emulate Aleppo and commit atrocities so visible to the rest of the world? The worst days of the war in Syria came years into the conflict, and sadly people were just paying less attention. This conflict is only three weeks old,"" she says. If Putin were willing to go to the extremes seen in Syria, Antrobus points out, it would come with a much higher risk to Russia, ""because of the anti-aircraft weaponry Ukraine has and is being supplied with."" Russia must consider its medium-long term, she points out: how much in terms of equipment and personnel are they willing to lose at the cost of other interests. ""Placing his own fighters in that level of danger and burning through Russian resources while doing so will be very hard to justify,"" she says. What would be a tolerable and sustainable loss to control Ukraine's skies is also an unknown. Justin Bronk, airpower and technology research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, doesn't believe that Russia can ""attain meaningful air superiority over most of the country without taking unsustainable losses."" ""There has been little evidence shown that the Russian air force is capable of the large-scale complex air operations that this task would require."" Russia's battle for Ukraine's skies is in some respects also reliant on what parts of the ground it controls. Terras says that as long ""as Russia is still launching most of its attacks from outside of Ukraine, they are limited in how much of Ukraine's enormous airspace they can realistically dominate."" This means that Russia is, in many cases, having to launch bombers from outside Ukraine's borders in order to carry out missile strikes against targets inside Ukraine. Terras adds that Ukrainian forces have so far been wise in selecting which strategic parts of the country to defend. No-fly zone plea The other unknown when it comes to how long this war will last is how long Ukraine's allies can realistically keep providing weapons that the Ukrainian forces are trained to use. Many of the weapons sent, including the S-300s that McCaul told CNN had arrived in Ukraine as of Wednesday, are from the Soviet era and it's unknown how readily they can be resupplied. Ukraine has owned S-300s for years, CNN previously reported. Slovakia has preliminarily agreed to send more supplies into the country. CNN also previously reported that the US was trying to determine which countries could send S-300s into Ukraine. NATO has made clear many times that it will not provide a no-fly zone above Ukraine because it doesn't want to get dragged into a NATO-Russia war. The US has discouraged eastern European countries like NATO member Poland from sending weapons for the same reason. Poland had initially proposed giving all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force's Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. However, the US administration quickly called the idea ""untenable,"" because flying the jets from a US and NATO base ""into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" according to Pentagon press secretary John Kirby. This is where the optimism of those who have watched Ukraine defend itself hits a major road bump. Even as the US pledges an additional $800 million in security assistance, the West's hesitancy to get directly involved leaves the hardest parts of the job solely up to Ukraine. ""We must deliver more ground-based and air-based defenses that Ukrainians are trained to use. We must consider handing over the Soviet-era planes. There are perfectly good fighter jets sat around Europe that Ukraine is able to use to defend itself,"" says Terras. How far the Western alliance is willing to go in supplying this sort of equipment is dependent on politics. The extent to which Ukraine can credibly defend its skies will rely on how far the Western alliance is willing to go. And how long Putin can justify his costly war will be determined by how long Ukraine can credibly defend its skies. The Ukrainians have done a remarkable job so far in resisting the Russian onslaught. But as the conflict drags on, the fate of the defenders will be left in the hands and patience of others.",49,2.7899999664346815,5.743480584670505,-2.9534806182358233,21
2022-03-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/europe/russian-casualties-ukraine-military-readiness/index.html,Mounting Russian casualties in Ukraine lead to more questions about its military readiness,"Thousands of Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began nearly one month ago, US and NATO officials told CNN this week, and Russia is now struggling to resupply those forces as it faces sagging troop morale and fierce Ukrainian resistance. Russia's offensive to capture Kyiv has largely stalled, NATO officials said, and on Thursday Ukraine said it launched a counteroffensive aimed at gaining decisive control of the city's suburbs. US and allied intelligence assessments vary widely as to exactly how many Russian forces have been killed to date, sources familiar with the intelligence tell CNN. But even the lowest estimates are in the thousands. One such assessment found that approximately 7,000 Russian troops have been killed so far, said one of the sources. But that figure, first reported by The New York Times, is on the higher end of US estimates, which vary because the US and its allies have no precise way of counting casualties. Some estimates place the number of Russian troops killed in Ukraine at about 3,000, whereas others suggest more than 10,000 have been killed. So far, the number has been calculated largely via open source reporting from non-governmental organizations, the Ukrainian government, commercial satellite imagery, and intercepted Russian communications. US officials have also extrapolated numbers of dead based on the number of Russian tanks that have been destroyed, the sources said. Regardless of the precise number, US and western intelligence officials have observed that Russia is having difficulty replacing its forces, which is having a significant impact on Russian troop morale, senior NATO officials said on Wednesday. ""It becomes more evident every day that Putin gravely miscalculated,"" a senior NATO intelligence official told reporters at NATO headquarters on Wednesday night, speaking on the condition of anonymity to disclose sensitive assessments. ""Russia continues to face difficulties replacing its combat losses, and increasingly seeks to leverage irregular forces, including Russian private military corporations and Syrian fighters."" A senior NATO military official echoed that assessment, saying that ""we can assess that more private military companies will be engaging"" in the conflict soon. But in general, he said, the losses have had ""a bad effect on the morale of the troops."" ""We can see [Putin] miscalculated the resilience and the resistance of the Ukrainians,"" the NATO military official said. ""That is a fact. He did not see that. And that is a big surprise for him. And therefore he has had to slow down."" Flagging Russian morale The NATO intelligence official added, citing the Ukrainian General Staff, that ""Russian servicemen are increasingly refusing to travel to Ukraine, despite promises of veteran status and even higher salaries."" He noted that NATO expects that ""the reportedly high Russian casualties will also stir some reaction in Russia, as the Russian people eventually become aware of the extent of their losses."" A senior US defense official told reporters Thursday that the Pentagon has anecdotal evidence that Russian morale is flagging. ""We don't have insight into every unit and every indication. But we certainly have picked up anecdotal indications that morale is not high in some units,"" the official said. ""Some of that is, we believe, a function of poor leadership, lack of information that the troops are getting about their missions and objectives, and I think disillusionment from being resisted as fiercely as they have been."" In some instances, Russian troops have simply abandoned broken down vehicles in the field, walking away and leaving behind tanks and armored personnel carriers, according to two US officials. A congressional source briefed on the intelligence similarly said the US has assessed that there appears to be a gap between what Russian troops were prepared for and what they actually encountered. Many Russians captured so far have said they did not expect, for example, that they would be fighting a war in Ukraine, and believed they were just part of a military exercise. The Russian military leaders' commitment, however, appears to still be high, the congressional source said. Last week, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told a congressional committee in a public hearing that the US intelligence community's assessment of Russian troop deaths was between 2,000 and 4,000. He said the assessment was made with low confidence and based on both intelligence sources and open-source material. US and western intelligence officials broadly acknowledge that the will to fight is often difficult to measure and it is unclear how much sagging morale has contributed to Russia's sluggish progress on the battlefield. But open-source reporting for weeks has documented signs of discontent and low morale amongst ground troops, and one official speculated that one of the reasons Russian generals have been operating in higher-risk, forward operating positions is an effort to gin up flagging troops. Western officials say at least three Russian generals have been killed by Ukrainian forces since the war began. The problem may also extend to Russia's elite air units, the official said. ""They've lost a bunch of planes,"" this person said. ""That really affects pilot morale."" Russia is also behind in its desired timeline, the senior NATO military official said on Wednesday. Putin was hoping to expand Russian control over Ukraine all the way west to the Moldovan border by now, the official said, in order to link up with more Russian troops and attempt to encircle Kyiv. There are pro-Russian troops stationed in Transnistria -- a breakaway state in Moldova -- who ""are in a way, prepared"" to join the war, the official said. But they have not yet done so because the regular Russian forces have not yet made substantial progress westward, he said. Despite all of the losses, the senior NATO intelligence official said the alliance considers that Putin is still ""unlikely to be deterred, and may instead escalate. He likely remains confident that Russia can militarily defeat Ukraine.""",7,2.8788159098876305,4.293824657436594,-1.4150087475489634,9

""After an awful night of not knowing, we finally have good news from Mariupol on the morning of the 22nd day of the war. The bomb shelter [of the theatre] was able to hold. The rubble is beginning to be cleared. People are coming out alive,"" the former Donetsk region head Sergiy Taruta wrote in a Facebook post Thursday. He later told Ukrainian television that rescue efforts were being hindered by the complete breakdown of social services in the city and the dangers of further Russian attacks. It was not yet clear whether all those who sheltered in the theater had survived. Taruta said on Thursday that 1,300 people were in the building when it was bombed and 130 have so far been rescued. ""People are doing everything themselves. My friends went to help, but due to constant shelling it was not safe. People are clearing away the rubble themselves. There is no rescue operation, because all the services that are supposed to rescue people, to treat them, to bury them, these services no longer exist,"" Taruta told Ukrainian television. Liudmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian Parliament's commissioner for Human Rights, said earlier on Thursday that adults and children were coming out alive but the full extent of the impact remained unclear. ""In Mariupol, the release of civilians from the rubble of the drama theater has begun. The building withstood the impact of a high-powered air bomb and protected the lives of people hiding in the bomb shelter. Work is underway to unlock the basement,"" Denisova said in a statement on Telegram. However, she said there was ""currently no information about the dead or wounded under the rubble of the theater,"" and called the attack ""an act of genocide and a terrible crime against humanity as defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."" After the bombing on Wednesday, Mariupol City Council shared an image of the building and said Russian forces had ""purposefully and cynically destroyed the Drama Theater in the heart of Mariupol."" The word ""children"" was spelled out on two sides of the theater before it was bombed, according to satellite images. Ukraine's Minister of Defense Oleskii Reznikov said on Thursday that the Russian who carried out the bombing was a ""monster,"" and stressed the presence of children in the building. ""You can see from the maps, from the drones that around this theater, big letters of 'children' were written so that the pilot of the plane which was throwing the bombs could see 'children', and still, in spite of that, this monster has bombed the theater,"" Reznikov told the European Parliament via video link. Russia has denied its forces hit the building and instead accused ""militants of the nationalist 'Azov' battalion"" of blowing up the theater. The Azov battalion started as a volunteer militia linked to far-right ideologies before it was incorporated into a Ukrainian National Guard unit in 2014. Maxim Kach, a Mariupol city government official, said the building was for civilians, with only women and young children hiding within it and not military personnel, while an adviser to the government said it was the largest shelter in Mariupol. The onslaught on the city has led to a desperate humanitarian crisis. More than 350,000 residents continue to hide in shelters and basements to escape the ""continuous shelling by Russian occupation forces,"" with an average of 50 to 100 air strikes hitting the city each day causing enormous destruction, its city council said Thursday on Telegram. It estimates about ""80% of the city's housing structures are destroyed and 30% irreparably lost."" Residents who escaped the city told CNN conditions were ""unbearable"" and ""hell,"" with constant shelling, reports of people being held captive in a hospital and residents left without water, electricity or heat. Earlier this week a pregnant woman and her newborn baby died after a maternity hospital in Mariupol was bombed. CNN earlier reported that at least three people -- including a child -- died following the attack last week. Previous attempts to evacuate Mariupol have failed, but a planned evacuation went ahead on Thursday, with 800 private cars with more than 2,000 people making it through Russian-occupied territory to the city of Zaporizhzhia by mid-evening, according to Iryna Vereshchuk, the Ukrainian Minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories. A total of 30,000 people have managed to leave the besieged city, the city's council said Thursday.",47,6.894036094734783,5.5402502820471184,1.353785812687665,24
2022-03-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/politics/us-nato-errant-drones-unintentional-conflict-russia-ukraine/index.html,Drones flying into NATO territory have forced the alliance to decide how to respond -- if at all -- to incidents inside its borders,"Last week, a drone flew more than 350 miles beyond Ukraine's western border before crashing in Croatia, a NATO member country. The drone was carrying a bomb, Croatian officials said, and it's still not clear whether it belonged to Ukrainian or Russian forces. Another drone recently entered the airspace of Romania, south of Ukraine. And on Tuesday, Ukraine's military said it shot down a Russian drone that had reentered Ukraine through Polish airspace. The trio of drone incidents has amplified concerns that Russia's war in Ukraine could spill over into NATO countries, even if unintentionally, forcing the alliance to decide how to respond -- if at all -- to incidents that occur inside its borders. US defense officials say the errant drones that entered NATO territory appeared to be largely inadvertent. Since the start of Russia's invasion, the US military has established a deconfliction line with Russia to reduce the risk of miscalculation and make sure the two militaries operating so close together don't inadvertently clash. The US has tested the line ""once or twice a day,"" according to a senior defense official, but so far, it hasn't been needed. But NATO has tried unsuccessfully to connect with Russia via a deconfliction hotline and written letters, raising concerns about Russia's willingness to engage as the invasion of Ukraine has spread further west toward NATO territory, senior NATO military officials said on Wednesday. ""We are trying to communicate with them of course,"" one of the officials told reporters in a briefing at NATO headquarters. ""But it requires two [sides] to communicate."" Russia brought the fight closer to NATO's doorstep last weekend with precision-guided missile strikes near Lviv in western Ukraine, targeting a military training facility just 10 miles from Poland's border. Those attacks came one day after Russian officials threatened convoys that are providing weapons to Ukraine from the West, though a senior US defense official said the facility was not being used for security shipments. The US military has surveillance tools and sensors to help mitigate a potential escalation, including the capability to pick up radar emissions and infrared signatures of missile launches out of Russia or Belarus. US officials can then analyze the expected trajectory and try to keep an eye on it -- so if it diverts, there is an understanding if it's deliberate or accidental, defense officials said. While the US and NATO have stopped drone surveillance flights inside Ukraine, the US military is flying surveillance drones and U-2 aircraft along the border, as well as using satellites overhead, according to the officials. NATO is routinely flying its Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft near Ukraine as well. Patriot air defense systems have also been deployed to Poland to aid in responding to projectiles that could enter NATO airspace. ""There's lots and lots of drones flying around and so everybody's kind of looking over their shoulder nervously at what's going on,"" said Tom Karako, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Given the scale of what Russia is undertaking here, this sort of thing is not surprising. It's one of the reasons that everyone is wired so tight right now."" A risk for accidents Tensions over the prospect of Russian drones or bombs spilling into NATO territory come as the Biden administration has drawn a careful line about what it's willing to do to help Ukraine fight the Russians. The US and NATO have provided Ukraine with hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance, including anti-air and anti-tank missiles, but the Biden administration has opposed a plan that involved the US delivering Polish fighter jets to Ukraine through a German air base, warning it would be escalatory. US and NATO officials have also made clear they are not planning to deploy any troops to Ukraine. But amid commitments from President Joe Biden and other top officials to defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory, US and NATO officials are ramping up surveillance and patrols near the alliance's border with Ukraine and in order to guard against any unintentional escalation. ""We are stepping up our vigilance, our presence, the way we monitor our airspace,"" NATO's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said at a news conference this week. ""We are both increasing the capabilities we have to monitor to track, but also to ensure that we are able to react if needed."" Stoltenberg pointed to new Patriot air defense missile batteries that have been deployed along the alliance's eastern flank. The drone incidents, he said, ""highlights that with more military activities in the air, with drones and planes, there is a risk, for instance, accidents."" ""Therefore, we need to be extremely vigilant, we need to react when needed and we need to make sure that we have the communications, the line of communications also with the Russians to prevent an instance from really creating dangerous situations,"" Stoltenberg said. Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a national security and military analyst for CNN, said drones can veer off course if a pilot loses control, and the unguided missiles that Russia uses can miss a target, with a range that raises the possibility of entering NATO territory, especially if Russian forces move further into western Ukraine. But in any incident that might involve NATO airspace or territory, Hertling said, the key to avoiding escalation is communicating. ""The details matter, and when a NATO country is affected, we'd better get the details from Russia,"" he said. ""And it better be quick, because that's an escalatory move, too."" Eyes on the skies The Russian drone the Ukrainian military said it shot down after coming from Polish air space had appeared to be surveilling the military training center that Russia attacked on Sunday, according to the Wall Street Journal. Croatia's defense minister Mario Banozic said the drone that crashed in an urban part of Zagreb flew through three NATO countries after leaving Ukrainian airspace, according to the Associated Press. While the defense minister said the drone was armed with an explosive device, Stoltenberg told reporters it appeared to be unarmed. ""There are elements that indicated it could have come from both"" Ukraine and Russia, Bonozic said. Stoltenberg said that the NATO's air and missile defenses tracked the ""the flight path of an object"" that had entered Romanian airspace on Sunday, and Romanian fighter aircraft scrambled to investigate. He said NATO was reviewing both the Romanian and Croatian incidents. The current assessment of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, officials said, is that ""currently there is no threat to NATO as such. Not a deliberate threat by Russia. Russia is occupied for the time being with Ukraine."" But there are of course risks, the officials added, which is why there are now discussions about moving NATO's defensive systems further east. ""As we have now seen that Russia is prepared to use again, in the middle of Europe, military means to achieve political goals, it is worthwhile, and it will be discussed, to move forward the integrated air and missile defense system to cover the areas that are adjacent to Russia,"" one of the officials said. Those areas include Belarus and potentially Ukraine, he added. Jeff Edmonds, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security and former director for Russia on the National Security Council, said the risk to NATO territory will only increase as Russian forces move further west -- and closer to the delivery of weapons that NATO is providing to Ukrainian forces. ""If and when they make progress toward the west, the more they'll probably feel they have the freedom of maneuvering to engage things coming across the border,"" Edmonds said of Russian forces. ""One scenario here is that Russia strikes -- not really caring what side of the border -- as long as it hits the target, figuring they can call the bluff of the US and NATO not calling for a full-fledged war."" Asked about Poland's call on Wednesday to send NATO forces into Ukraine on a ""peacekeeping"" mission, the NATO military officials suggested such a plan would be untenable. ""We are looking at two nation states that are in a war. If they agree on a reliable and robust peace settlement, I do not necessarily see a need for a peacekeeping mission,"" one of the officials said. ""And if you are looking at the other version of 'peacekeeping,' which is actually 'peace enforcement,' I mean, that is war with Russia."" ""We would then have to 'protect,'"" the official explained, ""and then shoot, and then kill, and then destroy.""",49,4.677463313357191,4.04466384096684,0.6327994723903512,26
2022-03-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/europe/putin-speech-russia-ukraine-conflict-intl-cmd/index.html,Putin's chilling warning to Russian 'traitors' and 'scum' is a sign things aren't going to plan,"Western leaders and security agencies are spending huge amounts of resources on getting into Russian President Vladimir Putin's head. It's a futile exercise -- at times when the West has thought Russia's war in Ukraine might be losing steam, Putin has doubled down, sending his forces to bomb maternity hospitals and shelters harboring children. Now, an apparent pause in the advancement of Russian troops has the West guessing: Has Russia's war effort stalled? Or is it a tactical regrouping? Either way, an incendiary Stalinesque speech on Wednesday night in which Putin called Russians opposing the war ""traitors"" marked a change in tone and a sign that not all is going to plan, experts said. Perhaps more worrying, many observers saw it as a sign that the head of the Russian state, facing setback in Ukraine, would take a vengeful turn at home and crack down more forcefully than ever on any sign of dissent. While some Russians support the war, many others are protesting against it in the streets, fully aware they will be rounded up by heavily armed police even for the most peaceful of demonstrations. The Russian state has made mass protests illegal, and now, insulting the military is against the law. Still, people show up in groups, while others demonstrate entirely alone. Even lone protesters have been detained, social media videos have shown. A journalist who jumped on camera on a state-controlled news program, holding an anti-war sign, has become a cause célèbre for free speech in Russia. A renowned ballerina has left the Bolshoi. Russian prisoners of war are calling Putin out for using propaganda to justify the war. Putin, who has enjoyed consistently high ratings in Russia, is now turning to a strategy of intimidation to keep Russians on side, experts said. His speech Wednesday hinted darkly that those Russians who do not side with him were, in essence, traitors -- chilling words in a country where mass political repressions and the Gulag system are still within living memory. ""The West will try to rely on the so-called fifth column, on national traitors, on those who earn money here with us but live there. And I mean 'live there' not even in the geographical sense of the word, but according to their thoughts, their slavish consciousness,"" Putin said. The ""fifth column"" usually refers to sympathizers of the enemy during a war. ""Such people who by their very nature, are mentally located there, and not here, are not with our people, not with Russia,"" Putin said, mocking them as the type that ""cannot live without oysters and gender freedom."" ""But any people, and even more so the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors, and simply spit them out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths, spit them out on the pavement,"" he said. For Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political analysis firm R. Politik, Putin's speech proved the leader's plan has derailed. ""It seems to me that everything is starting to crumble with Putin. This speech of his is despair, strong emotion, impotence,"" she wrote on her official Telegram account. Pointing to the situation in Russia, Stanovaya argues that Putin is losing the battle of popularity, too. ""This is the beginning of the end. Yes, they will twist everyone's elbows, lock them up, imprison them, but it is already all without a future ... Everything will crack and slip."" Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said Putin's speech reflected how isolated the Russian leader had become. ""What we saw as the war began, and what we have seen since -- including last night's speech -- is really the result of a man whose entire world takes place inside his head,"" Braw told CNN, explaining how Putin had isolated intensely during the pandemic and was now more cut off as Western sanctions batter the Russian economy. She said that he was likely surprised and angered by how far the West has gone with sanctions, and was now worried of the backlash that would likely soon come from the Russian people. ""There is a sort of humiliation of a country that is now seeing McDonald's close, where Russians are flocking to IKEA to get every last item that's available before it leaves the country -- that is humiliating, and of course, also rather frightening when you think of the potential reaction among the Russian public once these consumer goods are no longer available,"" she said. Putin's ominous warning to Russians came as the UK's Defense Ministry said the invasion had ""largely stalled on all fronts."" ""Russian forces have made minimal progress on land, sea or air in recent days and they continue to suffer heavy losses,"" the ministry tweeted Thursday, adding that Ukrainian resistance remained ""staunch and well-coordinated."" That chimes with the assessment from a senior US defense official, who told reporters on Monday that Russian forces in and around several key cities had made no appreciable progress over the prior weekend. It may be wishful thinking to read so much into this pause. Russia's military is far mightier than Ukraine's by every measure. Any ""stall"" is more likely to be tactical than a sign of Russia backing down. Nonetheless, Russia's invasion hasn't brought easy pickings for Putin. In 2014, Russia was able to annex Crimea in around three weeks -- the same amount of time this war has raged so far. Ukraine's resistance, propped up by weapons sent from the West, has been greater than Putin had calculated, experts said. That's clear by the way Russian forces are now bombing civilian targets indiscriminately. They are also showing signs of being stretched to their limits. A public intelligence assessment report released Tuesday by the UK Defense Ministry said that Russia was calling up reinforcements from across the entire country. This includes the eastern section of the Russian Federation, troops in the Pacific Fleet and Armenia, as well as fighters from ""private military companies, Syrians, and other mercenaries."" Braw said that the stall in Russian forces' movement was likely the result of Russia working out next steps. ""Russia clearly counted on a swift and decisive success, which didn't happen. They face more united, better trained Ukrainian fighters than Russia appreciated,"" she said. ""So they went to Plan B, which was brutal warfare, but Ukraine is standing firm. They are winning back towns, they recently liberated a local mayor who was taken captive. So if that's not working, what's Plan C?"" At the very least, Ukraine's resistance has put the country in a better place for negotiations with Putin than it would have been at the start of the war, Braw said. What Putin won't want is to lose many more soldiers, she added. ""If Russia returns from the Ukrainian war with a completely decimated military, it's clearly pursued the wrong strategy.""",7,4.310895772499981,2.6164593365898976,1.6944364359100832,23
2022-03-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/politics/russia-military-ukraine-what-matters/index.html,Russia seems to have a very bad army. That's not good for Ukrainian civilians,"The accounts of Russia's military issues and ineptitude during its three-week-long invasion of Ukraine are too numerous to list. The proof of Russia's military problems is in a video of Russian tanks, stuck in a line, being destroyed by Ukrainians -- and in reports of Russian combat deaths, which already may be anywhere from 3,000 to more than 10,000. If those death tolls are toward the higher end -- and we really don't know -- it has been noted that would mean Russian deaths to date could be more than US military combat deaths during 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan combined, although the total death tolls from those conflicts were far greater than just US military deaths. There are numerous accounts of Russian soldiers surprised to learn they had been sent to war. CNN spoke with Russians held as prisoners of war in Ukraine. Nearly a dozen POWs have appeared in news conferences -- public appearances that may be questionable under the Geneva Conventions, which forbid countries from unnecessarily humiliating POWs. Soldiers with regret CNN decided to publish interviews with captured Russian pilots. CNN had the only journalists in the room and at no time did Ukrainian Security Services, which also was in the room throughout, interject or direct CNN or the prisoners to ask or answer specific questions. The interview was conducted in Russian. One, a pilot named Maxim, became emotional with anger and regret at what Russia has done. ""It's not just about demilitarizing Ukraine or the defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but now cities of peaceful civilians are being destroyed,"" Maxim said. ""Even, I don't know, what can justify, f**k, the tears of a child, or even worse, the deaths of innocent people, children."" There are reports of Russian soldiers who were surprised to learn they had invaded a country rather than taken part in a training exercise. Others have abandoned their posts. Why did Russia's army perform so poorly? Among the most detailed and engaging analyses cataloging Russia's foibles is an excellent conversation between retired Gen. David Petraeus, who formerly headed the CIA and commanded US forces in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the journalist Peter Bergen. Read it here via CNN Opinion. Petraeus praised the determination of the Ukrainians: ""They are fighting for their national survival, their homeland and their way of life, and they have the home-field advantage, knowing the terrain and communities."" But he also described the Russian army's shortcomings, which begin with the fact that some portion of it -- a quarter, according to one estimate -- is made up of conscripts rather than professional soldiers. The US, too, has a selective service for all American men in case a draft is ever needed. But while the American draft has been dormant since Vietnam, young Russian men may serve one-year rotations in the military. That's barely enough to get them out of basic training and into a unit, Petraeus said. The Russians have had problems with intelligence, communications and vehicles getting stuck in traffic jams, stuck in the mud and breaking down. ""So in every single area of evaluation, the Russians, starting with their intelligence assessments and understanding of the battlefield and their adversary, and then every aspect of the campaign, all the way down to small unit operations, have proved woefully inadequate,"" Petraeus argued. While they have up to 150,000 troops involved in Ukraine, that's not nearly enough to occupy Kyiv, much less the entire country, he said. An incapable Russian army is not entirely good news ""Failing militaries can be even more dangerous than successful ones,"" writes Kori Schake, director of foreign and defense policy at the American Enterprise Institute, in The Washington Post. It is exactly their incompetence that could make this war so devastating, she argues. ""There's reason to worry that the ineptitude and lack of professionalism that Russian forces have displayed in the first three weeks of the conflict are making fighting considerably more brutal for civilians than a more competent military would — and increasing the prospects that the war escalates."" The strategy is now to terrorize Retired Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt was asked Thursday on CNN about the seemingly indiscriminate use of imprecise weapons in civilian areas, something he said must be intentional. ""Their job is to terrorize the population. They're trying to make sure that the cities are shelled, that the people see this kind of shock and they want the city to capitulate. They want to surround it. They want to shell it. They want to starve it, and the Russians then will storm it. This is intentional, and whether these (are) dumb bombs or precision weapons, it doesn't matter."" Photos of a bombed theater housing children seeking refuge in the city of Mariupol, a bombed maternity ward and bombed apartment buildings have renewed calls for war crimes prosecutions. But they are also evidence of desperation on the part of the Russians. ""To me, as a layman, I am not haggling over war crimes because that's clearly what the Russians have resorted to,"" James Clapper, former director of national intelligence, said Thursday on CNN. ""And the reason for it, of course, is the fact they essentially failed in a conventional, tactical attack, so they're resorting to what they can do, which is wanton destruction and the killing of innocent civilians."" Fear can work both ways Clearly, from the accounts of captured soldiers, this war caught many Russians by surprise. Ukrainians can build that into their defense strategy. ""What Ukrainians need to do is instill fear in the heads of every soldier that around the corner is some civilian or some member of the military who is going to attack them,"" Evelyn Farkas, a Pentagon official during the Obama administration, said Thursday on CNN. Calling in reinforcements Petraeus said it was unclear to him how the Russians could rotate their soldiers out of combat roles given their stalled supply lines and their level of commitment. One indicator may be in a report from the Japanese Ministry of Defense, which told the US it saw Russian ships from the Asian side of the country traveling with combat vehicles, perhaps to reinforce the Ukraine front.",7,2.444790792100648,3.258184038355136,-0.813393246254488,6
2022-03-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/politics/russia-us-cyberattack-infrastructure-invs/index.html,"US has 'significant' cyber vulnerabilities, but a sweeping Russian cyberattack is unlikely","In the winter of 2015, computer hackers working for the Russian government attacked Ukraine's power grid and switched off the lights and heat to more than 200,000 consumers. Last year, a cybercriminal group with operatives in Russia launched a successful ransomware attack on a key East Coast pipeline that forced the company, Colonial Pipeline, to temporarily close the spigot and pay 75 bitcoins -- or $4.4 million -- to bring it back online. It was the largest cyberattack on an oil facility in US history. And it was a Russian government lab that built tools used in one of the most dangerous cyber offensives in the history of the digital age, penetrating the control systems of a Saudi petrochemical plant in 2017 for the purpose of setting off an explosion that, had it succeeded, could have killed people. So established is Russia's reputation for cyber sabotage that on February 24 -- as its troops began rolling into Ukraine -- President Joe Biden issued a warning to the country and its autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin. ""If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,"" he said during remarks from the White House. But now, even as the Russian army drops bombs and mortar shells on civilians in hospitals and neighborhoods and its invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week, no known nightmare cyber scenario --- a widespread power outage, a poisoned water system, a crippled supply chain -- has come to pass in Ukraine, the US or elsewhere. To be sure, a ripple of smaller cyberattacks ricocheted through the websites of Ukrainian banks and government agencies just before the invasion, and larger attacks may still be in store for the besieged country of 43 million people. But the general consensus among the nearly 20 experts who spoke with CNN for this story is that while Russia is well positioned to launch catastrophic cyberattacks on the US, it is not likely to do so. ""We do need to consider this possibility as a low probability but high-impact scenario,"" said Paul Prudhomme, the head of threat intelligence advisory at the cybersecurity firm IntSights. The prospects for a grand-scale cyberattack in America are low, experts say. For one, Putin understands that his country's cyber capabilities, though formidable, are outmatched by those of the United States, which is generally thought to be the most sophisticated player in the domain. The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told CNN it hasn't yet received any credible cyber threats resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, but it emphasized that the energy sector has been bolstering its defenses in recent years and is on high alert as it urgently prepares for any attempted breach. Experts say Russia's ability to conduct an impactful cyberattack in the US shouldn't be underestimated. ""If we look at just what they've been able to do, there is only, according to public knowledge, one country out there that has any experience taking down electric systems -- that's Russia,"" said Robert M. Lee, a cybersecurity expert who investigated the 2015 attack in Ukraine. Testing the waters Cyberattacks against the US by Russia are more than merely possible -- they've been happening for years on a low-grade scale. The country has been testing the waters in the US, laying the groundwork, experts say, for a much more extensive cyber campaign. For instance, in 2018, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that a group of state-sponsored hackers from Russia had compromised the networks of multiple US electric utilities the year prior and allowed intruders to gather detailed information on the control systems that US electric utilities use to power American communities. That same year, the Department of Justice announced the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers for carrying out large-scale cyber operations against the Democratic Party in advance of the 2016 presidential election. Then, in late 2020, came the most advanced cyber-op yet: About 100 organizations around the world -- including multiple US government agencies -- were revealed to have been breached by Russian hackers who compromised the software provider SolarWinds and exploited their access to monitor internal operations and withdraw data. Putin has been systematically testing vulnerabilities in Europe and the US for the past four years, and is in a position to cause all sorts of economy-crushing problems, experts say. ""They know how to weaponize these things -- they've done it,"" said Melissa Hathaway, who led cybersecurity initiatives in the presidential administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ""If I need to cause a national crisis in another country, they know how to do this, they've systematically been testing the system."" Prudhomme said a stealthy Russian hacking group called Energetic Bear -- which has been tied to Moscow's Federal Security Service, or FSB -- is the most likely Russian third-party, state-sponsored actor to execute any high-level attack. The group, which industry analysts refer to by several aliases, including ""Dragonfly"" and ""Berserk Bear,"" has carried out a number of successful hacks in recent years. In 2017, it targeted a nuclear power plant in Kansas in what cybersecurity experts refer to as a ""watering hole""-type attack -- a practice where hackers place malicious links on websites frequently visited by employees. ""The group has a history of gaining access and maintaining access to US and European utility companies, but they don't do anything with it,"" Prudhomme said. ""They want to have that access ready at a moment's notice so, if and when they get the order on demand, they can flip the switch."" In 2020, another state-sponsored Russian group identified by analysts as Cozy Bear, believed to be within Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, likely orchestrated the SolarWinds hack. US officials said the group used SolarWinds software to breach internal email systems at the US Treasury and Commerce departments, among other key agencies, in what was one of the largest-ever cyber attacks. But it's a two-way street. Experts say that while it's true Russians are lurking in the software of various structural areas, Americans are also lurking in theirs. It's the ""cyber equivalent of mutually assured destruction,"" said Karen Walsh, CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Allegro Solutions, using a term that historically described a philosophy of deterrence during the nuclear standoff of the Cold War. And the Americans, experts say, are currently the more capable threat. While Russian cyberattacks tend to attract headlines, experts told CNN, the most sophisticated hacks are often carried out in a more professionalized manner by countries such as the US and Israel, which are good at hiding their tracks. One secret operation that spilled into public view in 2010 was known as Stuxnet, in which the US and Israel are widely believed to have jointly sabotaged a nuclear facility in Iran with a computer virus that temporarily hampered the country's nuclear program. Putin, experts say, understands the extent of this sophistication and is likely loath to poke the bear. ""He seems to recognize that that's a different level of escalation,"" Timothy Frye, Columbia professor and author of ""Weak Strongman: The Limits of Power in Putin's Russia,"" said of a crippling cyberattack on a major electric utility in the US or another NATO country. ""That might be part of the calculations as well."" Still, some experts say, Europe's critical infrastructure could be an enticing target for Russia. That's in part because the continent is far more dependent on Russian oil than the US is. ""I don't think anyone's thought through how much control Russia has over the future of Europe,"" said Hathaway, now the president of Hathaway Global Strategies. Putin has been most willing to wreak havoc on the Ukrainian power grid, which the Russians also hacked in 2016 -- just a year after shutting off power to more than 200,000 consumers. Lee said the second attack -- which reportedly took out about a fifth of the power consumption in Kyiv for an hour -- was by far the more impressive of the two. ""That one scared the hell out of everybody,"" said Lee, now CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Dragos and a former cyber warfare specialist with the Air Force. ""That was a capability they developed that could be deployed on any electric transmission site in the world and have reliable effects everywhere. Like, it was -- it was bad."" The United States and the United Kingdom also have blamed the NotPetya hack of 2017 -- which the Trump administration called ""the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history"" -- on Russia. The NotPetya attack was launched against a Ukrainian accounting software firm, but the malware spread to companies across the globe, resulting in billions of dollars in damage. ""It was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in 2018. Some experts say the extensive meddling in Ukraine is due in part to how the country is seen as a kind of testing ground for belligerent cyberactivity. This is because the country's power grid is in some ways similar in structure to those in the US and other Western countries, but Ukraine's ability to retaliate has historically been minimal. Still, the US has seen a rise in high-profile cyberattacks. The growing threat prompted Biden to issue an executive order in May to shore up the nation's cybersecurity and protect federal government networks. And it is a reminder that cyber defense in the United States has troubling vulnerabilities. The US has 'significant' cyber vulnerabilities If the Colonial Pipeline breach demonstrated anything, it is the extent to which critical infrastructure in America is susceptible to cyberattacks. That event in May prompted the Georgia-based company to shut down the pipeline for the first time in its 57-year history. The six-day shutdown scrambled logistics for several airlines and caused a panic at the pump that led to shortages and briefly raised gas prices. But while it was allegedly carried out by a Russian hacker group called DarkSide, authorities haven't been able to link it to the Kremlin. (In fact, the Russian domestic intelligence agency arrested the alleged culprit -- though the hacker was not extradited.) The ordeal ended when Colonial ponied up the $4.4 million ransom — more than half of which was later recovered by the Justice Department. That attack, Prudhomme stressed, was financially motivated. The hackers, he said, used a compromised password found in a dark-web data dump and were able to employ an inactive VPN account to penetrate the Colonial Pipeline's network, which didn't use multifactor authenticati",20,4.860567412353989,6.141298259628755,-1.280730847274766,2
2022-03-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-16-intl/index.html,Attacks on civilians intensify as Ukraine and Russia say negotiations indicate progress,"Ukrainians face an increasingly desperate situation on the ground as Russian forces hit the capital and fresh targets across the country, despite both nations acknowledging signs of progress in ongoing negotiations. A theater where hundreds of people had taken shelter in the besieged southern city of Mariupol was bombed on Wednesday, according to local authorities, as hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in the coastal Ukrainian city that has been encircled for weeks by Russian forces. The word ""children"" was spelled out on two sides of the theater before it was struck, according to satellite images. Northern cities have come under increased attack, including the capital Kyiv, with two people injured in the shelling of a 12-story residential building early Wednesday. In the nearby Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, at least 10 people queueing for bread were killed when Russian forces shelled it on Wednesday, a local official, Vyacheslav Chaus, told Ukrainian television. He said the attack was indicative of Russia's use of indirect fire against civilians. Despite this, Russian forces are still ""generally stalled"" near Kyiv, and have not ""made any significant advances"" towards the city from the north, northwest or east of the city, a senior US defense official told reporters Wednesday. As the Russian assault intensifies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that Russia's negotiating position in talks between the two countries was becoming ""more realistic,"" a sentiment reiterated by Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who suggested there was ""a certain hope for reaching a compromise,"" in a televised interview to Russian media outlet RBK. But while the United States welcomes ""the sentiments expressed that there is hope, that there is optimism for diplomatic progress,"" it believes Russia must de-escalate for any such progress to actually be achieved, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Wednesday. Deteriorating situation in 'hell' of Mariupol Russian military strikes continue to bombard Mariupol, which has been besieged by Russian forces since the beginning of March. Petro Andruishchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, described the bombed theater as the largest shelter ""in number and size"" in the city's center. ""According to preliminary data, more than a thousand people were hiding there,"" he said. ""The probability of getting there to dismantle the rubble is low due to constant shelling and bombing of the city."" The bombing adds to the city's growing humanitarian crisis. About 350,000 people are trapped in the city and as many as 2,500 civilians have died, Ukrainian officials estimate. Those who remain are without electricity, water and heat. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies Monday showed the extent of the damage in Mariupol, including homes smoldering after apparently suffering Russian strikes, a destroyed apartment complex and rising plumes of thick smoke. After weeks of failed attempts to establish safe civilian evacuation corridors, about 20,000 people managed to leave the city on Tuesday, officials say. And on Wednesday, more than 3,000 cars transporting evacuees from Mariupol arrived in the central Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, the head of the regional administration, Oleksandr Starukh, said on his Telegram channel. However, Russian forces also attacked Zaporizhzhia for the first time on Wednesday, hitting a railway station and the area around the botanical garden, Starukh added. In another southern coastal city, the Ukrainian government said it staged a rescue of the mayor of Russian-occupied Melitopol, who was detained by armed men in the city on March 11. Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was freed as part of a prisoner swap, Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security said in a statement on Wednesday. According to the statement, Fedorov was exchanged for nine Russian soldiers, which the Ukrainians say are ""conscripts,"" born between 2002-2003. Russia has denied sending conscripts to Ukraine. Since Fedorov's detention, newly installed mayor Galina Danilchenko ordered the broadcasting of Russian television channels and attempted to dissolve the city council and instead create a People's Committee. Later Wednesday, a senior advisor to Zelensky said the Ukrainian army is beginning to counterstrike Russian forces in a number of directions. ""This fact is drastically changing the dispositions of the sides,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said in a statement posted to Telegram, adding that the ""Russian administration is trying to find allies whose soldiers would be ready to die on the field."" NATO 'not as essential' Amid signs of potential progress in Ukrainian-Russian talks, the Kremlin said Wednesday that President Vladimir Putin hadn't spoken to his US counterpart, Joe Biden, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, but contact between the two leaders can resume if necessary. Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian negotiating delegation, was quoted Wednesday as saying the talks were ""difficult"" and ""slow,"" and that Moscow's objectives in negotiations with Ukraine have not changed. Medinsky was quoted by state media RIA Novosti on Wednesday as saying Moscow wants a ""peaceful, free, independent and neutral"" Ukraine. He added that the country should not be a member of NATO or any military bloc. Putin sees NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act. This week, Zelensky appeared to shift away from his previous demand for NATO membership for Ukraine The Ukrainian President delivered an impassioned speech to members of Congress on Wednesday via videolink, receiving a bipartisan standing ovation both before and after his statement. Showing a graphic video of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, Zelensky repeated his calls for a no-fly zone in Ukraine and made references to Mount Rushmore, the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. ""In the darkest time for our country, for the whole Europe, I call on you to do more,"" Zelensky said. ""New packages of sanctions are needed, constantly, every week until the Russian military machine stops. Restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based."" Olha Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, told CNN the reason why Zelensky did not mention NATO is because it is ""not as essential"" as a no-fly zone and weapons -- and that political aspirations will have to go on hold for now. ""I think that NATO is something which is not as essential as a no-fly zone and more weapons and basically, capability to defend ourselves,"" she told CNN from a secure location in Kyiv. ""But now basically it's not about politics, it's about survival,"" she added. Stefanishyna said Putin is failing in the war because ""the chain of command which disinforms him, and the senior management around, shows that they know nothing about our nation."" ""I'm absolutely sure that he's uncomfortable in every moment that he's sitting in his bomb shelter,"" she said, adding, ""he fails in each of his assessments."" While US officials say the White House does not support instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine or supplying the Ukrainian Air Force with new fighter aircraft, Biden appeared to shift his stance on Putin. ""I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden said to reporters after remarks at the White House on Wednesday. He and other government officials had previously stopped short of saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used.",47,4.196613441071399,4.0932961869915525,0.1033172540798466,24
2022-03-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/politics/us-ukraine-aid-fact-check/index.html,Fact check: Trump's misleading claims on Obama-Biden aid to Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky virtually addressed members of Congress on Wednesday to press the United States for more assistance as his country attempts to counter Russia's invasion. Afterward, President Joe Biden detailed the latest aid package, which includes both defensive equipment and lethal weapons. The last time Russia invaded Ukraine, then-President Petro Poroshenko also addressed a joint session of Congress and famously said in 2014 that ""one cannot win the war with blankets,"" as part of an emotional plea for help arming his troops. In response, the Obama administration announced $46 million in security assistance to Ukraine, which included body armor and night vision goggles but no lethal aid. Over the weekend, former President Donald Trump criticized the Obama-Biden aid efforts to Ukraine by saying, ""They sent blankets. I sent Javelins."" Facts First: Trump's complicated history with aid to Ukraine aside, it's a misleading oversimplification for him to suggest his predecessor did not provide any military aid to Ukraine. While the Trump administration was the first willing to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, the Obama administration did provide defense and military equipment. By March 2015, the US had pledged $75 million worth of equipment including UAVs, counter-mortar radars, night vision devices, medical supplies and 230 armored Humvee vehicles, according to the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency. As Biden contemplates what additional assistance to provide Ukraine in its latest fight with Russia, here's a look at the aid the US has previously provided Ukraine. Since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, the US has committed more than $3 billion in security assistance to Ukraine. These aid packages have included military equipment to ""enhance Ukraine's defensive capabilities,"" according to a March 14 report from the Congressional Research Service. Through the Presidential Drawdown Authority and the Department of Defense's Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, the US has provided sniper rifles, grenade launchers, Javelins and small arms in addition to essential nonlethal equipment. The Biden administration in particular sent Stinger anti-aircraft weapons as part of the first PDA package of 2022 and has committed to redirect Mi-17 helicopters originally intended for Afghanistan through the Excess Defense Articles program. Over the past year, the US has given more than $1 billion in total security assistance to Ukraine, according to a February 26 statement from Secretary of State Antony Blinken. In 2021, Blinken authorized $260 million in military assistance to Ukraine and after the invasion began, he authorized an additional aid package of $350 million for ""immediate support"" for Ukraine. Biden administration officials have said they are continuing to send security assistance to Ukraine, even as the Russian invasion continues. Just last week, Congress approved a $13.6 billion emergency aid package for Ukraine and lawmakers have indicated bipartisan support for more aid. On Wednesday, Biden announced $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine, which comes from the emergency aid Congress approved last week. According to the White House, the $800 million will provide Ukraine with 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 100 drones, ""over 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds,"" 25,000 sets of body armor, 25,000 helmets, 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns, in addition to ""2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems.""",49,7.415879744898484,6.943174474594018,0.4727052703044654,8

Mariupol City Council, who shared an image of the destroyed building, said Russian forces had ""purposefully and cynically destroyed the Drama Theater in the heart of Mariupol."" ""The plane dropped a bomb on a building where hundreds of peaceful Mariupol residents were hiding,"" it said. CNN has geolocated the image and confirmed it is of the theater in the southeastern port city. The word ""children"" was spelled out on two sides of the theater before it was bombed, according to satellite images. Videos of the aftermath showed a fire raging in the theater's ruins. The number of casualties is unknown, authorities said. ""It is still impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act, because the city continues to shell residential areas,"" the council wrote on Telegram. ""It is known that after the bombing, the central part of the Drama Theater was destroyed, and the entrance to the bomb shelter in the building was destroyed,"" it added. Petro Andruishchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, described the theater as the largest shelter ""in number and size"" in the city's center. ""More than a thousand people were hiding there"" but ""the probability of getting there to dismantle the rubble is low due to constant shelling and bombing of the city,"" he said. Military strikes also hit a building that houses the Neptune Pool, just over four kilometers (approximately 2.5 miles) from the theater, according to videos shared by a local official. Its authenticity has been confirmed by CNN. Maxim Kach, a Mariupol city government official, said the building was for civilians, with only women and young children hiding within it and not military personnel. He said rescue workers were busy trying to get a pregnant woman out from under the rubble. CNN has not been able to verify that information. Mariupol has been besieged by Russian forces since March 1. After weeks of failed attempts to establish safe civilian evacuation corridors, about 20,000 people managed to leave the city on Tuesday, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said. Officials say its trapped residents have been surviving without electricity, water and food, with people melting snow or dismantling heating systems for a drop to drink. The relentless bombardment and street fights in the city have restricted movements. The day before, a Ukrainian official accused Russian troops of holding some 400 people captive at Mariupol's Regional Intensive Care Hospital. ""It is impossible to find words that could describe the level of cruelty and cynicism with which the Russian occupiers are destroying the civilian population of the Ukrainian city by the sea. Women, children, and the elderly remain in the enemy's sights. These are completely unarmed peaceful people,"" the city council said. ""We will never forgive and never forget,"" it added. The unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Mariupol has enraged local officials. ""These bastards are trying [to] physically destroy Mariupol and the people of Mariupol, which have been a symbol of our resistance,"" Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of Donetsk region administration, said on Facebook Wednesday. He says the ""fate is unknown"" of the hundreds of people sheltering in the theater ""as the entrance to the bomb shelter is blocked by rubble,"" he said. ""The Russians are already lying, [saying] that the headquarters of the Azov Regiment was there. But they themselves are well aware that there were only civilians,"" he said. After Russia bombed a maternity hospital on March 9, its Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov alleged without evidence that the hospital was the ultra-nationalist militia Azov battalion's base and that all patients and nurses had left. A Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson later denied in a briefing that Russia had shelled the maternity hospital at all, calling it a ""provocation."" Mariupol has been reduced to a battle zone, with the city's deputy mayor telling CNN on Tuesday that Russia has been bombarding the city with missiles, saying that they counted 22 aircraft on Monday ""which were bombing our city, and at least 100 bombs."" Residents who fled the city have described conditions there as ""unbearable"" and ""just hell."" On Tuesday, shocking drone footage and satellite photos showing rising plumes of thick smoke and destroyed buildings emerged, underscoring the sheer devastation wrought by the Russian bombardment. As many as 2,500 civilians have died in Mariupol, Ukrainian officials estimate, and hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in the city -- with officials warning those who remain are without electricity, water and heat.",47,4.88340750319797,8.450095317773016,-3.5666878145750465,24
2022-03-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/europe/germany-f-35-fighter-jets-replace-tornado-intl/index.html,Germany will buy US-made F-35 fighter jets as it ramps up military spending after Russia's Ukraine invasion,"Germany has announced that it will buy 35 US-made F-35A fighter jets, the first major arms purchase to be publicly confirmed since Chancellor Olaf Scholz committed to ramping up his country's defense spending in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The German government has made these decisions alongside a choice to become more active in European defenses. Scholz has also taken dramatic steps to limit Germany's economic ties to Russia, including halting the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. The F-35s will replace Germany's aging fleet of Tornados, the only planes in the Luftwaffe's inventory capable of carrying US nuclear bombs that are stored in the country in case of war breaking out in Europe. The decision to buy F-35s is significant as it will make Germany's air force more compatible with the rest of NATO and other European defense partners who either operate or intend to purchase F-35s. The US Defense Department said earlier this year that US Air Force F-35As in Europe would be certified to deploy the nuclear bombs before 2023. The F-35 comes in three versions, A, B and C, with just the F-35A being outfitted with nuclear capabilities. The fighter jets will be a significant upgrade for Germany. While the Tornado, which has been in active service since the 1980s and will be phased out by 2030, was capable of carrying US nuclear weapons, it has long been considered an out-of-date option in modern warfare. ""The Tornado was designed to penetrate air defenses by flying low, at transonic speeds. Going from that to the F-35 which combines stealth with unmatched situational awareness against aerial and ground-based threats, and its own electronic warfare capabilities ... it's just night and day,"" said Justin Bronk, airpower and technology research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. ""Any situation where you are dropping a NATO nuclear weapon would involve penetrating the most formidable air defense networks in the world. Flying low and fast as the Tornado would into that is simply not credible in 2022,"" he added. The purchase of these jets comes in the broader context of an enormous Germany shift in defense strategy over the past three weeks. Germany, a country that has resisted becoming a military power since the end of World War II, has pledged to dramatically increase its defense budget in line with the 2% NATO requirement. Scholz said that the increase in spending, which will leap from €47 billion in 2021 to €100 billion in 2022, was an acknowledgment that Germany ""will have to invest more in the security of our country to protect our freedom and democracy."" The increase in spending will make Germany the best-funded military in Western Europe and, post-Ukraine, it seems likely that Germany will be actively seeking to play a more prominent role in European security. The prospect of Germany suddenly playing this larger role may cause some degree of concern in other European capitals. France, previously the biggest military voice in the European Union, has been a cheerleader of closer European defense integration. It is unclear how a new, better equipped German military will fit into the EU's long-term defense thinking nor how it will act within NATO.",49,6.700037057597745,3.9307256026383746,2.7693114549593707,26
2022-03-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/europe/ukraine-detains-hacker/index.html,Ukraine detains 'hacker' accused of aiding Russian troops amid broader struggle to secure communications,"Ukrainian authorities have detained a ""hacker"" who was allegedly helping the Russian military send instructions via mobile phone networks to its troops, Ukraine's SBU security service said Tuesday. The suspect, whom the SBU did not identify, was accused of being on ""thousands"" of phone calls to Russian officials, including senior military officers and of sending text messages to Ukrainian officials suggesting that they surrender. The equipment seized was used to route Ukrainian mobile phone traffic to Russian networks, according to Victor Zhora, a senior cybersecurity official in the Ukrainian government. It's the latest development in the ongoing battle for communications networks in Ukraine as the Russian military continues to shell the capital of Kyiv. From Moscow to the front lines of the war in Ukraine, the ability to communicate to troops and citizens alike has been contested by suspected Russian and pro-Ukrainian hackers. Hackers last week caused outages at a Ukrainian internet service provider Triolan, which has customers in major cities. Triolan blamed ""the enemy,"" a reference to Russia, but did not provide evidence supporting that claim. Carmine Cicalese, former chief of cyberspace and information operations at US Army headquarters, said functional mobile phone networks are of particular importance to non-military personnel in Ukraine who are taking up arms against Russia and who do not have access to tactical communications equipment. More broadly, in war the ability to be able to communicate with friends and family is ""vital to maintaining morale,"" Cicalese, who is now president of cybersecurity firm Cyber Cic, LLC, told CNN. In a separate incident, satellite modems that provide internet service for tens of thousands of customers in Europe, including some in Ukraine, were taken offline in a cyberattack on February 24, around the time that Russian forces began attacking Ukraine, an official from the US telecommunications provider Viasat, which owns the affected network, told CNN. Zhora, the Ukrainian official who works at the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection, told reporters Tuesday that the satellite hack ""was a really huge loss in communications in the very beginning of the war."" The hack of the Viasat satellite network was a ""deliberate, isolated and external cyber event"" that a third-party cybersecurity firm and ""government partners"" are investigating, Viasat said in a statement. Chris Phillips, spokesperson for Viasat, told CNN in an email that the KA-SAT, the Viasat satellite network targeted in the hack, had been ""stabilized."" Phillips declined to specify how many customers had been affected by the incident, calling it a ""partial outage."" Reuters first reported on the scope of the Viasat hack and the US investigation. The US government is investigating the hack of Viasat as a potential Russian state-sponsored cyberattack, a US official familiar with the matter told CNN. The US National Security Agency is ""aware of reports of a potential cyber-attack that disconnected thousands of very small-aperture terminals that receive data to and from a satellite network,"" an NSA spokesperson told CNN. ""We continue to work with interagency partners and Allies to assess the scope and severity of the incident and make available any relevant expertise we possess.""",20,6.860288231181672,5.8758049369784455,0.9844832942032262,2
2022-03-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/biden-congress-soviet-made-weapons-ukraine/index.html,White House under pressure from Congress and Zelensky to find ways to deliver Soviet-made weapons to Ukraine,"Nearly three weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration is still assessing the most effective way to get military aid into the country without triggering a wider war. While administration officials say the effort to provide Ukrainian forces with American-made weapons such as Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles has been largely successful, the White House is under intense pressure to do more. Specifically, both Congress and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have pressured Biden officials to help broker the transfer of heavier Soviet-made weaponry to Ukraine, including MiG fighter jets and S-300 surface-to-air missile systems. It's a message that Zelensky could echo on Wednesday when he addresses Congress. But so far the Biden administration has not helped provide those heavier, Soviet-made weapons systems. US officials continue to grapple with concerns about how Russia might respond if certain weapons transfers are approved. Officials have also raised questions about how useful MiG fighters would be, and whether they are worth the risk. The State Department has been working to identify which countries currently have the Soviet-made S-300 air defense systems and is examining how they could be transferred to Ukraine, sources said. But it remains unclear how the US would backfill those countries' supplies of surface-to-air missiles, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions. A similar problem arose last week, when Poland indicated it would be willing to send MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, with the US telling Poland it would be unable to backfill the jets quickly. But a Republican Senate aide told CNN on Monday that Congress had solved that problem for the White House when it passed a long-delayed $1.5 trillion spending bill last week. That package included more than $13 billion in money to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including funding to directly backfill allies and partners who have delivered weapons to Ukraine from their own stocks. ""That's where we should urge the administration to work with allies and partners, not just in Europe but potentially around the globe, who are in a position to deliver more munitions for things like the S-300 or other advanced air defense systems that we can work with to backfill their own capabilities,"" the aide added. Top House and Senate Republicans sent a letter to the State and Defense departments on Tuesday calling on the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with Soviet-made air defense systems and fighter jets. The lawmakers said that the new funding Congress approved in an emergency supplemental should be used to deliver the military aid to the Ukrainians and help reimburse US allies who have also provided equipment and depleted their own stocks. Lack of visibility Almost all of the $350 million in weapons the Biden administration approved for Ukraine in late February have been delivered, according to multiple sources familiar with the status of the arms shipments. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden approved an additional $200 million military aid package for Ukraine, which includes more Javelin and Stinger missiles, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. US officials have told Congress that the weapons they are sending to Ukraine are getting where they are supposed to go, according to sources familiar with the matter. But two sources tell CNN that the NATO alliance has very little idea what percentage of the military assistance is actually getting into the hands of Ukrainian forces after it crosses NATO and European territory. NATO doesn't know because, deliberately, these shipments are being arranged by countries bilaterally -- directly with Ukraine -- and not through the alliance, the sources said. Nations have been told not to discuss with one another what they are sending and how. This is partly for security reasons, because Western officials don't want Russians to target the convoys, and informing the 30-country bloc of the transit points would increase the risk of such information leaking. But it also allows NATO to credibly say that as a bloc, it is not providing lethal assistance to Ukraine. Weekend strike Funneling weapons into Ukraine may also prove to be more complicated going forward as the Kremlin made clear over the weekend that Russian forces will now target US shipments flowing into the country. That warning, coupled with Russia's recent strike on a military base in western Ukraine, is raising concerns about Moscow's willingness to target aid shipments crossing the border from neighboring countries. NATO still does not believe, however, that Russia would target shipments still inside NATO or European Union member countries. Targeting arms shipments would be difficult for Russia, a source familiar with the intelligence added. It would need exact information on when and where the shipments are entering the country -- and have to cope with the added challenge that many are likely being transported under cover of darkness. Still, the strike appeared to be part of a messaging campaign by Russia, the source said, warning the West against continuing its military assistance to Ukraine. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the base was not being used as a transit point for shipments of weapons and US efforts to provide security assistance were not disrupted. But a second NATO source told CNN that the strike was concerning to the bloc, due to its proximity to Western countries that are sending materials into Ukraine. With the latest strike ""it certainly appears as if the Russians are broadening their target set,"" Kirby added, noting the weekend attack is just the latest sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not only sending a message about shipments of weapons into the country but also that he ""clearly has the occupation of Ukraine in mind."" As a result, the Biden administration now faces a delicate balancing act as it considers ways to expedite weapons shipments to Ukraine and address another concerted push by lawmakers to provide additional defense capabilities, including the S-300. Pressure from the Hill In the meantime, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are urging the Biden administration to step up its efforts to deliver more weapons to Ukraine. On Monday, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, told CNN he got an earful from Ukrainian American constituents this past weekend over the Biden administration's decision to oppose providing Polish MiG-29 jets to Ukraine. ""I went to a rally yesterday where that was the number one issue with the Ukrainian Americans, to give back the skies to the people of Ukraine and stop it,"" Durbin said. ""And I had to think in the context, as President Biden said in Philadelphia and said to us here in Washington, he doesn't want to risk world war III. It's a terrible, terrible decision that he faces, but I'm going to stand by him and work with him to do the right thing."" One lawmaker said the public attention in Congress pushing for the Polish MiG-29 jets has been misplaced, arguing that Ukraine already has planes it isn't flying, it doesn't have enough pilots to fly more planes and the country's runways have been damaged by Russian attacks. ""The controversy over the MiGs is a classic case of Congress focusing on the shiny object instead of what will actually matter,"" the lawmaker said. ""The things that will really matter are the S-300s, SAMs (surface-to-air missiles) and drones. DoD is looking at ways to get them from allies, since we don't have any we can give directly."" Senators have been publicly pushing for the Biden administration to change course on the Polish fighter jets since the opposition was announced last week. GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who was in Poland on Sunday on a congressional trip just miles from the Ukrainian border, pushed back on the notion that the MiG-29 fighters would cause an escalation with Russia during an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I don't know why that would be true,"" Portman said. ""You know, the Russians have complained about everything. Vladimir Putin has said that the sanctions are an act of war. They certainly complained when we provided Stingers directly from the US government, which can knock down an airplane and have been successful in doing that at lower altitudes."" But Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said the plan to provide Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets ""would not be effective."" ""They already have approximately 30 aircraft. They have problems with maintaining and flying those aircraft,"" Reed said. ""The real advantage would be to move in air defense missiles, which I hope they will do, because particularly some of the older ones, Soviet-era, they understand how to use them, since they've trained on them."" Operational security concerns The source familiar with the intelligence also told CNN that providing MiG fighter jets does not make a lot of operational sense. The aircraft present a big target and they are hard to move, which creates a myriad of logistical, operational and security problems. There are also operational security concerns around disclosing details about shipments of weapons to Ukraine, according to a senior defense official, who told reporters on Monday that the Pentagon is being very ""careful and cautious about talking about this."" ""We haven't put out specifics on the inventory. There are certain systems we still have not acknowledged ... that they're getting.

2022-03-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/europe/ukraine-mariupol-destruction-footage-intl/index.html,'Mariupol is now just hell': Survivors and drone footage reveal the scale of destruction,"Conditions in Mariupol are ""unbearable"" and ""just hell,"" residents who fled the besieged city in southeastern Ukraine have told CNN, as shocking drone footage and satellite photos emerged showing the utter devastation wrought by the Russian bombardment. Mariupol city council said on Tuesday that an estimated 2,000 private cars have been able to leave the city, and a further 2,000 vehicles are parked on the main route out of Mariupol as of 2 p.m. local time Tuesday. The departures took place despite the ongoing failure to formally establish safe corridors to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, which has been besieged since March 1. As many as 2,500 civilians have died in Mariupol, Ukrainian officials estimate. About 350,000 people are trapped in the city, with officials warning those who remain are without electricity, water and heat. Two women who managed to escape to the Zaporizhzhia region, about 140 miles away, on Monday told CNN about conditions in Mariupol and the frightening journey out. Lidiia, who did not give her surname due to safety concerns, told CNN that she decided to leave Mariupol after Russian bombardments started hitting closer to her home. ""We left the city under shelling -- there is no silence in Mariupol,"" the 34-year-old said. ""Today we talked to our neighbors, they said that the situation now is even worse, so no one knows whether people will be able to leave Mariupol today."" She said she had spent two weeks in a basement with about 60 other people, adding she only left occasionally to retrieve items from her apartment. Describing the journey out of the city, Lidiia said: ""We stopped several times and hid the children because the airplane was flying very low directly above us. We were afraid that we would come under fire. But it was no longer possible to stay in the city. Mariupol is now just hell."" Svitlana, who also did not give her surname over safety concerns, told CNN that she let 17 people shelter in her house after their homes were destroyed, and cooked soup in her garden using rainwater. ""When the war started, I didn't want to leave. But when shells began to fly overhead around the clock, it became unbearable to stay there,"" the 57-year-old said. ""My son stayed in Mariupol, I am very worried about him, but he decided to stay. I could not persuade him to leave."" Speaking about the conditions in Mariupol, Svitlana said: ""There are still many people left in the city. I told my neighbors that it is possible to leave, but they are afraid that everything is mined."" She added: ""Yesterday, the last grocery store in the city was bombed, I wonder how will people survive now?"" As the city is reduced into a battlezone, a Ukrainian official accused Russian troops on Tuesday of holding people captive at Mariupol's Regional Intensive Care Hospital, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Head of Donetsk regional administration, said doctors and patients were being held against their will, adding that one of the hospital employees managed to pass on information about what was happening. ""It is impossible to get out of the hospital. They shoot hard, we sit in the basement. Cars have not been able to drive to the hospital for two days. High-rise buildings around us are burning ... the Russians have rushed 400 people from neighboring buildings to our hospital. We can't leave,"" Kyrylenko said on his official Telegram channel, quoting the employee of the hospital. Kyrylenko said the hospital was ""practically destroyed"" several days ago, but that its staff and patients stayed in the basement where patients continue to be treated. Satellite images published by Maxar Technologies on Monday reveal the extent of the damage inflicted on the city, including the hospital and a number of apartment complexes. The hospital has a hole in its southern walls and debris can be seen scattered around, while the residential buildings show significant damage. Satellite photographs of the Primorskyi neighborhood, around a mile south of the hospital, show homes smoldering after apparently suffering Russian strikes. Drone footage which also emerged Monday shows a destroyed apartment complex and thick plumes of smoke rising over the west of the city. The video was posted on Telegram by the Azov Battalion, an ultra-nationalist militia that has since been integrated into the Ukrainian armed forces. CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the video. Multiple official attempts to establish safe corridors and evacuate civilians from Mariupol have failed in recent days. A large convoy of humanitarian aid that was meant to arrive on Sunday has still not reached the city as of Monday, according to officials. Some have resorted to melting snow and dismantling heating systems to get water to drink, said Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the city mayor, on Ukrainian television on Monday. ""Most of the people are staying in the basements and shelters in inhumane conditions. With no food, no water, no electricity, no heating,"" said Andriushchenko. Speaking on Monday, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in President Volodymyr Zelensky's Office, said that the bombardment of Mariupol has caused more than 2,500 deaths. CNN cannot independently verify these casualty figures. Also on Monday, Zelensky accused Russia of committing war crimes in its attacks on the city and other parts of the country. ""Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable. Responsibility for a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities is inevitable,"" he said. ""The whole world sees what is happening in Mariupol.""",47,7.820159837989844,1.3730908126477464,6.447069025342097,24
2022-03-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/europe/lviv-attack-aftermath-russia-invasion-intl/index.html,Russia's attack at Poland's border shattered the image of calm in western Ukraine,"On the surface, the western Ukrainian city of Lviv does not look like a city on the edge of a war zone. The streets are bustling with people. Austro-Hungarian architecture recently painted in pale hues stretches for miles. The trams still run on time and most of the shops that first shuttered after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his February 24 invasion of Ukraine have once again opened their doors. Yet beneath the city's relaxed exterior lies a crucial nexus in the war effort against Moscow's brutal assault against the former Soviet Republic. Lviv hosts one of the country's highest concentrations of internally displaced people -- over 200,000 in a city of just over 700,000 people. At the same time, the larger region serves as a crucial weapons supply route to the Ukrainian military and a wider resistance effort that has foiled Moscow's plans for a blitz-like invasion. At 50 miles from the Polish border, the city is also at NATO's doorstep -- any attack here could have international repercussions. ""Attacks in western Ukraine are dangerous because it could affect Poland,"" said historian Yaroslav Hrytsak, who was sitting at a trendy coffee shop in the historic center of Lviv. ""This could turn the conflict into an international conflict."" Tensions are ramping up here, despite the hundreds of miles that separate the region from Russia, culminating in a Russian strike on a military base close to the Polish border on Sunday. Russia says it is targeting arms supply shipments. The US denies that the attack disrupted weapon transfers. Western Ukraine's supply lane has become even more important as Russia chokes off sea passages and lays siege to the country's south. To the north is Belarus, which hosts Russian troops and has been one of the launching pads of the invasion. To the east is Russia. ""At one time it looked like Putin wasn't going to touch this region,"" said Hrytsak. ""He believed that western territory is too toxic, too anti-Russian. He wanted this region to go to the devil."" ""Now this has changed. Now Putin wants all (of) Ukraine,"" he added. When Russian forces bombarded the military complex in the Lviv region, families in the city heard the booms and thuds of Putin's war for the first time, getting a tiny taste of the horrors their countrymen and women further east have experienced for nearly three weeks. Analysts believe an invasion of western Ukraine remains a long way off, especially since the resistance in central, southern and eastern Ukraine has repelled a significant occupation of the country. Still, the attack seemed to bring the war closer to an international showdown. At least 35 people were killed and 134 injured in Putin's most westerly Ukrainian target -- just 15 miles from Poland, a NATO member. The site of the attack -- the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security at Yavoriv -- is the biggest military training facility in western Ukraine. It was also where NATO has performed drills. US instructors trained Ukrainian soldiers there last month, leaving before the invasion began. Russia claimed to have killed 180 ""foreign mercenaries"" without providing proof. Ukrainian officials said there were no reports of foreign casualties in the attack and NATO has denied that any of its units are in Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities have been relatively tight-lipped about the details around the attack, which only seemed to underscore its significance. When a CNN team tried to report from the site of the attack, the military had cordoned off the area around six miles away from the base. Public access roads leading to the site were blocked. The CNN team saw several people, who identified themselves as volunteer foreign medics, dressed in camouflage disembark from a van near a military cordon. ""The key point here is that Putin doesn't believe he is fighting Ukrainians. He doesn't see Ukraine as a separate entity or a viable state,"" said Hrystak. ""He believes he is fighting America and NATO on Ukrainian soil.""",4,3.1816735744980678,4.280211520546623,-1.0985379460485554,25
2022-03-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/europe/what-happened-ukraine-weekend-03-14-intl/index.html,Five important things that happened in Ukraine over the weekend,"Almost three weeks after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, its forces are expanding their offensive to the west of the country. Here are five important developments from this weekend. Russian missiles kill dozens at military training center near Polish border At least 35 people were killed and 134 injured in a Russian missile strike on the Yavoriv military training base in western Ukraine early Sunday local time, Ukrainian authorities said. The base is located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Lviv and less than 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) from the Polish border. It's home to the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, which hosts training exercises with Western military personnel. On Sunday, Russia said up to 180 foreign mercenaries were killed by the strikes, but Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesperson Markiyan Lubkivsky told CNN the claims were ""pure Russian propaganda."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said there had been ""some damage"" to the facility, but the Pentagon was ""still assessing and talking to the Ukrainians"" about the extent of it. No American service members were at the training facility because they had all left weeks earlier, Kirby told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday. The strikes show increased Russian focus on the west of the country, he added. ""This is the third... facility or airfield that the Russians have struck in western Ukraine in just the last couple of days, so clearly, at least from an airstrike perspective, they're broadening their target sets,"" Kirby said. Explosions in Kyiv as Russian forces inch closer At least two people died and three more were hospitalized after a residential building in Obolon, a suburb of the capital, Kyiv, was hit by shelling early on Monday morning, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. Several heavy explosions also reverberated across Kyiv at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) Monday. They appear to have been caused by Ukrainian air-defense batteries aiming at either Russian aircraft or cruise missiles. Trails of smoke heading into the sky could be seen from central Kyiv. On Saturday, the UK Ministry of Defence said the bulk of Russian ground forces were now only 15.5 miles (25 kilometers) from the center of the Ukrainian capital. Thousands dead in Mariupol as conditions grow even worse More than 2,500 people have been killed by the Russian bombardment of the southern city of Mariupol, according to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in President Volodymyr Zelensky's office, and the humanitarian situation continues to worsen. ""The Russians are just wiping the city out,"" Arestovych said on Monday. A shipment of humanitarian supplies has been unable to reach the city due to heavy shelling, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said on Sunday. ""The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,"" Vereshchuk said. ""The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city."" On Sunday morning, a Mariupol resident recorded a video diary revealing the desperate situation for civilians. The footage, posted on Twitter, shows looted shops and people trying to cook outdoors in sub-zero temperatures. ""There's no humanitarian aid and will not be. The evacuation of peaceful people is impossible,"" the resident said. ""People are in a devastating situation. Water, food are coming to an end, people are forced to break into shops, in search for necessities."" Mass protests in occupied Kherson and accusations of treason in Melitopol The strategic city of Kherson in southern Ukraine has been occupied by Russian forces since March 3, but on Sunday hundreds of people took to the streets to protest the occupation. In recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for a ""Kherson People's Republic."" City mayor Ihor Kolykhaiev said the demonstration was ""a peaceful protest to show that the citizens' position is that Kherson is Ukraine."" Russian forces have been accused of abducting local Ukrainian officials in two other cities. On Friday, the mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, was seen on video being led away from a government building in the city by armed men. A short time later, the Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed that Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses and was under investigation. Galina Danilchenko was installed as the new mayor of the city, but Ukraine's prosecutor general has opened an investigation after a group of Melitopol City Council members issued a written statement on Sunday accusing her of ""the high crime of treason, for attempting to set up an occupying government in Melitopol."" Separately, Yevhen Matveyev, the mayor of Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia region, was abducted by Russian troops on Sunday, according to Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba. US-China talks scheduled after Moscow reportedly asks Beijing for military support in Ukraine Russia has asked China for military support, including drones, as well as economic assistance for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, according to conversations CNN had with two US officials. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development. It could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country, and provide a counterweight to the hefty Western sanctions imposed on Russia's economy. When asked by CNN about the reporting of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement: ""I've never heard of that."" The Russian embassy in the US did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. US and Chinese officials will meet in Rome on Monday for talks that experts say could have far-reaching consequences not only for the war in Ukraine, but for China's role in the world and its relationship with the West. The meeting, between China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, comes as concerns grow in the West that Beijing is not only siding with Russia by not condemning its aggression in Ukraine, but could take further steps to aid its strategic partner.",47,1.4343877417576625,3.742365891637685,-2.3079781498800225,27
2022-03-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/politics/senators-homeland-security-cyberthreat-russia/index.html,Bipartisan group of senators push Mayorkas for details on US readiness for a Russian cyberthreat,"A bipartisan group of senators is sharing concern with the Biden administration about the potential of widespread Russian cyberattacks in the United States as retribution for harsh sanctions against Russia in the wake of President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Sunday evening obtained by CNN, 22 senators, led by Nevada Democrat Jacky Rosen and South Dakota Republican Mike Rounds, raised questions about America's readiness for Russian cyber and disinformation threats. ""Given Russia's history of disruptive cyber and disinformation activities, we are concerned that the United States may be targeted in retaliation for actions taken to impose costs on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine,"" the senators wrote. DHS did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The Biden administration has been on alert for potential Russian criminal or state-backed cyberattacks against critical infrastructure targets in the US -- a posture that Washington assumed months ago but that has grown more acute since Russia invaded Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month that the US is ""very much on guard"" for potential Russian cyberattacks in light of the war. While there have been several hacks of Ukrainian organizations, there have been no significant reports of the sort of high-impact cyberattacks on transportation or electric infrastructure that some have feared. In their letter, the group of senators requested a briefing from Mayorkas about what the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) -- which falls under DHS -- is doing to proactively defend against Russian state-sponsored threats and what sectors might be targeted. They also asked whether a strategy is in place if critical infrastructure is breached and how CISA is ""coordinating with international partners"" on the matter. For months, CISA, the White House and agencies including the Treasury Department have held briefings with key sectors like banking and energy on Russian cyber capabilities and the possibility for retaliation in cyberspace. According to CISA's website, there are currently no specific or credible cyber threats to the US. Russian government-linked hackers have a long track record of infiltrating US government agencies and probing US critical infrastructure. Last year, the Biden administration attributed a successful 2020 cyber-espionage campaign that exploited SolarWinds software to breach several government agencies to Russia's foreign intelligence service, SVR. Russian-speaking ransomware groups have also disrupted US critical infrastructure, most notably last year during the days-long shutdown of Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel transporter for the East Coast. In February, President Joe Biden designated DHS as the lead federal agency to coordinate domestic preparedness and response efforts related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Last month, CNN reported that a senior FBI cyber official warned American businesses and local governments to be vigilant about potential ransomware attacks.",20,6.285053583319486,8.305063504545906,-2.0200099212264204,2
2022-03-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-13-intl-hnk/index.html,Dozens killed as Russian forces strike targets in western Ukraine,"Russia expanded its offensive to western Ukraine on Sunday, firing missiles near the city of Lviv and hitting a large military base close to the Polish border, reportedly killing dozens of people and drawing the war closer to the borders of a NATO country. The attack came the day after the Kremlin threatened to attack Western weapons shipments to Ukraine. As the invasion runs into its third week, the northwest city of Lviv has largely been spared from Russia's relentless bombardment. The picturesque city has instead become ground zero for displaced Ukrainians. Hundreds of thousands of them have flooded into the city in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the Polish border about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away. But Russia's war is moving closer to the cultural hub. Russian forces fired more than 30 missiles at Yavoriv military training ground on Sunday, according to Lviv's military administration. Located between Lviv and the Polish border, the military base has held joint drills with NATO and Western military personnel, including the United States. A witness, who was on the base when the strike happened, told CNN of hearing a ""sudden clap"" from a bomb shelter, adding that the explosion craters were 10 meters deep and there are fears people are under the rubble. Local authorities say 35 people were killed and 134 injured at the military base, in what Ukraine's Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov described as a ""terrorist attack"" on peace and security ""near the EU-NATO border."" There were no reports of foreign nationals among the casualties so far, say Ukraine defense officials. The strike came the day after Russia launched a missile attack in the northeastern city of Lutsk, only 70 miles from the Polish border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that it was only a matter of time before Russia's military assault on Ukraine expanded to members of NATO -- unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone in Ukraine. ""Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,"" Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page. ""Now, I repeat again, if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries."" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that the strikes on Lviv were a sign that the war was not going to plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,"" Sullivan said. A senior US official told CNN Sunday that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development in Russia's invasion, and could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country. When asked by CNN about reports of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, ""I've never heard of that."" As attacks on civilian areas continued throughout the weekend, a new round of Russian-Ukrainian talks has been set for Monday. Zelensky alluded to the talks in his remarks Sunday, saying his country's delegation ""has a clear task -- to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for."" US President Joe Biden spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday evening, according to a White House official. Macron had spoken to Putin on Saturday in a joint call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. American journalist killed in Ukraine Heavy fighting continued Sunday, with Britain's Ministry of Defense saying Russia was attempting to ""envelop"" Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as it advanced from Crimea westwards towards Odessa. Russian troops continue to focus on the capital Kyiv. Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin leader of Russia's Chechnya region, reportedly told Russian soldiers outside of Kyiv that the key task is to seize the capital, Russian state news network Russia 24 reported on Sunday. Amid a growing civilian toll in Ukraine, American journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to social media posts by Kyiv region police. Two other journalists were wounded by Russian troops, the police added. Renaud ""paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty, and ruthlessness of the aggressor,"" an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement on Telegram. The US State Department confirmed Renaud's death on Sunday. ""We are horrified that journalists and filmmakers—noncombatants—have been killed and injured in Ukraine by Kremlin forces,"" department spokesman Ned Price said on Twitter. ""This is yet another gruesome example of the Kremlin's indiscriminate actions."" Social media footage has emerged of a journalist identified as Juan Arredondo, a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, at Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv, in which he describes being shot at by Russian forces while driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city. The exact circumstances of the attack against the two journalists are yet to be determined. TIME released a statement Sunday saying Renaud was in the region working on a TIME Studios project on the global refugee crisis. ""We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud. As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,"" TIME Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and President and COO Ian Orefice in the statement. Ukrainians take to the streets to protest Ukrainians continue to protest Russian occupation. The southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces, saw the biggest protest since the invasion on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the streets to protest against suspected Russian plans to turn the southern Ukrainian oblast into a breakaway republic. Waving Ukrainian flags, the protesters chanted anti-Russian slogans, filled with expletives about Putin, according to videographer Artem Ivanov, who is on the ground in Kherson. Ihor Kolykhaiev, the mayor of Kherson, said in a video posted on Facebook Sunday that mass protests show ""Kherson is Ukraine"" and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city. But the mayor also said that the city had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources. He said that the city ""can't receive a humanitarian cargo here, food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of the medications and insulin."" ""Our main weapon is unity,"" he added. In recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the ""Kherson People's Republic."" If true, the move would mirror Moscow's establishment of two Russian-backed breakaway states in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Putin recognized the independence of those two territories in the days leading up to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine as part of his pretext to launch an assault on the country. School demolished by Russian strike Russia's air offensive on Sunday also bore down on heavily populated areas around the country. Nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment in Mykolaiv Sunday, local officials said. The strategic southern city has resisted Russian occupation and impeded an apparent push towards the major port of Odessa to the west. A school in the village of Zelenogai, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Mykolaiv, was demolished by a Russian military strike, Mykolaiv regional administrator Vitali Kim said. Kim said that the military strike left several people either dead or in critical condition. ""Some people got under the rubble and we are evacuating them,"" Kim said. Missiles also destroyed an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, while the northern city of Chernihiv was struck for the third night in a row, hitting a high-rise building, the regional head, Vyacheslav Chaus, said. In the eastern region of Luhansk, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces, the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been ""massive shelling"" of several towns, including Kreminna and Rubizhne, which had prevented buses from leaving with civilians. The Ukrainian military thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows. The bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on March 10, appearing to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles. Ukrainian forces in Kyiv's suburb of Irpin have so far repelled the Russian forces' attempted advance towards the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by the Ukrainians, the river poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military. Also on Sunday, Ukraine's National Energy Company Ukrenergo completed repair work and resumed power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the company announced. The plant's electrical system was damaged during a Russian attack on March 9. Later on Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that the staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment. As the devastation mounts, Zelensky said the key task Sunday is to get the humanitarian convoy that is traveling towards the besieged city of Mariupol to its destination. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a week. Much of the city is without power and water. Mariupol's city administration confirmed Sunday night that the convoy was still stuck some 50 miles to the west. As the city waits, officials said it had suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours and ""to date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia."" Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that nine of the 14 evacuation routes declared Sunday had allowed civilians to escape fighting. About 3,950 people were rescued in the Kyiv region and 1,600 were able to escape from the Luhansk region in the east of the country, a",47,4.345073299608756,4.183295218663885,0.16177808094487034,25
2022-03-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/politics/fact-check-russia-misinformation-ukraine/index.html,Fact Check: 5 times official Russian statements conflicted with intelligence and on the ground actions,"As its troops fight on the ground in Ukraine, Russia is waging a parallel war of misinformation. Even before Russian forces crossed the border, Russian officials were crafting a narrative at odds with reality. Publicly claiming one thing while intelligence suggests another isn't unusual, but Russia has gone so far as to insist its actions don't constitute war or that it has no plans to impose forces even while Russian troops set off explosions in key Ukrainian cities and attempt to gain control of strategic sites. Most recently following an attack on a hospital in Mariupol, a key city in the south of Ukraine, Russian officials have repeatedly changed their narrative. First, they stated Russia would never attack civilian targets, then claimed it was a false flag operation conducted by Ukrainian rebels, but they never took responsibility. Here are five examples of Russian officials essentially trying to gaslight Western officials and the broader public regarding Ukraine. Mariupol hospital Russian statements After the March 9 attack which wrecked Mariupol's maternity and children's hospital, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested civilians had not been present at the time. ""All the women in labor, all the nurses, in general, all the staff was driven out of there,"" Lavrov said on March 10. Reality Visibly pregnant women are present in videos and photos from the hospital after the attack. Mariupol's city council said children, women and doctors were among the 17 injured in the attack. Ukrainian officials say Russian forces were behind the attack, though Russian officials have insisted that's not the case. No attack Russian statements On March 10, Lavrov flat out denied Russia had attacked Ukraine, saying, ""Russia has no plans to attack other countries. We have not even attacked Ukraine."" Reality Lavrov's remarks came more than a week after Russia's initial invasion into Ukraine and as Russian forces attempted to seize control of several key Ukrainian cities. For example, authorities described the situation in Mariupol, which had been under siege from Russian forces, as ""critical"" due to heavy shelling. And a week before Lavrov insisted Russia had not attacked Ukraine, a Russian strike hit an apartment building in a city north of Kyiv, leaving at least 33 people dead. A limited operation Russian statements When Putin dispatched Russian troops into the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine on February 22, he initially described it as a ""peacekeeping"" mission. And in a TV broadcast early on the morning of February 24 after troops had invaded Ukraine, Putin referred to it as a ""special military operation,"" insisting it was limited to the Donbas region and stating that Russia does ""not plan to impose ourselves on anyone."" Reality Russia's presence in Ukraine is not limited. Their forces span most of the country, surrounding or attempting to surround key cities well beyond the Donbas. During and shortly after Putin's speech, reporters on the ground noted explosions could be heard in the capitol city of Kyiv as well as Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, and Odessa, a key port city -- none of which are in the Donbas region. That same day, Russian forces took control of Hostomel airport just outside of Ukraine's capital. In response to US aggression Russian statements Pushing back on reports of aggressive Russian troop positioning around Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov suggested in an interview on December 11 that any movements of Russian forces were in response to US military presence and movements in the region. ""Russia is moving its forces within its territory, and we can move our forces in any direction we want and closer to the areas that could pose a threat [and currently] we see US warplanes landing in Ukraine and US military equipment approaching our borders,"" Peskov said. Reality Less than a week later, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to discuss Russia's military build-up in and around Ukraine, Russia announced it wanted a legally binding guarantee that NATO would give up any military activity in eastern Europe and Ukraine and end a nuclear sharing agreement which allows the US to keep its nuclear weapons in Europe and use aircraft from European members of NATO to deliver nuclear weapons if needed. These proposals were in response to what Russia sees as threats to their own security from Ukraine's relations with NATO and NATO member nations. However, the US has been providing aid to Ukraine since 2014, and US warplanes landing in Ukraine with military equipment is not unusual. Some small arms and ammunition from the US were delivered to Ukraine days before Peskov's remarks as part of a previously scheduled security assistance package approved in September. The US military also helps train Ukrainian troops, though CNN reported that the Pentagon would not go into detail about timelines for operations or deployments, nor would it say if any schedules changed in light of the buildup of Russian forces near Ukraine. The Pentagon did note that US Marines operate throughout the continent for training and exercises. No plans to attack Russian statements On November 28, 2021, Peskov told state news agency TASS that ""Russia has never hatched, is not hatching and will never hatch any plans to attack anyone."" Reality Days later, a US intelligence report warned that Russia was planning to attack Ukraine in early 2022, The Washington Post first reported. US intelligence regarding Russian troop movements and Putin's decision to invade largely proved true. For months, Russia amassed forces along the border, underlying the premeditated aspect of the ultimate invasion in February. And in the weeks leading up to the invasion, the US widely shared that its intelligence suggested Putin would invade shortly.",4,4.531055900880546,2.700015844170589,1.8310400567099574,27
2022-03-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/europe/russia-ukraine-war-cyber-attacks/index.html,Russia's cyber offensive against Ukraine has been limited so far. Experts are divided on why,"US officials warned that a wave of debilitating cyberattacks could accompany Russia's war on Ukraine. So far they haven't materialized, and US and Ukrainian officials are contemplating why as they prepare for the next phase of the war. There have been several hacks of Ukrainian organizations, but no reports yet of the sort of high-impact cyberattacks on transportation or electric infrastructure that some feared. The possible explanations for this, analysts say, range from disorganization in Russian military planning to hardened Ukrainian defenses, to the fact that bombs and bullets take precedence over hacking in wartime. The reason Russia has so far not flexed in cyberspace during the war may be unattainable — or require being inside the minds of Russian spy chiefs. But how US, European and Ukrainian officials perceive the situation shapes how they allocate resources to defend Ukrainian computer networks as the war continues. ""What we have seen to date from Russia's state cyber actors appears to reflect the same challenges seen in their conventional forces,"" said a US cyber defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. ""It is likely that inadequate preparation and bad assumptions have resulted in a haphazard performance that underplays their known capabilities."" Limited Russian cyberattacks Cyberattacks have played a supporting, not a central, role in the war and hacking incidents preceded and accompanied Russia's bombardment of Ukraine: • February 15: Cyberattacks temporarily knocked the websites of Ukrainian agencies and big banks offline. The White House blamed Russia for the incident (the Kremlin denied involvement). • February 23: Hours before Russian airstrikes began hitting Ukraine, a cyberattack deleted data at multiple Ukrainian government agencies and private companies. • February 25: Ukrainian government officials accused hackers working for the Belarusian Ministry of Defense of trying to break into the private email accounts of Ukrainian military personnel. • March 10: Unidentified hackers caused disruptions at Ukrainian internet service provider Triolan, which has customers in big Ukrainian cities. Triolan blamed ""the enemy"" (a reference to Russia) for the incident but did not provide evidence to support the allegation. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the most senior military cyber official in the US government, offered a vague, multi-faceted explanation for the relatively muted Russian cyber activity to lawmakers this week. Defensive work by Ukrainians, ""some of the challenges that the Russians have encountered, and some of the work that others have been able to prevent their actions"" explained the situation, said Nakasone, who heads the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command. ""They bomb critical infrastructure, So they don't need to hack it' Ukrainian computer defenses have indeed improved since 2015 and 2016, when cyberattacks cut power in parts of Ukraine, and 2017, when devastating malicious software known as NotPetya emerged in the country and spread to organizations around the world, costing billions of dollars in damage. (The Justice Department blamed Russia's GRU military intelligence directorate for all three attacks; the Kremlin denied involvement.) But many analysts say that heightened Ukrainian cyber defenses cannot be the sole reason for the lack of visible Russian cyber operations. And US officials are predisposed to crediting Ukrainian network defenses in which Washington has invested millions of dollars, and countless hours on the ground in recent years, in building them up. Yegor Aushev, a Ukrainian cybersecurity executive who helped organize an ad hoc group of hackers to target Russian organizations during the war, offered a simpler explanation. ""The first phase of the war was a hybrid war,"" Aushev said by phone from Ukraine this week. The Russians, he said, used cyberattacks because there is plausible deniability in doing so. But the second phase of the war has been out in the open. ""They bomb critical infrastructure,"" Aushev said. ""So they don't need to hack it, in hidden mode."" John Hultquist, vice president of intelligence analysis at cybersecurity firm Mandiant, echoed that point. ""Cyberattacks are often reversible and they are often carried out for their psychological effects,"" Hultquist, a US Army veteran, told CNN. ""And in a situation when the Russians are already shelling cities, those effects are going to be fairly limited."" The so-called Ukraine ""IT army"" that Aushev is working with claims thousands of volunteer hackers from Ukraine and abroad. The Ukrainian government is actively encouraging these cyberattacks on Russian organizations — and claiming that these hacks are disrupting Russian cyber activities aimed at Ukraine. ""As it turns out, [Russian computer] systems are not that secure,"" boasted Serhiy Demedyuk, deputy secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. ""They employed their potential to carry out destructive attacks on other states, but failed to secure their own resources."" The extent to which pro-Ukraine hacking against Russian organizations has been successful is difficult to assess. There have been disruptions to Russian state media websites that parrot the Kremlin's propaganda about the war. The longer game Another possibility is that the fog of war has obscured some Russian cyber activity. We might not hear about it for months if some of the elite hacking teams associated with Russian intelligence services have engaged in significant activity in Ukraine, Hultquist said. ""It's a perfect environment for chaos to hide in,"" Hultquist told CNN. All the more so if bombs destroy digital evidence of a hack. The Ukrainian government has made plans to move some of its computer infrastructure out of Kyiv as Russian troops continue to pound the city. Preserving those digital records could be key to learning more about any additional Russian cyber activity during the war. With the war grinding on, US and European officials are also wary of any spillover from a Russian hack in Ukraine that could hobble agencies or corporations in NATO countries. The data-wiping hack on the eve of Russia's invasion was precisely targeted, but did infect two Ukrainian government contractors with a presence in Latvia and Lithuania, which are NATO members. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said a cyberattack could trigger NATO's collective defense clause, requiring all members to defend an attack on another member. But that has never happened and it is unclear what NATO's threshold in cyberspace is. Erica Lonergan, associate research scholar at Columbia University's Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, said it would make sense for Russia to retaliate against Western government sanctions in cyberspace in a way that doesn't escalate conventional conflict with NATO. ""Precisely for the reasons that cyber isn't necessarily useful in the battlefield, it is a way that states engage in subversion, create information advantage and cause disruption,"" Lonergan told CNN.",20,6.098459292727126,6.484970152525158,-0.38651085979803224,2
2022-03-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-12-intl/index.html,Russia intensifies strikes around Kyiv as it warns US against arming Ukraine,"The Russian assault across Ukraine raged Saturday as explosions were heard in Kyiv and fighting intensified around the capital. Hours later, Russia warned the United States that it would fire on weapon shipments to Ukraine, raising the risk of direct confrontation between Moscow and a NATO country. A number of major cities are under pressure as Russian strikes hit civilian structures. Smoke rose east of the river in Dnipro early on Saturday where CNN journalists felt at least two explosions and saw the cloudy remnants of what looked like anti-aircraft fire. A large swath of Makariv, a village 30 miles west of Kyiv, has sustained significant damage from apparent Russian airstrikes. CNN geolocated and verified the authenticity of photos, posted to social media Saturday, which show major damage to apartment complexes, schools and a medical facility. One of the more stark images from Makariv shows a large hole in the northern wall of an apartment building from a military strike. Many of the buildings in the photos have sustained damage on their northern facades, evidence that points to military strikes that hit them as being Russian. In Chernihiv, some 100 kilometers north of Kyiv, local landmark Hotel Ukraine was hit overnight. ""I am here now. There is no hotel anymore,"" Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv region administration, said Saturday. The northern city, which is close to the Belarus border, has been surrounded by Russian forces for more than a week and video from the city showed the collapsed floors of the hotel as well as widespread damage from missiles and airstrikes. Chaus said civilians were dying from the strikes, which brought down the city's electricity network. ""Many people are being injured. The enemy shells civilian infrastructure, where there is no military,"" he said, saying the city has ""no electricity, almost no water, gas, and heat."" The Russian Ministry of Defense has repeatedly claimed that Russian forces are not targeting civilians. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Saturday address the whole country was now a front line. ""A few small towns just don't exist anymore. And this is a tragedy. They are just gone. And people are also gone."" Zelensky said negotiations to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""must begin with a ceasefire,"" adding that Ukraine has lost about 1,300 troops as of Saturday. CNN has been unable to independently verify these numbers. Later Saturday, Zelensky said that he was grateful for international support but urged allies to provide more aid. ""I keep reiterating to our allies and friends abroad; they have to keep doing more for our country, for Ukrainians and Ukraine. Because it is not only for Ukraine, but it is for all of Europe,"" he said. ""The evil which purposefully targets peaceful cities and ambulance vans and explodes hospitals will not stop with just one country if they have the strength to keep going."" The US and NATO say they're taking steps to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian troops, and they have continued to provide Ukraine with security assistance, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. But the US and NATO have also tried to avoid being drawn into an outright conflict with Russia. US President Joe Biden emphasized that point on Friday, that the US will not send ground troops into Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO. ""We will not fight the third world war in Ukraine,"" Biden said after reiterating the US' full support to its NATO allies and promising that the US will defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory. ""I want to be clear though, we are going to make sure that Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves from an invading Russian force. And we will send money and food aid to save Ukrainians' lives,"" he added. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Saturday warned the US against transferring weapons to Ukraine, saying convoys with foreign weapons would be considered ""legitimate targets."" ""We warned the United States that pumping Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries orchestrated by them is not just a dangerous move, but these are actions that turn the corresponding convoys into legitimate targets,"" Ryabkov said Saturday on the Russian state-run Channel One, according to state-owned RIA Novosti news agency. Determined resistance In Ukraine, Russia has faced defiance from the public in the past two weeks. On Saturday, several hundred people swarmed the city hall in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol following the detention of its mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by armed men the day before. Shortly after Fedorov's detention, the Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses, allegations that Zelensky called a ""crime against democracy"" on Saturday. The Zaporozhye regional administration said Saturday a new mayor had been installed. Galina Danilchenko, a former member of the Melitopol city council, was introduced as the acting mayor on local TV, according to a statement from the regional administration posted on Telegram. In her televised statement, Danilchenko said that her ""main task is to take all necessary steps to get the city back to normal."" She claimed there were people still in Melitopol who would try to destabilize ""the situation and provoke a reaction of bad behavior."" ""I ask you to keep your wits about you and not to give in to these provocations,"" she said. ""I appeal to the deputies, elected by the people, on all levels. Since you were elected by the people, it is your duty to care about the well-being of your citizens."" In Kyiv, Russia's advance has faced stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces. On Saturday, the UK's Ministry of Defence's latest intelligence assessment said the bulk of Russian ground forces were about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the center of the Ukrainian capital. Maxar satellite imagery taken on Thursday showed that the 40-mile Russian column northwest of Kyiv had largely dispersed and regrouped. But the intelligence assessment warned, ""this is likely to support a Russian attempt to encircle the city. It could also be an attempt by Russia to reduce its vulnerability to Ukrainian counter attacks, which have taken a significant toll on Russian forces."" The north and northeastern cities of Chernihiv and Sumy, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and Mariupol in the south, remain encircled by Russian forces, the ministry added. A senior Ukrainian official in the southern region of Kherson, now in Russian control, has said that the ""occupiers"" are pressing the regional council to agree to a referendum on the area's ""independence"" from Ukraine. There's been no word from the Russian side about any referendum plans. Similar referendums were held after Russian-backed separatists took control in 2014 of parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. People's Republics were later declared in both regions. Ukraine's state-operated nuclear energy company said Saturday that Russian officials had arrived at Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhya, demanding to take control of the facility. Zaporizhzhya has been occupied by Russian forces for more than a week now, with Energoatom previously claiming its employees had been forced to work at ""gunpoint."" Chernobyl nuclear power plant is also under the control of Russian forces. Despite the onslaught, Zelensky claimed on Saturday that Ukrainian forces are inflicting the ""biggest blow to Russia's army in decades,"" saying that 31 Russian tactical battalion groups had lost capability, and more than 360 Russian tanks have been lost. Zelensky added that groups of Russian troops were surrendering to Ukrainian forces, but that Russia is now recruiting fighters, reservists, conscripts, and mercenaries to ""outnumber"" Ukrainian forces. Russia's losses include Major General Andriy Kolesnikov, the third Russian general to have been killed by Ukrainian forces, a Western defense official confirmed on Friday. He was commander of the Eastern Military District, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense's website, and the Western official noted for context that three Russian general staff officers were killed during the whole Syrian conflict. Deteriorating conditions As Russia sustains losses, its bombardment of the country continues to degrade living conditions in several areas. Officials are now racing to send aid and evacuate citizens from encircled cities. Ukrainian officials announced a fresh attempt to secure at least 13 evacuation corridors from different cities, despite reporting that only a few civilians could leave the previous day. Addressing the besieged city of Mariupol, Zelensky said Saturday that Ukrainian forces would guarantee a ceasefire along an evacuation corridor so supplies could enter, and civilians can leave. With relatively clear skies over Mariupol, new satellite imagery taken Saturday morning from Maxar showed the extent of the damage there, including some caused by military strikes reported earlier in the week. In Mariupol's western neighborhood of Zhovteneyvi, a large -- still smoldering -- crater was seen near the Okko gas station. Smoke appeared to be rising from an apartment complex across the street. The roofs of warehouses down the street also appeared to have large holes from military strikes. Within the apartment complex, several buildings seemed to have sustained significant damage. A debris field was seen surrounding some of the buildings with a large smoke plume. Just northwest of the gas station, an additional satellite image showed impact craters dotting a snow-covered field. Vehicle tread marks were also seen. Just more than a mile south, in an industrial area in the Primorskyi neighborhood, a large fire was seen raging. There was some good news amid the destruction. A pregnant woman, whose rescue from the Mariupol maternity hospital this week was captured in a viral AP photo, gave birth to a baby girl, her family told CNN. Mariana Vishegirskaya was among a number of women at the Mariupol maternity hospital who survived the shelling. Her aunt Tatiana Liubchenko said the baby was named Veronica but she was worried about the situation in the city. ""We got the information that the water and food of the people there are running out and we are very worried, because the green corridor is not opened and the Russians do not allow, the food does not come. And it's so cold there right now so they can't get warm,"" Liubchenko said. The fighting has displaced around 2 million Ukrainians in the country, the UN said Friday, and 2.5 million people have fled its borders.",47,3.6901486837897743,1.563379133368525,2.1267695504212494,25
2022-03-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/europe/kyiv-russian-convoy-intl/index.html,The 40-mile-long Russian convoy near Kyiv has moved. Here's what it means for the Ukrainian capital,"A 40-mile-long (64km) Russian military convoy, composed of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery, has sparked dread among defending Ukrainians as it lumbered towards their capital, Kyiv. The column has been stalled for a week, but now the forces appear to be regrouping, according to Maxar Technologies satellite imagery taken on Thursday, which showed parts of the convoy had ""largely dispersed and redeployed."" Russia is regrouping for a possible attack on Kyiv, say UK defense officials, after initially making limited progress in its advancement towards the capital. An intelligence update published by the UK's Ministry of Defence on Friday said Russia ""is likely seeking to reset and re-posture its forces for renewed offensive activity in the coming days"" and it would likely ""include operations against the capital Kyiv."" With the clouds temporarily clearing around the Ukrainian capital, Maxar said the satellite images show some elements of the convoy have ""repositioned"" into forests and treelined areas near Lubyanka, Ukraine. The images were taken at 11:37 a.m. local time (4.37 a.m. ET) on Thursday. According to the satellite imagery, Russian military vehicles are seen sitting on roadways in residential areas in the town of Ozera -- 17 miles northwest of Kyiv and just north of the Russian-controlled Antonov Airbase in Hostomel. Towed artillery and other vehicles are seen taking cover in sparse patches of trees near Lubyanka -- about 3 miles (northwest of the Antonov Airbase. In Berestyanka -- 10 miles west of the airbase -- a number of fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field near trees. The satellite images taken on Thursday appear to also show fuel storage tanks on fire at the airbase, with a thick black plume of smoke seen rising from the tanks, located at the southern end of the airbase. Hostomel's airbase has been the site of intense clashes with Ukrainian forces since the start of Russia's invasion. It was reportedly captured by the Russian military on February 24. At the end of what was the convoy, a number of trucks and equipment are still seen on the roadway southeast of Ivankiv. Satellite images from Maxar also show significant damage to parts of the northern city of Chernihiv and the northwest suburbs of Kyiv. In Borodyanka, a series of apartment buildings is seen demolished. CNN has previously reported that these apartment buildings were damaged by Russian military strikes. Just outside of Kyiv's city limits in Stoyanka, a warehouse is seen in a satellite image completely gutted by fire. In the city of Chernihiv, roughly 80 miles northeast of Kyiv, the Epicenter K supermarket is also destroyed by fire. The charred remains of the building is seen; there is no more roof. A fire is also seen burning in one of Chernihiv's industrial districts, located on its south side. Russia reorientates Ukrainians successfully intercepted and attacked an advancing Russian tank column on Thursday as fighting picked up around Kyiv's northeast and east An overnight airstrike in the Brovary district, just east of the capital, caused no casualties, according to Kyiv authorities. Ukrainian authorities report a missile strike in the town of Baryshivka overnight some 45 miles east of the capital. ""According to preliminary information, the Iskander missile caused significant damage to infrastructure and housing. 60 apartment houses were completely damaged, 4 apartment buildings and 10 private houses were partially damaged,"" they said. Thomas Bullock, an analyst at Janes, a UK-based intelligence service, told CNN that ""Ukraine's tactic of targeting supply lines has worked well especially during the first five-10 days of the war. This was partially down to Ukrainian tactics and partially down to how Russia was operating."" The Russian forces ""prioritized rushing forward to secure objectives quickly"" in the first couple days of the invasion. This meant ""they weren't advancing as a coherent frontline securing territory as they go. This effectively allowed Ukrainian forces to slip behind Russia's advanced mechanized units and attack logistics columns traveling on unsecured roads in the rear."" But as ""Russia begins to reorient its forces for a longer war following their failure to secure a quick victory"" it is ""unclear how effective this tactic will be,"" Bullock added. The British Ministry of Defense update added that logistical issues continue to hamper the Russian advance ""as does strong Ukrainian resistance."" French armed forces spokesperson Pascal Ianni reiterated the UK assessment on Friday, saying the Russian army was poorly prepared for its invasion of Ukraine and is now facing many difficulties on the ground, ""particularly in the logistical field and in the field of intelligence,"" he told French TV station France2. ""It is possible that an attack on Kyiv will be carried out in the next few days, but actually taking control of Kyiv is a whole other matter and will take a long, long time,"" he said. The convoy is believed to have entered Ukraine via Belarus, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and where Russia moved huge numbers of troops to in recent weeks to carry out what they called joint exercises. When the exercises ended, the troops didn't leave and satellite images actually showed that Russia increased their military presence in the country. The convoy's dispersal comes after major cities in Ukraine -- including Dnipro in the center and Lutsk in the far west of the country -- were attacked by Russian forces Friday. As Ukrainian officials attempt to open evacuation routes on Friday around Kyiv, the United Nations said 2.5 million people had fled the country and 2 million people are displaced within Ukraine.",7,3.926775752203686,1.5209997717886348,2.4057759804150516,27
2022-03-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-11-intl/index.html,"Russia widens attack on Ukraine's cities, striking western airfields and Dnipro","Russian forces launched multiple missile attacks on a wide range of targets across Ukraine in the early hours of Friday, striking airfields in the far west of the country and, for the first time, hitting the central city of Dnipro, to which Ukrainians from other embattled cities have fled. The airport at Lutsk, some 70 miles from the Polish border, was reported to have suffered substantial damage in the attacks. The governor of Volyn region said four missiles had been fired from a Russian bomber and that two people were killed. Plumes of smoke also rose from the military airfield at Ivano-Frankivsk, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Lutsk. It was previously struck by missiles on the first day of the conflict. ""On the morning of March 11, high-precision long-range weapons attacked Ukraine's military infrastructure. The military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk were put out of action,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said Friday. Three Russian airstrikes also caused serious damage in and around the central city of Dnipro on Friday morning, killing one person, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in an official Telegram channel. One strike was near a preschool and an apartment building and another hit a shoe factory, causing a fire, the service said. Many Ukrainians evacuated in recent days from other cities under Russian fire had been taken to the relative safety of Dnipro. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said Friday it remains ""gravely concerned by the rising death toll and human suffering in Ukraine"" and called ""for an immediate end to the attacks."" ""Civilians are being killed and maimed in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks, with Russian forces using explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas,"" OHCHR spokeswoman Liz Throssell said in a statement. OHCHR said it has so far recorded 549 civilian deaths and 957 injuries since the invasion began on 24 February, ""although the actual figure could be much higher."" ""Schools, hospitals, and kindergartens have been hit -- with hugely devastating consequences,"" Throssell said. On March 3, 47 civilians were killed when Russian airstrikes hit two schools and several apartment blocks in Chernihiv and on March 9, a Russian airstrike hit a Mariupol hospital, injuring at least 17 civilians, she said. ""We are still investigating reports that at least three civilians may have been killed in the airstrike,"" she said. ""We spoke to different sources in Mariupol, including local authorities, indicating consistently that the hospital was both clearly identifiable and operational when it was hit."" Throssell also said OHCHR has received ""credible reports of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas."" The use of cluster munitions in populated areas is ""incompatible with the international humanitarian law,"" she said. Elsewhere, in the southern city of Mykolaiv, heavy shelling erupted on Friday evening. Social media videos showed fires in the area and Vitaliy Kim, Head of Mykolaiv Region Administration, said that there were ""active hostilities near Guryivka,"" to the north of the city. In a series of messages on his Telegram channel, Kim said the bombardment amounted to ""indiscriminate shooting at civilian targets,"" including a cafe and apartment block. And in the southeastern city of Melitopol, Mayor Ivan Fedorov was seen on video being led away by armed men from a government building on Friday. The prosecutor's office for the separatist, Russian-backed Luhansk region now says they are weighing terrorism charges against him. Fedorov's detention by the armed men is the first known instance of a Ukrainian political official being detained and investigated by Russian, or Russian-backed forces, since the invasion began. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry published a strongly worded statement on Facebook, calling Fedorov's detention an ""abduction"" and a ""war crime."" Meanwhile the number of people who have fled Ukraine continues to rise. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said Friday that the number of people who have left the country has now hit 2.5 million. Many others are still trapped in dire conditions as Russian forces bombard multiple cities. Ukrainian authorities said there was limited success Friday in securing the evacuation of civilians from areas worst affected by the fighting. Resistance persists In eastern Ukraine, there is growing evidence that the town of Volnovakha, has finally fallen to Russian forces and their allies in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic. The city had been surrounded almost since the beginning of Russia's invasion but had been fiercely defended by Ukrainian forces. Some social media videos from the city showed Russian soldiers and vehicles in several neighborhoods, as well as abandoned Ukrainian tanks. Other videos showed widespread destruction in Volnovakha, and the Russian defense ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, claimed the town had been taken. Russia has made some additional advances around the rest of the country in the past 24 hours, a senior US defense official told reporters on Friday. But the French government painted a less than rosy picture of the Russian military's progress. The Russian army was poorly prepared for its invasion of Ukraine and is now facing many difficulties on the ground, ""particularly in the logistical field and in the field of intelligence,"" French armed forces spokesperson Pascal Ianni told TV station France2 on Friday. ""It is possible that an attack on Kyiv will be carried out in the next few days, but actually taking control of Kyiv is a whole other matter and will take a long, long time,"" he said. ""The Russian army is also caught up in a premature spring,"" he added, with the defrosting ground causing mobility difficulties for the military. Britain's Ministry of Defence said on Friday that Russian forces continued to make ""limited progress"" in advancing toward Kyiv -- but could be preparing for a fresh attack against the Ukrainian capital in the coming days. ""It remains highly unlikely that Russia has successfully achieved the objectives outlined in its pre-invasion plan,"" the ministry said in an intelligence update. ""Logistical issues that have hampered the Russian advance persist, as does strong Ukrainian resistance."" Fighting intensified to the northeast and east of the capital Friday, after the Ukrainians successfully intercepted and attacked an advancing Russian tank column on Thursday. An overnight airstrike on the Brovary district just east of the capital caused no casualties, according to Kyiv authorities. Ukrainian authorities also reported a missile strike on the town of Baryshivka overnight into Friday, some 45 miles east of the city. A Russian column that had been stalled for nearly two weeks outside Kyiv has now dispersed, according to Maxar satellite imagery from Thursday. The forces appear to be regrouping. And a western defense official confirmed on Friday that a third Russian general had been killed by Ukrainian forces. He was named as Major General Andriy Kolesnikov, and was commander of the Eastern Military District, according to the Russian defense ministry website. The official noted for context that three Russian general staff officers were killed during the whole Syrian conflict. In Moscow, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that the invasion was being carried out successfully, despite claims from Western leaders that its military has encountered unplanned obstacles and resistance. ""All is going according to the plan, we report to you here every day this week,"" Shoigu told Russian President Vladimir Putin at a televised meeting of the country's security council. Shoigu claimed that the Russian army has received more than 16,000 applications from volunteers in the Middle East wanting to join the war in Ukraine. He also asked Putin for more weapons to arm the separatist regions of eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, including arms that Shoigu claimed the Russian army had seized from the Ukrainians. Putin supported both suggestions.",47,1.0984417088433143,4.799970738427259,-3.701529029583945,27
2022-03-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/politics/russia-ukraine-heavy-weaponry/index.html,US officials eye Russian reliance on unsophisticated but brutal heavy weaponry in Ukraine,"Russia has relied far more heavily on less sophisticated, so-called ""dumb"" bombs than it has on its arsenal of precision-guided munitions in its punishing war on Ukraine. It's a dynamic that US officials are watching closely for clues about the state of Russia's military — as these indiscriminate weapons kill scores of civilians. Russia has used a combination of missiles, artillery and rocket launchers to pummel major Ukrainian cities over the past two weeks, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. On Friday, Russia launched a barrage of missile attacks on a wide range of targets across central and western Ukraine, causing substantial damage and using what Russia's defense ministry said were ""high-precision long-range weapons."" But the number of ""precision-guided munitions that are being dropped from aircraft ... is small,"" Berrier said. US and Western officials say they don't know why Russia hasn't used more of these more sophisticated weapons, which its Su-34 fighter-bomber fleet regularly employed, along with other unguided bombs in Syria. It's an approach some US military and intelligence officials say could signal another surprising weakness in Russia's military campaign — or simply a terrifying willingness to employ brutal tactics that lead to countless civilian deaths in a war that many officials think could last weeks or even months. ""It's hard to say at this point whether that's driven by expense, if that's driven by a lack of inventory or if that's just driven by a desire to be more brutal in the use of force,"" a senior NATO official said on Thursday, calling it a ""big question."" Precision-guided munitions, or PGMs, are more expensive, time-consuming and complex to produce than unguided munitions and there has long been speculation that Russia's stockpile is relatively limited. It is possible, some outside analysts say, that Russia is simply holding its PGMs in reserve for later in the conflict — or as an emergency precaution in case Russia finds itself in conflict with NATO. One source familiar with the intelligence said that the Russia burned through the proportion of its PGM arsenal that it allocated for the operation in the early days of the conflict, when Moscow enforced stricter rules of engagement that eschewed widespread civilian casualties. But whatever the reason, officials say the impact is now being borne by Ukrainian hospitals, schools and apartment buildings destroyed by Russia's indiscriminate bombing campaign — even as a senior defense official cautioned on Wednesday that the US cannot prove whether guided or unguided munitions were used against a given target after the fact. The strategy may also create direct costs for Russia, according to one senior military official familiar with the latest intelligence. This person said that the use of some of Russia's ""dumb"" bombs requires its pilots to fly lower, making them more vulnerable to Ukraine's surprisingly effective anti-air defenses. Over the past several days, officials have noted a sharp decrease in overall Russian air activity over Ukraine. As the war enters its third week, Russian forces have been bogged down by not only a stiff Ukrainian resistance but myriad logistical and resupply missteps that Western officials have increasingly said show fundamental weaknesses in Russian planning and readiness. CIA Director Bill Burns on Tuesday said that Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion in part based on the assumption that his military was capable of a quick and decisive victory at minimal cost — one of several assumptions that Burns said had ""been proven wrong."" ""It is possible that we know more about the true state of fighting and the Russian readiness and capability at this point than Putin does himself,"" the senior NATO official said. Officials say there is still no question that Russia's military is vastly superior to Ukraine's fighting force and that Ukraine's prospects remain grim. Even in the face of Ukrainian resistance, Russia has made steady progress across the country. But intelligence officials have stopped predicting the imminent fall of Kyiv as the conflict has settled into a grinding war of attrition. The senior NATO official said he now believes the war may be measured in ""months to years,"" rather than days or weeks as Western officials has initially assessed. Russian problems Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said on Thursday that the US intelligence community had been caught by surprise by the clumsy execution of Putin's military strategy. ""We did well"" predicting that Putin had underestimated the resistance he would face in Ukraine, she said. ""We did not do as well in terms of predicting the military challenges that he has encountered with his own military."" US and Western officials say that it's difficult for them to nail down Russian losses, both in terms of battlefield casualties and destroyed equipment. Ukraine has reported that around 12,000 Russian soldiers have been captured or killed and more than 100 aircraft and helicopters, 317 tanks and over 1,000 armored personnel carriers have been eliminated. But even if those numbers can't be confirmed, officials say, it's clear that Russia has suffered significant troop and equipment losses. ""When you look at just the trash that is coming in from Russia on these train cars now, in terms of trucks and these little cars — they've got like civilian trucks and cars now on trains coming in to try to replace some of these heavier trucks that have been lost to Ukrainian counterattacks — that's amazing,"" said the senior NATO official. Russia's defense ministry on Wednesday also acknowledged that some conscripts were taking part in the war, while US officials say that Moscow is also seeking to recruit foreign fighters from Syria. Other foreign fighters, from Chechnya, are already in Ukraine, as is the mercenary group Liga, formerly known as the Wagner Group. Western officials see those supplementary forces as a potential sign that Russia is struggling to assemble sufficient combat power to continue its assault. ""We find that noteworthy that [Putin] believes that he needs to rely on foreign fighters to supplement what is a very significant commitment of combat power inside Ukraine as it is,"" a senior defense official told reporters on Thursday. Russia has also struggled to effectively supply its forward-deployed combat formations in the field with fuel, food and weapons. Russian forward-deployed units have often sprinted out ahead of their logistics train, leaving the support units vulnerable to Ukrainian counterattack. Meanwhile, a 40-mile convoy of Russian combat and logistics vehicles was stalled for days north of Kyiv, in part thanks to mechanical breakdowns and congestion and in part thanks to Ukrainian efforts to stymie its progress. However, by Thursday the convoy had ""largely dispersed and redeployed,"" according to Maxar Technologies satellite imagery. Still, despite Russian missteps, despite what officials have described as a heroic Ukrainian resistance, Western intelligence services are not assessing that Ukraine has turned the tide of the invasion. Russia's military remains qualitatively and quantitatively superior. Putin continues to carry out a sustained bombardment of Ukrainian cities with indiscriminate ""dumb"" bombs — including against civilian infrastructure — even in the face of international condemnation. Officials now believe that he is preparing to attempt to cut off food, water and potentially power supplies to Kyiv, as he has in other major cities within Ukraine. ""We see no signs that Putin has deviated from what his strategic political objectives are, nor do we see any signs that the military end states have changed,"" said the senior NATO official. ""The only major difference, aside from the miserable challenges that they're facing, is that they've just become more violent — not just against the military but against civilians.""",7,2.223644275546919,5.740998012222125,-3.517353736675206,23
2022-03-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/politics/us-patriot-missile-defense-system-explainer/index.html,These are the missile defense systems the US sent to Poland,"The two missile defense systems that the US delivered to Poland this week are part of a weapons system upon which the US military has heavily relied for nearly 40 years. The deployment, announced Thursday by Vice President Kamala Harris, is intended to deter Russia and boost Poland's security amid western concerns that the Ukraine conflict could spill into NATO-aligned nations. The Patriot air defense missile system -- Patriot stands for ""Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target"" -- is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, advanced aircraft and cruise missiles. The battery includes missiles and launching stations, a radar set that detects and tracks targets, and an engagement control station, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance. The US, seeking to avoid direct involvement in Ukraine -- which is not a member of NATO and therefore not subject to the pact's collective defense agreement, in which an attack on one aligned nation is considered an attack on all -- has repeatedly stressed that the deployment is only for defensive purposes. ""This defensive deployment is being conducted proactively to counter any potential threat to U.S. and Allied forces and NATO territory,"" Capt. Adam Miller, spokesman for US European Command, said in a statement Tuesday. ""This is a prudent force protection measure that underpins our commitment to Article Five and will in no way support any offensive operations."" The Pentagon's deployment of the Patriot missiles to Poland ""wasn't precipitated by one single moment or one single issue or one single act by the Russians,"" US Defense Department press secretary John Kirby said on Wednesday. The Patriot missiles had been moved from Germany for what Kirby described as a ""temporary deployment."" Retired US Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO commander, called the deployment of the two batteries ""prudent"" and said the Patriot system would be able to intercept many of the missiles Russian President Vladimir Putin has deployed in Russia and Belarus, which borders Poland. ""So if there were to be a launch in some provocative way by Mr. Putin to attempt to intimidate us, these missiles have a very good probability of intercepting a Russian missile,"" Clark, now a CNN military analyst, told CNN's Brianna Keilar. He added that the deployment of the equipment ""gives reassurance to the Poles. It also tells Putin that he's not going to be necessarily so successful in trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons."" A longtime mainstay of US military operations The Patriot missile system has undergone several improvements and upgrades since it was first deployed in 1982. Its first combat use was in the Gulf War, which was also the first time that an air defense system had destroyed a hostile tactical ballistic missile. The Patriot system was also deployed in 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom and was successful in hitting nine incoming missiles, but also were involved in several friendly fire incidents. In recent years, the US has sent Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia and Iraq to counter threats posed by Iran and its proxies and to the Pacific region to deter North Korea. Earlier this year, the US military, along with the United Arab Emirates, used the Patriot missiles to intercept attacks by Houthi militants on a military airbase where Americans were stationed and while the Israeli President was visiting the UAE. A 2019 Pentagon missile defense review reported that eight battalions with 33 batteries were stationed in the United States while seven battalions with 27 batteries were stationed overseas. More than a dozen US allies, including Germany, Japan, and Israel, have also purchased the US missile defense system.",49,4.514693109516259,8.099267555813386,-3.584574446297127,21
2022-03-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/politics/thomas-greenfield-russia-war-crimes/index.html,US ambassador to UN says Russia's actions in Ukraine 'constitute war crimes',"US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Thursday that actions committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people constitute war crimes, marking the first time a senior US official has directly accused Moscow of war crimes since last month's attack on Ukraine began. ""They constitute war crimes; there are attacks on civilians that cannot be justified by any -- in any way whatsoever,"" she said in an interview with BBC ""Newshour"" on Thursday morning. Other Biden administration officials have not gone as far as to declare outright that Russia has committed war crimes -- violations of international laws of armed conflict -- and instead have pointed to ""credible reports"" that such crimes have been carried out and their support for investigations into Moscow's actions. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday referenced ""atrocities"" committed by the Russians and said that the UN should investigate the allegations of Russian war crimes. Later on Thursday State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the US has ""seen very credible reports"" of Russian actions that would constitute war crimes, echoing comments made by Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday. Thomas-Greenfield said in the interview with the BBC that the question of whether Russia is guilty of war crimes is the one ""we're being asked every day, and we're working with others in the international community to document the crimes that Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people."" ""I still see images of a women being rolled out of a hospital, pregnant, bleeding, people screaming, children crying. It is just unconscionable. And we call on Russia to change course. They have to end this conflict, and they have to stop the fighting, and they have to return to diplomacy. And we have made clear our strong support for Ukrainians' call for this to stop,"" she added. Thomas-Greenfield said she couldn't predict how the war crimes would be prosecuted, but ""what is important is that we collect the evidence and have the evidence ready and available to be used."" The ambassador also indicated that the US is supportive of the International Criminal Court (ICC) probe of Russia's actions in Ukraine, despite the US not being a member of the ICC and criticizing other ICC investigations. ""We've always been supportive of the Criminal Court taking actions when actions are required,"" she said. Speaking at a State Department briefing later Thursday, Price also welcomed the ICC investigation, noting its focus on the preservation of evidence -- a key factor in making an official determination that war crimes have been committed. ""We want to see evidence preserved. We are and will be in the process of marrying reports with evidence from the ground, and if we determine, if the international community determines that war crimes have been committed, that atrocities have been committed, that human rights abuses have been committed, we absolutely will hold the perpetrators accountable, whether they sit in Moscow, or whether they're commanders on the ground in Ukraine,"" Price said. ""The fact is that we've seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would, under the Geneva Conventions, constitute a war crime,"" he said, citing attacks on the hospital in Mariupol and strikes on schools, hospitals, buses, cars and ambulances. Harris: Russia's attacks amounted to 'atrocities of unimaginable proportions' Harris, who spoke at a news conference alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Thursday morning, said that Russia's attacks in Ukraine amounted to ""atrocities of unimaginable proportions."" But, she stopped short of calling Russia's actions war crimes. ""We are also very clear that any intentional attack on innocent civilians is a violation,"" Harris said. ""The UN has set up a process by which there will be a review and investigations, and we will of course participate as appropriate and necessary,"" she added. ""I have no question the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities."" Duda was more direct, calling war crimes ""obvious"" in Ukraine and saying refugees coming to his country have evidence of it on their phones. A senior administration official said that Harris' comments were in line with the administration's position that the deliberate targeting of civilians would be defined as a war crime and should be investigated, saying she was referring to an investigation through the UN Commission of Inquiry. On Sunday, Blinken said that the US is looking into ""credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would constitute a war crime,"" but had not declared that the US had made the assessment that Moscow was guilty of war crimes. ""What we're doing right now is documenting all of this, putting it all together, looking at it, and making sure that as people and the appropriate organizations and institutions investigate whether war crimes have been or are being committed, that we can support whatever they're doing,"" Blinken said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""So right now we're looking at these reports. They're very credible. And we're documenting everything.""",45,5.496178772278503,2.792306102637145,2.703872669641358,3
2022-03-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-10-intl/index.html,"Mariupol children's hospital bombing one of many attacks on medical facilities since Russian invasion, WHO says","An injured woman, heavily pregnant, is carried on a stretcher past the smoldering wreckage of Mariupol's maternity and children's hospital. Her face is pale, one hand cradles her belly in a protective gesture. Every window on that side of the building appears to be blown out; wreckage litters the ground around it. The searing image was taken following a Russian airstrike on the hospital Wednesday that injured 17 people, including children, women and doctors, according to Mariupol city officials. Three people died, the city council said Thursday, among them, a child. The city in southeastern Ukraine has been besieged by Russian forces for days, its trapped residents forced to shelter underground, melt snow for water and scavenge for food. Now, even a hospital caring for pregnant women, newborns and children is not safe. Mariupol's Mayor Vadym Boychenko condemned Russia's ""cynical and destructive war against humanity,"" in a video message on Thursday. ""Every 30 minutes Mariupol was invaded by Russian aviation that was shooting at civilian buildings killing civilians: elderly, women and children,"" he said, adding, ""it's genocide that was created by the Russian army with Putin."" Mariupol's hospital wasn't the only children's medical facility that was damaged by Russian forces on Wednesday. Two hospitals in Zhytomyr, west of the capital, Kyiv, had their windows blown out in a Russian airstrike on a thermal power plant and civilian building in the city, the mayor said. One of them was a children's hospital. There were no casualties and everyone was in a bomb shelter, according to the city's mayor, Serhii Sukhomlyn. The rules of war specify that civilians should not be targeted and that medical workers, medical vehicles and hospitals dedicated to humanitarian work cannot be attacked. But in the past two weeks Russian forces have repeatedly struck medical facilities in Ukraine, prompting claims they are being systematically targeted, despite Russian denials. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been 24 verified attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine so far. ""These attacks have led to at least 12 deaths and 17 injuries. At least 8 of the injured and 2 of the killed were verified to be health workers. The attacks took place between 24 February and 8 March,"" WHO said Thursday. ""WHO strongly condemns these attacks. Attacks on health care violate international law and endanger lives. Even in times of conflict, we must protect the sanctity and safety of health care, a fundamental human right,"" it said in an email to CNN. A CNN crew in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, saw patients -- including sick children -- take cover in a hospital's underground bomb shelter as air raid sirens wailed. Stass, 12 years old and heavily bandaged, was unaware that his father was not with him in the hospital at that moment because he was burying the boy's mother and sister. ""I was in the neighbor's basement when the bomb hit the roof on my side,"" he said. ""We ran to my granny's house. Another hit there. My arm is broken. My dad and neighbor brought me here. I was in a coma for two days."" In a late-night video address Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the Mariupol hospital bombing as an ""atrocity"" and ""proof of a genocide of Ukrainians,"" as he renewed his calls on Western leaders to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He also called on Russia to explain why it was carrying out strikes on hospitals. ""Why were they a threat to the Russian Federation? What kind of country is the Russian Federation that is afraid of hospitals, afraid of maternity wards and destroys them?"" he said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday alleged without evidence the bombed hospital in Mariupol was the radical Azov battalion's base and that all patients and nurses had left. Later on Thursday, a Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson denied in a briefing that Russia had shelled the maternity hospital at all, calling it a ""provocation."" Lavrov said Russia informed the UN Security Council meeting about this a few days before the attack. The Azov battalion is integrated into the Ukrainian armed forces but was formerly an independent ultra-nationalist militia. ""On March 7 or 6, I don't remember exactly now, but at the meeting of the UN Security Council, our delegation presented facts that this maternity hospital had long been captured by the Azov battalion and other radicals,"" Lavrov said. ""All the women in labor, all the nurses, in general, all the staff was driven out of there,"" Lavrov added. Video from the hospital after the bombing clearly showed there were both patients and staff there, including pregnant women. A 'dire and desperate' situation The Mariupol hospital attack has sparked a flurry of international condemnation, with French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal calling it ""inhumane"" and ""unjustifiable"" in comments Thursday. ""I want to say in the name of the French government that the strike by Russia against Mariupol's pediatric hospital was inhumane and cowardly. It's women, children, healthcare workers who were targeted, it's unjustifiable,"" he said in an interview with French radio station RTL. Calling again for a ceasefire in Ukraine, Attal predicted the worst was yet to come in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also condemned the strike in Mariupol, saying: ""There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenseless."" The United Nations said it was following up ""urgently"" on ""shocking reports"" of the bombing of the hospital. ""It bears reminding that we have called, WHO has called for an immediate halt to attacks on health care, hospitals, health care workers, ambulances -- none of these should ever, ever be a target,"" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday. The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine ""continues to deteriorate rapidly,"" Dujarric added. More than 2.2 million people have crossed international borders escaping Ukraine since the invasion began, Dujarric said. In Mariupol itself, the situation is becoming ""increasingly dire and desperate,"" the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Thursday. It warned that ""hundreds of thousands of people have no food, water, heat, electricity, or medical care,"" and said that ""people urgently need respite from violence and humanitarian aid."" ""All the shops and pharmacies were looted four to five days ago. Some people still have food but I'm not sure for how long it will last,"" the deputy head of sub-delegation of ICRC Sasha Volkov said in a interview recorded Wednesday and published on the ICRC website. Many people in Mariupol have reported having no food for children, Volkov said. ""People started to attack each other for food. People started to ruin someone's car to take the gasoline out."" Disturbing pictures from an Associated Press photographer showed bodies being lowered into a mass grave in the city on Wednesday, some encased in body bags but others apparently wrapped only in blankets. At least 1,300 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since the Russian invasion began, an adviser to the city's mayor said Wednesday. CNN cannot independently verify these casualty figures. Zelensky warned Russian propagandists they ""will be held responsible for complicity with war crimes"" in a video message Thursday. ""Russian citizens will hate you for consistently lying to them for many years. When they will feel the consequences of your lies, feel with their wallets, their dwindling opportunities, with the stolen futures of the Russian children,"" he said, adding that the aggressor also pays a price in war. His warning came after Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova on Wednesday called for a ""new model"" of investigative efforts to tackle alleged war crimes in Ukraine. And for those trying desperately to flee Russian attacks, evacuation efforts continue to be fragile and fleeting. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of violating agreed pauses in hostilities. On Thursday morning, the Ukrainian government said that it was opening evacuation corridors -- designed to allow civilians to escape to safer regions -- in several parts of the country. Later that day, Zelensky said about 100,000 people have been evacuated through the corridors over the past two days. Mariupol and the city of Volnovakha however, remain completely blocked, he said, adding that despite Ukrainian officials' best efforts to make the corridor work, ""Russian troops did not cease fire."" Meanwhile, a meeting between Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Lavrov in Turkey ended Thursday without an agreement reached on evacuation corridors or a ceasefire, Kuleba said. At a news conference following the meeting, Kuleba said he had raised the prospect of establishing a corridor to allow civilians to flee from the besieged city of Mariupol but ""unfortunately Minister Lavrov was not in a position to commit himself to it.""",47,5.065920232094891,4.454527851664665,0.6113923804302264,24

The attack came despite Russia agreeing to a 12-hour pause in hostilities to allow refugees to evacuate a number of towns and cities. Mariupol city council posted a video of the devastated hospital in the city and accused Russian forces of dropping several bombs on it from the air. ""The destruction is enormous,"" said the council. ""The building of the medical facility where the children were treated recently is completely destroyed."" Police in the Donetsk region said that according to preliminary information at least 17 people were injured, including mothers and staff, as a result of the attack. Zelensky repeated his call for the NATO military alliance to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine, as he expressed his outrage at the attack. ""Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,"" he said on Telegram. ""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,"" Zelensky said, adding, ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?"" Later Wednesday, Zelensky called the strike ""final proof, proof of a genocide of Ukrainians taking place."" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed, without providing evidence, that Ukrainian forces had ""equipped combat positions"" within the hospital.

Images on social media show significant destruction at the University and City Council Building. The strategic port city of Mariupol on Ukraine's southeast coast has been under siege for days and has been ""isolated"" by Russian forces, a senior US defense official said Tuesday. Russia continues to bombard Mariupol and its troops are not inside the city ""in any significant way,"" added the official. Two officials said Wednesday that about 1,300 civilians there have been killed since the Russian invasion began. Residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days, and on Tuesday Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia of committing war crimes by holding 300,000 civilians ""hostage."" ""The situation in Mariupol is desperate,"" Mirella Hodeib, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told CNN on Monday. Evacuation corridors On Wednesday, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said both sides had agreed to a ceasefire and planned evacuation corridors from a number of cities in order to allow people to leave. The attempted evacuation corridors were scheduled to operate from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m local time, with routes including Energodar to Zaporizhia; Mariupol to Zaporizhia; Volnovakha to Pokrovsk; Izium to Lozova; and four separate routes from Vorzel, Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, and Gostomel to the capital city of Kyiv. A corridor also operated between Sumy and Poltava, a route that enabled about 5,000 Ukrainians to evacuate on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian Presidential Office Deputy Kirill Timoshenko. But several hours after the evacuation was due to begin, there was no sign of people being brought out of Vorzel, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Irpin and Bucha in the bus convoys that had been organized. The city council of Bucha accused Russian forces of blocking the evacuation in a statement on Facebook. ""The occupants are disrupting the evacuation. Currently, 50 buses are blocked by Russian military in the parking lot,"" the post read. An attempted evacuation from Demidova, a town north of Kyiv that was not among the agreed corridors, ran into trouble. One police officer was killed and two more people seriously injured during an attempted evacuation of civilians, according to regional authorities. In the east, it was impossible to evacuate civilians from the town of Izium ""as we constantly hear explosions,"" said Oleh Syniehubov, administrative head of Kharkiv region. However, greater progress appeared to be made in organizing buses to get people out of the central city of Enerhodar, as well as Irpin and Vorzel. ""The evacuation from the city continues,"" wrote Оleksandr Markushyn, mayor of Irpin, on Facebook. ""There are buses in the center of Irpin. We are evacuating as many people as possible."" In Vorzel, all of the children that had been stranded in an orphanage have been evacuated, as has the local maternity hospital, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser in the president's office. At least 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, the UN estimates. But millions more remain trapped in towns and cities that have come under sustained attacks by Russian forces in recent days. And on Tuesday Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov claimed more than 400 civilians have been killed, including 38 children, with the real death toll expected to be higher. Reznikov accused Russia of ""a real act of genocide"" and ""war crimes,"" claiming that Russian forces had fired on the evacuation corridors. Kharkiv encircled The city of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine is encircled by Russian forces and continues to suffer heavy shelling, the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted Wednesday. On Tuesday, Kharkiv Mayor Igot Terekhov told CNN the situation was ""difficult"" and there was ""constant shelling from heavy artillery"" on residential neighborhoods and civilian infrastructure. ""They're hitting our water and heating and gas supply,"" said Terekhov. ""They're trying to interrupt our power supplies."" Kharkiv is home to 1.5 million people, said Terekhov, adding that utility services were working to keep people warm as cold weather approaches. Terekhov said he regards indiscriminate shelling as ""an act of genocide."" He added that any aid or assistance would be gratefully received, and expressed hope about the ultimate outcome. ""I am absolutely confident that we will defeat the Russians,"" he added. Zelensky calls for action to prevent 'catastrophe' Russian forces also continue to bear down on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and on Tuesday the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, Oleksiy Kuleba, said the humanitarian situation in areas around the city remains difficult. ""The main issue today remains humanitarian aid. Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka, Vorzel - residents of these settlements are forced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food. The occupiers do not give humanitarian corridors, do not give guarantees,"" Kuleba said, naming five districts to the north and west of Kyiv. On Wednesday, these five districts were named among evacuation corridors agreed by Ukraine and Russia. Also on Wednesday, Zelensky repeated his call for military intervention from Western allies. ""Ukraine has been saying this to its partners from the first day of the war: If you don't close the skies, you will also be responsible for this catastrophe, a massive humanitarian catastrophe,"" he said. The Ukrainian government has meanwhile announced that it will ban exports on key agricultural goods, including wheat, corn, grains, salt, and meat, after passing a cabinet resolution Tuesday. Ukraine's minister of agrarian policy and food, Roman Leshchenko, said the steps had been taken ""to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine"" and ""meet the needs of the population in critical food products.""",47,1.9108717015385115,5.15793837268319,-3.2470666711446783,24
2022-03-09,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/russia-ukraine-pentagon-nato/index.html,Pentagon shores up its NATO defenses in Europe,"With continued worry that Russia's bloody invasion of Ukraine could spill over into neighboring countries, the Pentagon is putting in place the military infrastructure needed to help run a war in Europe and meet President Joe Biden's pledge to defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory, according to several defense officials. The Pentagon has deployed thousands of additional troops to Europe, including 500 more US troops announced Monday. The US is sending defensive weapons like Patriot missiles to Poland and considering moving additional assets to protect other allies like Romania and the Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia from any Russian moves on their borders, officials say. A spokesman for US European Command told CNN on Tuesday evening that the United States is sending two Patriot missile batteries to Poland as a ""defensive deployment"" to counter any potential threat to US and NATO allies. The Pentagon estimates that as many as half of the 670 missiles Russia has fired against Ukraine have been launched from inside that country, raising concerns that it can more easily reach NATO countries if it chooses to lash out or expand the scope of the war. In all, the US has repositioned nearly 15,000 military personnel in reaction to Russian aggression. The total number of US troops in Europe is now expected to reach 100,000. The US effort comes along with a dramatically stepped-up NATO deterrence, as any US military operation would almost certainly be under a NATO umbrella. ""We have 130 jets at high alert. Over 200 ships from the high north to the Mediterranean, and thousands of additional troops in the region,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday while traveling in Latvia. The latest deployment includes an ""air support"" operations center heading to Poland and Romania, as well as refueling and maintenance specialists to Germany to bolster US and NATO air operations over the region. The Army's Fifth Corps also is deploying 300 headquarters troops to Poland and Germany to provide command and control for US ground forces. The US Navy briefly positioned a carrier in the northern Aegean Sea this week that could be used in a contingency for flight operations should tensions escalate. Allthe troop movements had long been expected, a senior defense official insisted. But there is no question it's all about protecting against any possible Russian incursion into NATO member nations. While the US is adamant about its intent to avoid a direct conflict, the Pentagon's deployments are aimed at putting a military structure in place both to deter Russia from widening the scope of its war and to prepare against a deliberate or accidental spillover of the fighting into NATO territory. ""One of the things that we've talked about is how important protecting NATO territory is, and that includes NATO airspace,"" a defense official told CNN. In the air, dozens of US aircraft -- including advanced F-35s fighter jets and intelligence and reconnaissance planes -- are conducting daily patrols on both deterrence and intelligence collection missions, while staying outside Ukrainian airspace and out of the reach of Russian anti-aircraft weapons. Protecting against a wider war Biden and top US officials have repeatedly stressed that US troops will not fight in Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO. At the same time, however, senior US officials have continued to reiterate that the US commitment to defend fellow NATO countries in the event of an attack is ""sacrosanct."" NATO's Article 5 doctrine says that any attack on one NATO country is an attack on all -- meaning the US and other European allies would be obligated to come to the defense of any NATO member attacked by Russia. The moves are a recognition that the US military has to be prepared for the contingencies that the biggest land war in Europe since World War II may not remain confined to Ukraine's borders. Part of the concern among US officials is that Russian President Vladimir Putin could decide to attack NATO nations, especially if he feels backed into a corner. Last week, the Kremlin put forward a list of ""de facto unfriendly countries,"" including the US. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, the US and its allies have imposed a series of punishing financial sanctions on Russia, which Putin has since likened to a ""declaration of war."" Russia has also issued increasingly threatening rhetoric about countries that send weapons to Ukraine. On Tuesday, the Pentagon dismissed a plan floated by the Polish government to deploy its MiG-29 fighter jets to a US base in Germany so they could be delivered to Ukraine. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the proposal was not ""tenable,"" in part because the prospect of fighter jets ""departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance."" Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a national security and military analyst for CNN, said the Biden administration's reinforcement of NATO is important both to assuage the fears of NATO countries that had worried in the past about the US military's commitment to Europe and to send a clear message of deterrence to Putin. ""Putin went into this whole thing with Ukraine thinking the US wouldn't do anything, and I think he's very surprised at what he's seeing right now,"" Hertling said. ""I don't think Putin is stupid enough to go one on one against NATO ... but if he does, he will be outgunned and outmanned, other than nuclear weapons."" An umbrella of air defense As anxiety mounts in Eastern Europe that the Russians could launch a potential attack against NATO's eastern flank, the US is increasing its defensive missile capabilities there, according to a US official familiar with current administration thinking. ""The US is considering a range of capabilities,"" the official said. Along with the move of Patriot missile batteries to Poland, potential shipments could also include the THAAD anti-missile systems, which have successfully been used in the Middle East to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles There is no specific plan yet, but the idea centers on the concern that Russian missiles or aircraft might attack targets inside NATO territory at some point if Putin decides the support of those nations for Ukraine threatens his plans there. And because of the close proximity of the airspace, there is also concern that air defense be available if Russian aircraft inadvertently stray into NATO airspace. The establishment of a so-called US-Russia deconfliction line was in part to address those worries. But there is a sense an umbrella of air defense is needed, not just a means of communication. Because of the defensive nature of these systems, the US will emphasize that Russia should have no concerns. US naval preparations US naval forces are also scoping out how they might respond to Russian aggression. The aircraft carrier Harry S Truman has been in the northern Aegean Sea this week in part to ensure it can conduct flight operations from there if tensions escalate in the region, according to a US official familiar with the carrier's current task. The official did not disclose the exact location of the ship but noted it's not routine to operate in the Aegean's northernmost waters. The area is relatively confined for carrier operations due to the number of small islands and heavy commercial maritime traffic. ""In the event of further escalation,"" the Navy could be told to project more fighter jet air patrols into the Black Sea, the official said. ""If Russia sought to run the Turkish strait and Turkey asked for NATO support,"" then carrier aircraft could be used for combat air patrols over the Black Sea and Strait of Dardanelles. Turkey administers passage permission to transit into the Black Sea for warships and there is concern about Russia's future plans there, so keeping that waterway open would be part of any potential US and NATO effort if Turkey requests help.

2022-03-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/europe/russian-general-killed-ukraine-kharkiv-intl/index.html,Ukraine claims Russian general has been killed in Kharkiv,"The Ukrainian defense ministry has claimed that a Russian general was killed in battle near Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv. The short statement on Monday offered no proof of the death of Maj. Gen. Vitaly Gerasimov, and gave no details of when he was killed. Russian state media said nothing Tuesday about Gerasimov, although it did name other Russians killed in Ukraine. CNN has not been able to independently verify Ukraine's claim, and Russia's defense ministry did not immediately respond to CNN's questions about Gerasimov on Tuesday, which is a national holiday in Russia. The United States also cannot confirm the Ukrainian claims, a senior US defense official said Tuesday. Ukraine identified Gerasimov as ""a Russian military commander, major general, chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 41st Army of the Central Military District of Russia"" and said he was a veteran of Russian campaigns in Chechnya and Syria. ""A number of senior Russian army officers were also killed and wounded,"" the Ukrainian defense ministry statement said. The Ukrainian ministry also alluded in its statement to communication problems that it says Russia's army is facing. The executive director of the open source investigative outlet Bellingcat, Christo Grozev, detailed in a Twitter thread that the information of the general's death may have been gleaned from an intercept of a phone call on an unsecured network. CNN has been unable to confirm those details. Franz Stefan Gady, research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), told CNN the reported death of the general is ""testimony to the ferocity of the fighting near Kharkiv,"" though he added that Ukrainian reports of the deaths of senior Russian officers remained murky. Gady also said it was an indication that senior Russian officers ""need to be leading from the front to regroup and consolidate their forces,"" and to ""push their soldiers forward to attack,"" amid low troop morale. He suggested that such an approach could lead to other reports of high-ranking military deaths. Russian forces have been launching sustained strikes on Kharkiv for in recent days. Shelling from heavy artillery, air raids and fire on residential districts has left the key northeastern city devastated but it has not yet fallen to the Russians. Russian troops are still facing Ukrainian resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country, according to a senior US defense official. The city's mayor Igor Terekhov told CNN's New Day on Tuesday: ""Kharkiv currently has water supply and heating supplies to all the buildings that are still standing except for those that have been destroyed."" Describing the attacks as a ""genocide"", Terekhov asked: ""What else can it be? There is no military infrastructure, no military facilities in these areas. Strikes are happening in kindergartens, schools, maternity hospitals, clinics. ""This isn't an accident. I can understand when there's an accidental strike. But when it's hundreds of civilian buildings hit, that is no accident. That is a targeted attack,"" he alleged. In a post on Facebook Sunday, Kharkiv's regional administration said ""repeated shelling"" of the city's TV tower had knocked out TV and radio broadcasting. The Kremlin has denied targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, despite multiple documented casualties.",7,4.492561332133019,2.2105881442363553,2.281973187896664,25
2022-03-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-08-intl/index.html,"Civilians flee Sumy after evacuation corridor opens, as 2 million refugees leave Ukraine","A tense and fleeting evacuation from Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy took place on Tuesday after Russian airstrikes killed 21 people, including two children, the night before, Ukrainian authorities said. Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow's invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city's regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy. ""At the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,"" Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. ""After 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy."" The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians ""hostage"" in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration. Ukrainian authorities said that a long-awaited convoy of humanitarian aid to the city appeared to have come under fire on Tuesday. Russian troops are not allowing ""children, women and the elderly"" out of the city, and have launched an attack ""precisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,"" Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation said. CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response. A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been ""isolated"" by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it ""in any significant way."" CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days. Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught. ""The main issue today remains humanitarian aid,"" Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video. Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are ""forced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,"" he said, adding that Moscow is preventing ""humanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation."" On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces ""violated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,"" following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army's advance in northern Ukraine. That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing ""several civilians"" trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Zelensky calls for help as Ukrainians flee west Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the ""sidelines"" of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK's House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that ""we will fight to the end,"" echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famous wartime speech. ""We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,"" he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to ""strengthen the sanctions"" against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia ""as a terrorist state"" and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a ""responsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine"" during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits. ""That would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,"" said Stoltenberg. ""The situation could spiral out of control,"" he said. On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. ""In order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,"" Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. ""If the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility."" The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched ""nearly 670"" missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, ""the other half largely from inside Ukraine,"" the official said. ""A little bit more than 70"" missiles have been fired from Belarus, and ""only a half dozen or so"" are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. A humanitarian crisis keeps growing Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia's invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. The milestone is a ""terrifying"" number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries ""where they have connections, family,"" he added. ""What worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,"" said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.",47,3.8555218990307285,1.6215096488208451,2.2340122502098834,24
2022-03-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/india/indian-students-stuck-sumy-ukraine-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,Bus to nowhere: Indian students sent back to bunker after failed Sumy evacuation,"Indian university student Niranjana Santhosh was so close to being evacuated from the bombarded Ukrainian city of Sumy on Monday that she was sitting on a bus with her bags packed, waiting for the driver to start the engine. But three hours later, she and dozens of other Indian students who had hoped to be ferried to a safer city, away from Russian attacks, received a WhatsApp message from the Indian embassy with devastating news. A temporary ceasefire negotiated between Russia and Ukraine to allow civilians to flee four cities, including Sumy, had failed. ""We are so sad and desperate,"" Santhosh, who left the bus to return to the hostel above the dank, dark bunker where hundreds of students have huddled for days with little food and no electricity. Some are so thirsty they're melting snow to drink. The failed evacuation raises pressure on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring the students home as anger grows and Russia's invasion intensifies with attacks on residential and civilian targets. Modi spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday about the students' plight, according to a statement from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. Russia claims it is willing to cease its offensive, and open corridors to allow citizens to leave a small number of cities, including Sumy. However, Ukraine has rejected that on the basis Ukrainians would be evacuated to Russia or its ally Belarus and would require people to travel through active areas of fighting. Ukrainian and Western leaders have also accused Russia of repeatedly sabotaging rescue efforts by continuing to target pre-approved safe routes. On Sunday, a Russian strike hit an evacuation crossing point outside Kyiv, killing eight people including two children trying to flee. In Sumy, the Indian students -- like millions of Ukrainians in cities across the country -- are growing increasingly desperate to escape Russia's attacks. ""I'm mentally exhausted,"" Santhosh said. ""We are just living with hope."" On Tuesday, Indian Cabinet Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the evacuation of all students in Sumy to Poltava, a city 100 miles away, was underway. ""As we are speaking the evacuation is going on,"" Puri told reporters Tuesday evening Indian local time. Uncertainty and fear Merlyn Shebu arrived in Ukraine just over two months ago, excited about studying her first year of medicine at Sumy State University. But for nearly two weeks, she's been sheltering with other students in a dusty bunker beneath their hostel. Sewage water flows through the cold and damp room and fungus grows up the walls. There are no toilets, and students have no place to even sleep on the uneven concrete floor in freezing temperatures. ""We are in a desperate situation. We don't know who will come and help us,"" 21-year-old Shebu told CNN last week. ""Please evacuate us soon before our life ends here."" More than 2,000 international students from 27 countries, including China and Turkey, remain stranded in Sumy, according to a tweet from Ukrainian lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko posted Tuesday. She said Russian had refused a ""green"" corridor and told the students to ""hold tight, #Ukraine army will be there soon."" The Indian students who spoke to CNN from Sumy say they are studying in Ukraine because many of them didn't qualify for the limited places at Indian medical schools, and university fees in Ukraine are significantly cheaper than private universities in India. According to data from UNESCO, more than 14,000 Indians are currently enrolled in Ukraine universities -- the single largest group of foreign students in the country. Now only about 700 remain, according to the Indian government. Most are in Sumy -- Indian students in other cities were advised to leave Ukraine as tension built before the invasion. ""I think we will go back to India only after we die,"" 23-year-old medical student Mahtab Raza told CNN from Sumy last week, his voice quivering in fear. ""We have been imploring the government to rescue us for days. Everyone is crying, everyone is scared."" On Saturday, a group of students became so desperate to leave they threatened to walk 37 miles (60 kilometers) to the Russian border, braving Russian gunfire and damaged roads and bridges. ""If anything happens to us, all the responsibility will be on the Indian embassy,"" Mariya Munaf, a 22-year-old student, said on a video message as she stood with at least 100 students, some holding Indian flags. CNN contacted the Ministry of External Affairs multiple times to ask what was being done to evacuate the students in Sumy but officials declined to comment. 'I survive on water' The Indian government issued urgent advisories for nationals to evacuate Kyiv and Kharkiv on February 15 and make their way to the western Ukrainian border. But the students in Sumy say they weren't given clarity about their situation -- until Saturday. Calls to the Indian embassy's helpline went unanswered for days, they said. They fear either dying in their bunker or being shot outside, like another Indian student, Naveen Gyanagoudar, who was killed by Russian shelling last week while buying groceries in the city of Kharkiv. ""After Naveen's death, I started eating once a day,"" said Shweta Raj, a 22-year-old medical student. ""What if something happens to me while I'm standing in line (to get food)? So I eat once a day. I eat very little. I survive on water."" Back home in India, Gyanagoudar's death sparked political debate. Opposition parties criticized the Indian government's evacuation efforts, saying they needed to be better planned. Some repeated demands from the West for India to take a stronger stand against Russia. So far, Delhi has abstained from voting on multiple UN Security Council resolutions demanding Moscow stop its attack on Ukraine. Delhi has been reticent to condemn Russia due to its defense ties with Moscow, according to Donald Lu, the US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs. India relies on Russia for at least 50% of its military equipment -- a relationship given an increased level of importance in recent years owing to India's fraught relationship with neighbors Pakistan and China. At the same time, India is a member of Quad -- an informal defense alliance with the United States, Japan and Australia -- who have all imposed sanctions against Russia. ""All of us have been working to urge India to take a clear position, a position opposed to Russia's actions. But what have we seen so far? We have seen a number of abstentions,"" Lu said during a Senate subcommittee hearing about US-India relations on March 2. Modi has appealed to Putin for a ""cessation"" of the violence -- but has fallen short of condemning his unprovoked attack. India has also pledged humanitarian aid to Ukraine and Modi has spoken with Zelensky about the crisis. Last week, as pressure mounted on Modi, some of his supporters questioned why Gyanagoudar had ignored the government's advisories to leave and whether he was waiting for a ""private jet"" to bring him back. In a speech on February 26, before Gyanagoudar's death, Modi himself questioned why Indian students go abroad for studies, although he didn't directly refer to the Ukraine crisis. ""Our students today are going to small countries, especially for medical education. Language is a problem there... large sums of Indian money is going abroad,"" he said. His comments struck a nerve with some students stranded in Ukraine, who say they feel betrayed by his response. ""How can you say that Prime Minister? how can you say that?"" Raj, the first-year medical student said. ""We were looking forward to you (helping us), and you just said why (do) we go?"" On Monday, T. S. Tirumurti, India's Ambassador to the United Nations, emphasized India's desire for a peaceful outcome in Ukraine. ""India has been consistent in calling for an immediate end to all hostilities,"" Tirumurti said. ""We have also reiterated our urgent demand for safe and uninterrupted passage for all innocent civilians including Indian nationals remaining in Ukraine. We're deeply concerned that despite our repeated urgings to both sides, the safe corridor for our students stranded in Sumy did not materialize."" On Tuesday, Ukraine and Russia agreed a single corridor to allow civilians to evacuate Sumy south via Holubivka and Lokhvytsia to the city of Poltava. ""We call on Russia to agree on these routes immediately and ensure a stable ceasefire on these routes,"" Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories said in a statement. Indian embassy officials are waiting stationed in Poltava to help with the evacuation, the embassy said on Twitter Sunday. But the students fear they are running out of time. ""Please don't let another Naveen die,"" Raj said. ""It is very scary, we are away from our parents and no one is here to protect us.""",47,1.8616418159166606,3.067258940597474,-1.2056171246808134,1
2022-03-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/europe/russia-southern-ukraine-military-analysis-intl/index.html,Putin's clumsy military campaign in southern Ukraine makes little sense,"Each morning I hope it will be easier to process. But nearly a fortnight into this war, the conflict still seems surreally distant and alarmingly beyond comprehension. Try to ask yourself ""how is this happening?"" and you lurch out over an abyss so profound it is beyond the reach of your senses. And even if Putin does think he can get his old empire back, how do these 13 days of savagery make that happen? The slow and clumsy Russian campaign for the south has been the most baffling. It is clear what Moscow wants: To cut off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea. What is hard to fathom is whether the Kremlin's plan to get it has collapsed, and Russian troops are just throwing rockets and tanks at anything they can, or whether this sort of total war against Ukrainians was always the plan. The city of Kherson was the first to ""fall,"" but that was not really what happened. As we watched the fight for the strategic bridge to the city's east, I tried to reassure locals that the Russian army had no interest in their homes and would drive on by, eager to get to Odessa, further west. But I was wrong -- again -- about the extent of Moscow's ambitions. (I have, since the first intelligence warnings about a full Russian invasion of Ukraine, felt the idea was so preposterous it must be born of an intelligence failure, not a historic intelligence success). Russian troops did enter the city of Kherson, where they were reported to have looted shops, arrested men, and shot in the air at protestors. The residents here call them ""Orcs"" -- the lumbering monsters from the Lord of the Rings. It is a marvel that Moscow was either so convinced civil disobedience would not be a problem or decided that they simply did not need a plan to deal with it. The Kremlin's attempt to film Russian aid trucks handing out the solution to the problem its invasion created was greeted with local scorn and profanity. The protests go on. The port of Mykolaiv is next on the Russian route to Odessa, Ukraine's third-largest city. The Russian ""plan"" for Mykolaiv is even more disconcertingly opaque. Shelling is a big part of it; over a week they have hit civilian targets there multiple times. Last weekend, when their missiles blew out the windows and roofs of civilian buildings as a consequence of a strike on Ukrainian armor in the city center, that may have been by accident. But this weekend -- even at the most generous assessment -- it was through carelessness so extreme it was surely criminal. They seem to just be lobbing rockets, into the city's suburbs, CNN seeing three instances where apparent cluster munitions had landed in residential areas. NATO on Friday said it had seen the use of cluster bombs by Russia in Ukraine. And again and again on Mykolaiv's outskirts, the Russians keep coming. The attacks seem to falter every time. At one roundabout, we saw a Russian Tigr armored vehicle on fire on Saturday, Ukrainian troops lying in defensive prone positions around it. Some 24 hours later, at the same spot, Ukrainian troops had found time to graffiti the unexploded rockets that landed around them with anti-Putin abuse, and the Russians had been pushed further back down the road. Farmers were clambering over an abandoned T90 tank, trying to get it started and quite quickly diagnosing it had a steering problem. That, and the tank having been trapped the ruins of a collapsed bridge, perhaps explains why it had been abandoned. But this was not a rare occasion. On Sunday, the regional governor Vitali Kim posted a video of himself inside another captured Russian Tigr vehicle. Another video showed what seemed to be a significant Russian artillery unit in flames, destroyed or abandoned. The person filming joked that the scarred machines' remains were what ""is what's left of our 'brothers,' the ones that came to 'save us'"" -- a reference to Moscow's gibberish assertion that it is engaged in a special operation to demilitarize and ""de-Nazify"" Ukrainians subjugated under a vile regime. The Kremlin's propaganda -- for years something so concentrated and cynical that it found its way into the information ecosystem, and even turned some souls -- is dismissed with the same disregard with which it was authored. It really is just nonsense, and it is refreshing to see most sensible media not even give it oxygen. Odessa is the prize on the coast. On Monday morning as the city was blasted with horizontal snow, the sirens rang out, enflaming residents' fears of a Russian amphibious landing. Those last three words sound ridiculous here, in a city with hipster dumpling stores hidden in stairwells, and a series of road signs that tell any new Russian arrivals to ""f**k off"" (straight ahead), ""also to f**k off"" (left) and to ""f**k off back to Russia"" (right). The entire Russian project in Ukraine is the stuff of a malarial nightmare. Putin's plan still doesn't make sense. Did the Kremlin genuinely think that Ukraine would collapse in a week, its citizens welcoming them in? If so, then why has the strategy swung so rapidly toward a form of collective punishment once it became clear they were not welcome at all? Was there no plan for something in between appreciation and annihilation? Why are the Russian units we see trying again and again to hit the same targets, often using very similar approaches? Why are so many abandoning their vehicles and accepting capture? And why is the Russian air force, for years flaunted as Putin's new hi-tech toy, proving so very ineffective? There is a temptation to seek rational answers to these questions. The reason we are in this dark place is the failure of the rational to dominate in the Kremlin. We just do not know how far Putin -- who over the course of two weeks has tried to encircle a capital city, placed his strategic nuclear defenses on a higher level of alert, used cluster munitions and attacked a nuclear power plant -- will go. Again and again, the war fails to make sense. It seems to be outside the reaches of what I thought our shared reality was. We can only hope it does not stay that way.",47,2.408137542541321,2.254831947996398,0.1533055945449231,23
2022-03-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/europe/ukraine-russia-weekend-summary-intl/index.html,What happened in Russia's Ukraine invasion over the weekend,"The human toll of the invasion of Ukraine mounted over the weekend as Russia upped its bombardment of civilian areas and infrastructure. As conditions worsened in a number of key Ukrainian cities, the United Nations said more than 1.5 million refugees had fled the country so far. Here's what you need to know about what happened over the weekend. Key cities bombarded as plans for evacuation corridors fail Western intelligence officials say Russia is increasing the pace and strength of strikes on key population centers, including the capital Kyiv, in an effort to bombard cities into submission. A Russian military strike hit an evacuation crossing point in the Kyiv suburb of Irpin Sunday, killing eight people, including a family with two children and several other civilians trying to flee the Russian invasion. The harrowing scenes were captured by international media, including the New York Times, filming at the checkpoint. They reported a shell landed as a stream of civilians was coming through. Heavy shelling has continued around Kyiv. The impact of explosions was heard over the weekend by CNN teams in the capital and in rural areas to the southwest. Amid the indiscriminate attacks, Kyiv appealed for international help on Sunday, saying thousands of people were isolated ""because of direct hostilities, and in some places for 5-6 days they survive without electricity, water, food, medical help and means of subsistence. They are in direct danger,"" the Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote. For the past week, civilians in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, have witnessed Russia's bombardment of residential areas as its military hones in on civilian infrastructure such as schools, shops, hospitals, apartment blocks and churches. This continued over the weekend as Kharkiv's TV tower was targeted in strikes, knocking out television and radio broadcasts, according to local authorities. Ukraine's Emergency Service said a ""bombing"" that took place on Sunday evening ""completely or partially demolished"" multi-story residential buildings, administrative buildings, medical institutions, educational institutions and dorms. There were also large-scale fires in 21 buildings in the central part of the city, it added in a statement. Meanwhile, hopes of setting up evacuation corridors for civilians in the southern city of Mariupol were dashed multiple times over the weekend after Ukraine accused Russia of continuing its attacks on those routes. Mariupol, a strategically important port city, has been under siege by Russian forces determined to tighten their grip on Ukraine's south. The city has been without power for days, and it's not clear how many of Mariupol's roughly 400,000 inhabitants have been able to evacuate. But on Sunday the International Committee of the Red Cross said attempts to evacuate some 200,000 people had failed. Also on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia was preparing to bomb the Black Sea port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine, adding that the airport in Vynnytsia, in the west of the country, had been destroyed by a rocket strike. Russia has fired a total of 600 missiles since the invasion of Ukraine began, a senior US defense official told CNN on Sunday, and has committed approximately 95% of its amassed combat power inside Ukraine. CNN has not independently confirmed these figures. Putin dials up threats against West -- as protests mount in Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday issued a series of threats against Ukraine and Western powers, in his first expansive remarks since the invasion began. ""The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they put under question the future of Ukrainian statehood,"" Putin said during a meeting with Russian flight crew members at an Aeroflot training center in Moscow. ""And if that happens, it will be entirely on their conscience."" Putin also said Western sanctions were the ""equivalent of a declaration of war,"" and warned he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine as ""participants in a military conflict."" Zelensky has repeatedly called on the US and NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but the US and NATO said this was not an option currently being considered. Meanwhile, anti-war rallies that have sprung up across Russia led to at least 4,640 people being detained on Sunday in connection with the protests, according to an independent human rights monitoring group tracking detentions. The OVD-Info group said arrests had been made in 147 cities, and since the invasion began more than 13,000 people had been arrested in Russia over the demonstrations. Harrowing insights into what Russian occupation looks like The southern port city of Kherson was seized by Russian forces last week after days of heavy bombardment and shelling. The Ukrainian flag was still hoisted on government buildings, and the mayor of the city, Ihor Kolykhaiev, remained in his post. Kolykhaiev said Saturday that Russian troops were everywhere and that the city of nearly 300,000 people was without power and water and in desperate need of humanitarian aid. Speaking to CNN, residents of Kherson under Russian occupation describe days of terror confined to their apartments and houses, fearful to go outside for even basic necessities. Russian troops are shooting at anyone who attempts to leave, according to the residents. Grocery stores have been emptied and medicine is running out, residents and officials said. On Saturday, several hundred people gathered in the city's center, with one video of the demonstrations showing people walking into Kherson's main square despite volleys of gunfire. On Sunday, further demonstrations occurred in smaller numbers. West moves to counter Russia The multinational effort to get weapons into Ukraine has seen an undisclosed airfield near the Ukrainian border become a hub for shipping weapons, a senior Defense Department official said Sunday. The airport's location remains a secret to protect the shipments of weapons, including anti-armor missiles, into Ukraine. The Russian military has not targeted these shipments once they enter Ukraine, the official said, but there is some concern Russia could begin targeting the deliveries as its assault advances. US European Command (EUCOM) is at the heart of the massive shipment operation, using its liaison network with allies and partners to coordinate ""in real time"" to send materials into Ukraine, a second Defense official said. Meanwhile, an interview with CNN on Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration was ""now talking to our European partners and allies to look in a coordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil."" He also said Sunday that the US has seen reports of Russian abuses in Ukraine that ""would constitute a war crime"" and that the Biden administration is committed to supporting investigations into the country's actions",47,1.4558194367235262,4.197751920992475,-2.741932484268949,24

Ukrainian officials rejected the Kremlin's unilateral proposal for evacuation corridors for civilians as an unacceptable non-starter. Most of the routes lead to Russia or its staunch ally Belarus and would require people to travel through active areas of fighting. A spokesman for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Moscow's offer ""completely immoral"" and said Russia was trying to ""use people's suffering to create a television picture,"" Reuters reported. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk responded to Russia's announcement by demanding that Moscow ""accept options for our routes, as well as ... establish a ceasefire, which we will agree on."" Ukraine has requested that evacuation corridors are opened that largely keep citizens inside Ukraine's borders. The United Nations also led a chorus of international condemnation towards Russia's proposal on Monday. ""It's important that people be able to go where they choose and where it's safe,"" UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric told reporters, rejecting the Kremlin's proposal. Regardless, skepticism toward such corridors was growing after evacuations of civilians were paused within hours on both Saturday and Sunday when Russian forces were accused of shelling the escape routes. There were two failed attempts over the weekend to open a corridor from the besieged port of Mariupol. And on Sunday, a Russian military strike killed a family with two children as well as several other civilians trying to flee the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, according to the mayor. Ukrainian authorities said two mortar or artillery shells hit a checkpoint in Irpin, northwest of the capital, which has been the site of intense shelling by the Russian military in recent days. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said America has seen ""very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians"" in Ukraine that would be considered a war crime. In remarks to the UN Security Council Monday, Ukraine Ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya said that it was ""appalling"" that Russian troops were opening fire on evacuees after both countries had allocated certain roads to be utilized as evacuation corridors. The argument over evacuation corridors comes as Russia steps up efforts in its assault on Ukraine. Attacks on the capital, Kyiv, have intensified, while citizens in Mariupol and other key cities have been without water and food for days, unable to flee. Dominik Stillhart, the International Committee of the Red Cross's director of operations, said Monday that problems remained in confirming the details of any ceasefire agreement. Stillhart told BBC Radio 4's Today program the challenge was to get Russia and Ukraine into an agreement that is ""concrete, actionable and precise."" He added that so far there had only been agreements ""in principle,"" which had immediately broken down because they lacked precision, regarding routes and who can use them. Illustrating his point, he said some ICRC staff had tried to get out of Mariupol along an agreed route on Sunday, but soon realized ""the road indicated to them was actually mined."" Russia proposed a new ceasefire starting 10 a.m. Moscow time (2 a.m. ET Tuesday) that indicates it's ready to open evacuation corridors from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol, Russian media reported, quoting the Russian Coordination Headquarters for Humanitarian Response in Ukraine. On Monday afternoon, Ukraine had yet to formally agree to the ceasefire proposal. Earlier Monday, Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the civilian corridors leading directly to Russia were part of a personal request from French President Emmanuel Macron to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. But the Élysée Palace responded with a statement saying this was false. It added that the ""personal demand of the President of the (French) Republic, like the rest of the allies and partners, is that the Russian offensive ends."" Ukrainian deputy prime minister Vereshchuk criticized the Kremlin for its claim. ""We urge the Russian Federation to stop manipulating and abusing the trust of world leaders such as Emmanuel Macron, such as the leaders of China, Turkey or India, and to make the routes we have identified open,"" Vereshchuk said in a video statement released by the government. Martin Griffiths, the UN's Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, urged ""safe passage for civilians to leave areas of active hostilities on a voluntary basis, in the direction they choose"" on Monday. He also requested the need for ""safe passage for humanitarian supplies into areas of active hostilities,"" in a speech to the UN Security Council. ""Civilians in places like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Melitopol, and elsewhere desperately need aid, especially life-saving medical supplies. Many modalities are possible, but it must take place in line with the parties' obligations under the laws of war,"" he said.",47,2.1072351324428933,4.12361573387334,-2.0163806014304466,24
2022-03-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/investing/cybersecurity-stocks-russia-ukraine/index.html,A rare bright spot in the stock market may be set to fizzle out,"Tech stocks, like the rest of the broader market, have seen their fair share of ups and downs since Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the end of February. But for one part of the technology sector — cybersecurity -— it's been a roaring bull market for the past few weeks. The ETFMG Prime Cyber Security and First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity exchange-traded funds, which both own shares of top cybersecurity companies such as Zscaler, CrowdStrike, Cloudflare, Fortinet and Splunk, have each surged about 10% since Russia attacked Ukraine. The rally makes sense. After all, there are growing concerns about cyber warfare from Russia against the West in response to sanctions against Vladimir Putin's regime. ""The evolution of cyberthreat activity could shape the very nature of conflict in the future,"" said S&P Global Market Intelligence in a recent report. ""Russian cyberattacks could strike US infrastructure in the wake of the Ukraine conflict, according to national security experts."" But have the stocks run up too far too fast? Both cyber ETFs are still down more than 7% this year, despite their recent surges. Some of the individual stocks in the funds have suffered even bigger drops. Fortinet and CrowdStrike have both fallen more than 15% this year, for example. Many investors remain nervous that the broader slowdown in the tech sector could be a sign of weaker demand for cybersecurity services, despite the growing risk of data breaches. There are also some questions about whether smaller cybersecurity firms will be able to compete with tech juggernauts like Microsoft and Cisco, both of which have invested lots of money to bolster their own tech security businesses. Still, the presence of larger tech companies in cybersecurity might also be a blessing for the smaller players. ""We are absolutely seeing more interest in cybersecurity,"" said Sam Masucci, founder and CEO of ETFMG about its ETF and the companies in the fund, which trades under the ticker symbol HACK. ""The fund is positioned well for any mergers and acquisitions."" Shares of Splunk, for example, briefly surged earlier this year on reports that Cisco might want to buy it. And Mandiant, the company formerly known as FireEye, was the subject of a rumor that Microsoft was looking to acquire it. Late Monday, The Information reported that Google owner Alphabet also might be interested in Mandiant. ""Cybersecurity will continue to be a key driver of mergers and acquisitions in 2022,"" said Sapana Maheria, practice head of thematic research at GlobalData, in a report last month following the chatter about Cisco and Spunk. She added that the security software market is ""ripe for deals."" That may be true. However, publicly traded cybersecurity companies might now be too rich for some buyers' blood. ""Valuations are high. There is a lot of cash chasing too few deals and a scarcity of assets. It's still frothy,"" said Steve Vintz, chief financial officer of Tenable, a cyber risk management company with a history of buying smaller, privately held companies. ""You have to be selective with mergers.""",20,6.113230809361179,6.175175657085398,-0.061944847724219265,2

Two mortar or artillery shells hit the checkpoint in the suburb of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities said, which has been the site of intense shelling by the Russian military in recent days. Irpin Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said eight civilians have been killed across the district, and international media filming at the checkpoint reported that a shell landed as a stream of civilians was coming through. ""A family died,"" Markushyn said in a statement. ""In front of my eyes, two small children and two adults died."" Video from the moment the strike killed a family shows a Ukrainian soldier standing outside a building on a street. Suddenly, an explosion is seen and heard on the video. Debris is heard raining down on the building and the street is obscured by a dust cloud. A number of journalists are heard reacting to the strike. As the scene begins clearing, someone is seen pulling the Ukrainian soldier away. Other soldiers run across the street and appear to be checking the condition of a number of individuals on the ground. ""Medic,"" someone is heard repeatedly screaming. Photographs from the Associated Press showed bodies on the ground covered by sheets, with suitcases standing upright nearby. CNN has determined the civilians were killed in the Russian military strike seen in the video. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration appealed to international organizations for help in resolving a growing humanitarian crisis. ""Thousands of people found themselves in isolation, because of direct hostilities, and in some places for 5-6 days they survive without electricity, water, food, medical help and means of subsistence. They are in direct danger,"" it said. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Sunday that more than 360 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began, while acknowledging that the real figure is likely ""considerably higher."" CNN cannot independently verify the casualty numbers. The UN also reports more than 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24. Evacuation corridors closed In the country's southeast, hopes that a second attempt to open up safe evacuation routes for civilians in Mariupol and Volnovakha might succeed -- after a first effort failed on Saturday -- were dashed within hours. The governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Facebook on Sunday that the planned ""evacuation convoy with local residents was never able to leave Mariupol today: the Russians began to regroup their forces and heavy shelling of the city. It is extremely dangerous to evacuate people in such conditions."" Kyrylenko added that a convoy carrying humanitarian aid from the central city of Zaporizhzhia, three hours from Mariupol, ""has not yet reached its destination and is currently on its way."" The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also said Sunday's planned evacuation in Mariupol had failed. ""Today, our team began opening up the evacuation route from Mariupol before hostilities resumed. We remain in Mariupol and are ready to help facilitate further attempts -- if the parties reach an agreement, which is for them alone to implement and respect,"" the ICRC said on Twitter. ""People in Mariupol and in other places across #Ukraine are living in desperate situations. They must be protected at all times. They are not a target. People urgently need water, food, shelter. The basics of life. We need safety guarantees to be able to bring them aid."" Ukrainian lawmaker Inna Sovsun claimed Sunday that Russian forces had damaged a gas pipeline in southeastern Ukraine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without heat in bitter temperatures. ""Donetsk-Mariupol gas pipeline was damaged by #Russian occupants. Now, more than 750,000 of people are left without any heat, while it's still often below 0°C (32 degrees Fahrenheit) outside,"" Sovsun said on Twitter. Separately, television and radio broadcasts have been knocked out in Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, after Russian military strikes, according to the Regional Administration. In a post on Facebook Sunday, the Regional Administration said ""repeated shelling"" of the TV tower in Kharkiv had knocked out broadcasting capabilities. Russia has fired a total of 600 missiles since the invasion of Ukraine began, a senior US defense official told CNN on Sunday, and has committed approximately 95% of its amassed combat power inside Ukraine. Earlier Sunday, heavy shelling was reported to the west and northwest of Kyiv. The impact of explosions was heard by CNN teams in Kyiv and in rural areas to the southwest. ""They (Russian troops) captured Hostomel and Bucha yesterday (Saturday). The Russians entered there,"" said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in the Ukrainian President's Office, referring to two suburbs northwest of Kyiv. ""They have injured many children and do not allow to evacuate them, despite numerous appeals at the highest state level to provide a 'green corridor' from Bucha and Irpin. There are many children in the basements."" Arestovych described the situation as a ""catastrophe,"" adding that discussions were going on ""at the highest level with international humanitarian institutions, through mediators with the Russians"" in order to find a way out for those who are trapped. Several children have died, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Health. Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Sunday that Russia was preparing to bomb the Black Sea port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine and said the airport in Vynnytsia, in the west of the country, had been destroyed by a rocket strike. In an address broadcast on Facebook, Zelensky said: ""Russian people always used to come to Odessa and they only knew warmth and generosity and what's now? Artillery, bombs against Odessa. This will be a war crime. This will be (a) historic crime."" In a separate message, Zelensky again appealed for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine, following the destruction of Vynnytsia's airport. ""They continue to ruin our infrastructure our life, which we have built, and our parents, and grandparents, many generations of Ukrainians. We repeat every day -- close the skies over Ukraine,"" he added. US and European officials have been discussing how the West would support a government in exile helmed by Zelensky should he have to flee Kyiv, Western officials told CNN. The discussions have ranged from supporting Zelensky and top Ukrainian officials in a potential move to Lviv in western Ukraine, to the possibility that Zelensky and his aides are forced to flee Ukraine altogether and establish a new government in Poland, the officials said. Western officials have been wary of discussing a government in exile directly with Zelensky because he wants to stay in Kyiv and has so far rejected conversations that focus on anything other than boosting Ukraine in its fight against Russia, two Western diplomats said. Calls for more support As the Russian invasion continues, Zelensky has reiterated his pleas for US and NATO assistance in establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine -- a move which could prevent Russian forces from carrying out airstrikes against the country. But there are fears such a move could be seen as an escalation, with Russian President Vladimir Putin warning on Saturday he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine as ""participants in a military conflict."" Zelensky has repeatedly asked NATO and Western officials to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but both say they oppose such a move. In an impassioned call to US lawmakers Saturday, Zelensky also encouraged Eastern European nations to provide Ukraine with fighter jets, stressing they were needed to defend against Russian aggression. On the call, Zelensky said if the West won't impose a no-fly zone they should give Ukraine planes. A White House spokesperson confirmed the United States is working with Poland on the possibility of Warsaw providing fighter jets to Ukraine. Some Biden administration officials privately fear that this move could be viewed by the Russians as an escalation, US officials say. Meanwhile, a multinational effort to send weapons to Ukraine is running at top speed at an undisclosed airfield in Eastern Europe, a defense official said. The US European Command is at the heart of the operation, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley met last week with troops and personnel to examine the weapons shipments activity, the official said. Since the invasion, 14 countries have sent security assistance to Ukraine, a senior US defense official said Friday, some of which had rarely sent such substantial equipment before. Putin claimed Saturday that Russia had almost completed the destruction of Ukrainian air defense systems, and added that Western sanctions were the ""equivalent of a declaration of war."" Speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US has seen ""very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians"" in Ukraine that would be considered a war crime. He added that the US is working with its allies in Europe to look into the possibility of banning Russian oil imports in an effort to further punish the country for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.",47,4.227341190154053,2.171062221072832,2.0562789690812213,24

Mark Milley went last week to an undisclosed airfield near the Ukrainian border that has become a hub for shipping weapons, a senior Defense Department official said, seeing firsthand the multinational effort to get weapons into Ukraine amid Russia's unprovoked invasion. While at the airfield, Milley met with troops and personnel and examined the shipment activity, the official said Friday. The site has become a beehive of activity in recent days, going from a handful of flights each day to as many as 17, the field's maximum capacity. The airport's location remains a secret to protect the shipments of weapons, including anti-armor missiles, into Ukraine. The Russian military has not targeted these shipments once they enter Ukraine, the official said, but there is some concern Russia could begin targeting the deliveries as its assault advances. The US and other NATO members have so far sent Ukraine 17,000 anti-tank missiles and 2,000 stinger anti-aircraft missiles, a senior US official told CNN. Since even before Russia's invasion began late last month, the skies above Europe have been filled with military cargo aircraft of the US and others, particularly C-17s, the backbone of the US airlift fleet. The flights have been repositioning troops along NATO's eastern flank, but also moving weapons to the transfer points where they can be delivered to Ukraine. The pace of the flights has only increased. US European Command (EUCOM) is at the heart of the massive shipment operation, using its liaison network with allies and partners to coordinate ""in real time"" to send materials into Ukraine, a second Defense official said. EUCOM is also coordinating with other countries, including the United Kingdom, in terms of the delivery process ""to ensure that we are using our resources to maximum efficiency to support the Ukrainians in an organized way,"" the official added. Since Russia's invasion began, 14 countries have sent security assistance to Ukraine, the official said, some of whom had rarely sent such substantial equipment before. The ""vast majority"" of a $350 million US security assistance package has already been delivered to Ukraine, according to the official, only one week after it was officially approved by the White House. Approximately $240 million of the package has reached Ukraine, and the rest should arrive within days and maybe weeks, ""but not longer,"" the official said Friday. The components that have already been delivered include ""the most needed capabilities, like anti-armor capabilities."" Once in possession of the weapons, the Ukrainians have used them to slow and stall Russian assaults in different parts of Ukraine. ""I think all of us have been tremendously impressed by how effectively the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been using the equipment that we've provided them,"" the official said. Perhaps most notably, a massive Russian convoy spanning 40 miles of road north of Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, has barely moved in days. ""We know that they have conducted attacks on that convoy, that those attacks were effective in slowing and stopping it,"" another senior Defense official said Friday. The equipment being sent in is equipment on which the Ukrainians have already received training, including some ""just-in-time"" training in late December and early January, the senior official said, adding that the Ukrainians can ""use proficiently"" the vast majority of the military equipment being sent in. The speed at which the US now delivers weapons to Ukraine is dramatically faster than just two months ago. Most of a $200 million package approved in late December was delivered within a month, though some ammunition has yet to be shipped, the official said. Meanwhile, the complete $350 million package, which the official described as the largest presidential drawdown in history, should be completed within days or weeks.

Ukrainian authorities said thousands of civilians remained trapped in the southeastern cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha and accused Russian forces of breaching an agreement to pause fire to allow safe passage out. Putin, meanwhile, used a meeting with Russian flight crew members at an Aeroflot training center in Moscow, to make his first expansive remarks since the invasion nine days ago. ""The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they put under question the future of Ukrainian statehood,"" Putin said. ""And if that happens, it will be entirely on their conscience."" Putin also said Western sanctions were the ""equivalent of a declaration of war,"" and warned he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine as ""participants in a military conflict."" President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly pleaded with NATO and Western officials to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a move which could prevent Russian forces from carrying out airstrikes against their country. But NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday that a no-fly zone is not an option being considered by the alliance. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that establishing such a zone could lead to a ""full-fledged war in Europe,"" but added Washington would continue to work with its allies to provide Ukrainians with the means to defend themselves from Russian aggression. Late Saturday, a White House spokesperson confirmed to CNN that the US is working with Poland on the possibility of Poland providing fighter jets to Ukraine, as President Zelensky is pushing for eastern European countries to send fighter aircraft into his country. As part of the conversations with Poland, the US is determining what ""capabilities we could provide to backfill Poland if it decided to transfer planes to Ukraine,"" said the spokesperson, who would not detail what backfill options are under consideration. The spokesperson said sending fighter jets into Ukraine is a ""sovereign decision for any country to make"" and noted there are a host of logistics to work through, including how the aircraft would be transferred from Poland to Ukraine. Two lawmakers participating in a zoom call with the Ukrainian president earlier Saturday said Zelensky said Poland has signaled its prepared to send MiG fighter jets but that ""they are only waiting for you [the US] to allow it."" Stalled evacuation effort The Russian Ministry of Defense said earlier Saturday it would stop bombarding Mariupol and Volnovakha, which have endured days of heavy, indiscriminate shelling. Residents there have hunkered down in basements without power and with limited supplies of food and water, volunteers gathering information from the ground told CNN. But just a few hours after the announcement to pause fire, a top regional official accused Russia of breaking its agreement. ""Due to the fact that the Russians are not observing the ceasefire regime and continue shelling Mariupol and its outskirts, the evacuation of the population has been postponed for security reasons,"" governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, announced on Twitter. Iryna Vereshchuk, the Ukrainian minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, said Saturday that about 200,000 people were to be evacuated from Mariupol and a further 15,000 from Volnovakha. Kyrylenko said 400 people were evacuated from Volnovakha and surrounding villages on Saturday, adding that while the authorities ""intended to evacuate a much larger number of people, the convoy had to stop moving as the Russians resumed the ruthless shelling of Volnovakha and it was extremely dangerous to move there."" Meanwhile, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said in a statement that just as the city was ready to begin evacuations of its residents to Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro, Russian forces ""began shelling along the corridor, where we were supposed to go."" ""This morning we received a confirmation from the Russian Federation, from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, that the corridor from Mariupol to the cities of Zaporizhzhia and the Dnipro is safe. We received a guarantee of ceasefire regime ... there is no ceasefire regime now,"" he said. ""This does not give us a sense of security for going to Zaporizhzhia."" Later Saturday, in a interview on a YouTube channel, Boichenko painted a grim picture of life in the city. Boichenko said the city, with a population of nearly 400,000, had been without power for five days. He said there were no mobile networks, and ""since the attack on Mariupol, we lost our reserve water supply, and so we are totally without water now."" He said the ""wounded and dead over these past five days number in the dozens. By the eighth day there were hundreds. Now we are already talking about thousands."" He added: ""These figures are only going to get worse. But this is the sixth straight day of airstrikes and we are not able to get out to recover the dead."" Later on Saturday, in a statement carried by Russian news agency TASS, General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said that ""not a single civilian was able to leave Mariupol and Volnovakha along the announced security corridors,"" that Russian forces had resumed their offensive, and blamed ""the Ukrainian side."" At the same time, Ukrainians -- including children, and elderly men and women -- managed to escape Kyiv on Saturday by crossing a damaged bridge on the northwestern outskirts of the capital. The bridge, connecting the suburb of Irpin to central Kyiv, was blown up by Ukrainian forces to prevent Russian forces from using it to enter the city. As a result, civilians fleeing a week of heavy bombardment were forced to scramble over heaped rubble and twisted metal to make their way to the other side. Some appeared exhausted and visibly distressed, struggling to balance as they hauled their bags up the steep slope. 'There are corpses lying around' CNN received a written account from a resident of a village near Volnovakha, whose husband has been trying to evacuate people from the city in recent days. ""The situation in the city is very scary,"" Marina Gasanova wrote. ""There is almost nothing left in the city, something comes in every minute from all sides, it is not clear what ... and it is not clear from where it comes. Scary, crazy!"" she wrote. ""Every minute, every second, everyone is shooting. From all sides. It's just impossible! There are corpses lying around, torn-off arms, torn-off legs."" Vereshchuk said that according to reports from her country's military, Russian forces were using the pause in fire to continue their advance. She stressed that the corridors were being used to evacuate civilians, including women and children, and to deliver aid, like medicine and food. ""The whole world is watching this. I sincerely hope that such a first step, which I hope will end positively and people will get shelter, but not sit for weeks under the rubble, in basements without water, without communication and without food, will continue,"" she said. Earlier on Saturday, Zelensky pleaded for the evacuation corridors to work to save people, but he also said that those ""who can defend their city must continue to fight."" Doctors Without Borders (MSF) issued a statement on Saturday pleading for the evacuation corridors to remain open. The statement included an account from a MSF staff member in Mariupol, who said the situation in the city was getting desperate. ""We collected snow and rain water yesterday to have some utility water. We tried to get free water today but the queue was huge ... multiple grocery stores were destroyed by missiles and the remaining things were taken by people in desperate need,"" it read. ""Still no power, water, heating and mobile connection. No one heard about any evacuation yet. Pharmacies are out of medicine.""",47,2.483018207273502,1.8066921165720375,0.6763260907014643,24

The US has already seen ""some indications"" that Russian mercenaries may be involved in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine ""in some places,"" a senior defense official said earlier this week, but it wasn't clear exactly where or in what numbers. ""We've seen some indications that they're being employed,"" the official said. Now a US official tells CNN that Russia is planning to deploy up to 1,000 more mercenaries in the near future. Some Russian forces have struggled with morale issues and setbacks on the battlefield, including a massive convoy north of Kyiv that has remained largely stalled for the past several days. The mercenary forces would fortify the flagging units, the official said, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its second weekend. The official added that the US believes the mercenaries already in Ukraine have ""performed poorly when facing the stiffer-than-expected resistance from the Ukrainians,"" and that as many as 200 such mercenaries have already been killed in the war as of late February. Meanwhile, US and western officials expect Russia to increase the pace and strength of its strikes on key Ukrainian population centers, including the capital of Kyiv, from which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has broadcast steady but defiant messages against Russia's aggression. Russia now seems prepared to ""bombard cities into submission,"" one senior western intelligence official said on Friday, which could include a significant increase in the number of civilian casualties. ""It's a very crude approach,"" the official said. ""The heavier weapons are not just heavier in the weight, they're also heavier in terms of the damage that they can inflict. And they're far less discriminant."" Other officials have noticed a shift in Russian strategy from military targets to civilians, with more attacks becoming focused on population centers. The new approach comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to get the quick victory he wanted, and the Russian military has faced a stiff and determined Ukrainian resistance across the country. In the face of the resistance, the attacks will increase, officials warned. ""The days to come are likely to be worse, with more death, more suffering, and more destruction, as the Russian armed forces bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the sentiment during a news conference in Brussels Friday where he is meeting with European allies.

2022-03-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/05/europe/ukraine-kherson-russian-occupation-cmd-intl/index.html,'They shoot at anyone who tries to leave.' Ukrainians describe terror of living under Russian occupation,"A volley of machine-gun fire erupted just as Andriy Abba's family raised a toast to celebrate his 30th birthday in Kherson. Wine glass in hand, he rushed with his parents and younger brother to the basement. Outside, Russian troops were in the final throes of occupying their city -- the first to fall to Moscow since its bloody invasion began a week ago. As the day wore on, Abba said, the rattling of bullets and thuds of explosion began to fade. At around midnight, silence descended on the city. ""And that's when we knew,"" Abba told CNN. ""It was very sad."" Kherson, a key port city on the Black Sea, in southern Ukraine, was overrun by Russian forces in the early hours of Wednesday, after days of heavy bombardment and shelling. The Ukrainian flag was still hoisted on government buildings, and the mayor of the city, Ihor Kolykhaiev, remained in his post. On Saturday, Kolykhaiev announced that Russian troops were everywhere, and the city of nearly 300,000 people was without power and water, and in desperate need of humanitarian aid. Kolykhaiev said that the Russian forces had ""settled in"" to the city, and showed no signs of leaving. ""We have a lot of people here in need. We have cancer patients. Children who need medication. This medication is not currently getting through to them,"" he told CNN, adding that the Russians wanted to send aid, but residents were refusing it. People living in Kherson under Russian occupation describe days of terror confined to their apartments and houses, fearful to go outside for even basic necessities -- their city now a dystopian shell of the home they knew and loved. Checkpoints manned by Russian troops pepper the city's streets, five Kherson residents told CNN in recent phone calls. The roads are virtually empty because inhabitants have either fled the fighting, or are staying indoors for fear of encountering Russian soldiers. Grocery stores have been emptied and medicine is running out, residents and officials said. Russian troops have encircled the city and are shooting at anyone who attempts to leave, according to the residents, including a top local health official who CNN is not naming for security reasons. On Thursday, Russian forces shot two men at a checkpoint after they attempted to pass, killing one and seriously wounding the other, the official told CNN. Russian troops have also prohibited ambulances from leaving the city's perimeters to reach villages in the province, according to the official. A woman going through a long and dangerous labor in the outskirts of the city had to resort to a panicked video consultation with her doctor because Russian forces had blocked a medical team trying to assist with the birth, the official said. ""After about a day of the local authorities begging the Russians, the mother and the child were allowed to pass to the hospital,"" said the official. ""It was horrible."" Andriy Abba, who works as a tax lawyer, says he is determined to stay in Kherson regardless of the occupation, for as long as the Ukrainian flag remains flying on government buildings. ""Even if we wanted to evacuate women and children from here, it's just plain impossible,"" he added. ""They shoot at anyone who tries to leave."" Ukrainian authorities have been working to establish the safe exit of civilians from besieged areas in ongoing negotiations with Moscow. Russia agreed to hold fire Saturday from 9 a.m. Kyiv time, and create humanitarian corridors allowing residents to escape the southern cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha -- the first tangible sign of cooperation. But the agreement quickly fell apart, stalling evacuations, Ukrainian officials said. The government accused Russian forces of shelling the cities, and even targeting the evacuation corridors out of them. ""Surrounded cities that are being destroyed"" are ""experiencing the worst days,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement on Saturday. ""Humanitarian corridors must work today. Mariupol and Volnovakha. To save people. Women, children, the elderly. To give food and medicine to those who remain."" Yulia Alekseeva, a mother of a two-month-old, said she is struggling to find diapers and other baby products. ""There are catastrophically few in the city. We also have a grandmother with dementia who needs diapers and medicines on an ongoing basis, which are also not available,"" she told CNN. Like most of the city's residents, Alekseeva has hunkered down with her family, leaving her house only to search for basic necessities. ""We are in hiding. There is a curfew in the city, if people go out after eight in the evening, they shoot to kill. You can move in the company of no more than two people,"" she said. But she remains defiant, adding: ""The Ukrainian flag is still over Kherson, the city did not surrender to the invaders. The military said not to provoke them and everyone would be alive."" On Saturday, a large crowd of protesters took to the occupied streets of Kherson, waving Ukrainian flags and coming face-to-face with Russian forces. The troops appeared to fire live bullets in the air to disperse the crowds, social media video showed. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba shared footage of the scenes on Twitter, praising the demonstrators. ""Courageous Kherson inspires Ukraine and the world! Thousands of peaceful Ukrainians protests Russian occupation in front of armed Russian soldiers. What a spirit,"" he wrote Saturday. From her apartment in Kherson where she cares for her grandmother, Svetlana Zorina told CNN she would stay in the city ""for as long as the Ukrainian flag stands and the mayor is Ukrainian."" On Friday, she went to the grocery store only to find empty shelves, and then headed to the apartment of her mother, who is abroad, where she collected pasta and rice. ""We are, here, very afraid that we will become part of Russia. We don't want history to repeat like with Crimea,"" she said, referring to Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014. ""We're less afraid to be under bombs than to become a part of Russia."" It's something Abba is convinced won't happen in his city. Though he is consumed with fears of Russian annexation, he argued that in contrast to Crimea, which fell relatively bloodlessly, Kherson has put up a stiff resistance to occupation. ""The Russians have crossed a line multiple times,"" he said. ""There cannot be [another] Crimea.""",47,1.8235223179457694,5.474122184926044,-3.6505998669802744,24
2022-03-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/politics/putin-war-crimes-russia-ukraine-us-what-matters/index.html,Here's how war crimes prosecutions work,"Shocking atrocities in Ukraine, allegedly at the hands of Russian forces, have amplified calls to pursue war crimes charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Images of at least 20 bodies strewn across the street in Bucha, Ukraine, emerged in early April following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to call for an end to Russian ""war crimes."" And at least 50 deaths from a Russian missile strike on a railway station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk -- where civilians were waiting for evacuation trains to safer regions of the country -- led Zelensky to say, ""We expect a firm, global response to this war crime."" Already, there was a loud and growing chorus of calls for the International Criminal Court to pursue Putin for the unprovoked invasion, and the US government in March formally declared that members of the Russian armed forces have committed war crimes. The top war crimes prosecutor for the ICC has traveled to Ukraine to investigate, and the US Embassy in Kyiv argued in the war's opening days that specific Russian attacks constituted war crimes. ""It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant,"" the embassy said on its official Twitter feed on March 4. ""Putin's shelling of Europe's largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further."" Russia's bombing of hospitals and a theater where children were seeking refuge along with its suspected use of cluster bombs and so-called vacuum bombs in dense areas with many civilians have also been described as war crimes. ""The law is clear on this, it is a crime to intentionally target civilians, it is a crime to intentionally target civilian objects,"" Karim Khan, the ICC's chief prosecutor, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. But Khan added there is a burden of proof and a process that must play out. Here's a very broad look at war crimes and the international justice movement. Note: Some of what's below comes from CNN's research library, which compiled information about the International Criminal Court. What is a war crime? The International Criminal Court has specific definitions for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. Read about them in this guide published by the ICC. Specifically, targeting civilian populations, violating the Geneva Conventions, targeting specific groups of people and more could be potential Russian war crimes. Khan said there can be justified attacks in civilian areas if they are being used to launch attacks. But even then, he said, attacks in civilian areas cannot be disproportionate. There is a method of gathering evidence from testimony, satellite images and elsewhere to meet a burden of proof. What is the International Criminal Court? Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute first brought before the United Nations, the International Criminal Court operates independently. Most countries on Earth -- 123 of them -- are parties to the treaty, but there are very large and notable exceptions, including Russia and the US. And, for that matter, Ukraine. Who can be tried by the court? Anyone accused of a crime in the jurisdiction of the court, which includes countries that are members of the ICC, can be tried. The court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea. However, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia. That seems unlikely. What crimes does the court handle? The ICC is meant to be a court of ""last resort"" and is not meant to replace a country's justice system. The court, which has 18 judges serving nine-year terms, tries four types of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes. How does the ICC bring proceedings? Court proceedings can be brought in one of two ways: Either a national government or the UN Security Council can refer cases for investigation. Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has veto power over council actions. It was requests by 39 national governments, most of them European, that sparked this current investigation. Khan previously told CNN, ""I want to emphasize that I'm willing to speak to all sides, and not just the Ukrainian side, but also the Russian Federation, state parties and non-state parties alike. This institution is not political. We're not part of the geostrategic or geopolitical divisions that we witness around the world."" What will the ICC investigate in relation to Ukraine? In its new investigation into Russia's possible war crimes, the ICC has said it will look at all actions in Ukraine from 2013 to the present. Russia first entered Crimea, which has been part of Ukraine, in 2014. The ICC was already investigating crackdowns on protesters by a previous Ukrainian government that was pro-Russian. This new referral seems to put all potential war crimes together. How long do these investigations take? If justice in general moves slowly, international justice barely moves at all. Investigations at the ICC take many years. Only a handful of convictions have ever been won. A preliminary investigation into the hostilities in eastern Ukraine lasted more than six years -- from April 2014 until December 2020. At the time, the prosecutor said there was evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Next steps were slowed by the Covid-19 pandemic and a lack of resources at the court, which is conducting multiple investigations. That perception of slow and ineffective justice will test the system of international law, Khan told Cooper. ""This is a test for the court. It's a test for me, it's a test for the office,"" he said. What are cluster bombs and vacuum bombs? In addition to attacks on hospitals and civilian apartment buildings, the feared use of banned weapons meant to kill without discrimination is another very specific war crime. With a cluster bomb, a missile is fired and explodes thousands of feet in the air, releasing smaller bombs that each detonate when they fall to the ground. See an illustration from The Washington Post. Amnesty International said a Russian cluster bomb fell on a Ukrainian preschool. ""Vacuum bombs,"" or thermobaric weapons, suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects. Russia previously used them in Chechnya. 'This is genocide' Now, Russia is facing more accusations of war crimes after its forces began retreating from areas near Kyiv, including Bucha, following a failed bid to encircle the capital. Asked during an appearance on CBS in early April if Russia was carrying out genocide in his country based on the images out of Bucha, Zelensky said: ""Indeed. This is genocide."" The alleged atrocities in Bucha have drawn outrage from leaders outside of Ukraine, with Western leaders, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, calling for war crimes investigations and increasing sanctions on Russia. ""Since the aggression, we've come out and said that we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes, and we've been working to document that, to provide the information we have to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together. And there needs to be accountability for it,"" he told CNN. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the deaths. Why would a Ukraine prosecution be different? The international outcry against Russia is unique, and that could give the court the ability to operate differently, according to Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University and co-editor-in-chief of Just Security, an online forum. ""It's hard to judge the ICC's investigation based on past practice,"" Goodman said in an email after the court initially launched its investigation. ""In the Ukraine situation, the prosecutor is buttressed by an extraordinary outpouring of support from dozens of countries, which I expect will be followed by an infusion of resources."" How would an ICC case affect the conflict? ""For better or for worse, the ICC investigation may affect the diplomatic space for negotiations,"" said Goodman, arguing Putin and other Russians might not want to risk arrest if they travel outside the country. The investigation could also, he argued, weaken Putin at home. ""Russians may come to realize this is another reason Putin can no longer serve their country,"" Goodman said. What happened before the ICC? Previous trials for war crimes were brought by special UN tribunals, such as those empaneled for the former Yugoslavia, focusing on the Serbian autocrat Slobodan Milosevic, and for the Rwandan genocide. All of this stems from the precedent of the Nuremberg trials to bring Nazis to justice after World War II and held by the Allies, including the US, the Soviet Union, France and Germany. So it is interesting that neither the US nor Russia are members of the ICC. Why aren't the US and Russia ICC members? Both the US and Russia are signatories to the treaty that created the court -- meaning their leaders signed it -- but neither is a member of the court. Russia pulled out of the court in 2016 days after an ICC report published what CNN called a ""damning verdict"" on Russia's occupation of Crimea in 2014. The court also launched a probe in 2016 into Russia's 2008 efforts to support breakaway regions in Georgia. At the time, France had also accused Russia of committing war crimes in Syria. As for the US, while President Bill Clinton signed the treaty creating the court in 2000, he never recommended the Senate ratify it. The George W. Bush administration, to a fair amount of criticism, pulled the US from being a party to the treaty in 2002. The Pentagon and many US policymakers have long opposed joining such an international court system since it could open US servicemembers to allegations of war crimes. ""The president (George W. Bush) thinks the ICC is fundamentally flawed because it puts American servicemen and women at fundamental risk of being tried by an entity that is beyond America's reach, beyond America's laws and can subject American civilians and military to arbitrary standards of justice,"" then-White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said at the time. How has the US supported the court? Opposing America joining the court did not mean the Bush administration opposed the court itself. It supported ICC efforts to seek justice for genocide in Sudan. There has always been an awkwardness to how American presidents deal with the court, noted CNN's Tim Lister in 2011. He wrote about Barac",45,5.76800010389908,4.910373457266834,0.8576266466322462,3
2022-03-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/politics/us-ukraine-intelligence/index.html,US officials say Biden administration is sharing intelligence with Ukraine at a 'frenetic' pace after Republicans criticize efforts,"The US has multiple channels open and is sharing intelligence with Ukraine at a ""frenetic"" pace, US officials said Thursday, disputing criticism that the Biden administration is not sharing battlefield intelligence fast enough. Still, the US' secure communications with Ukrainian officials are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain as the war rages on, the sources told CNN. Officials also acknowledged that the US is now more limited in its ability to collect real-time intelligence with no one on the ground, and the apparent lack of military drones flying overhead. The CIA has not acknowledged whether it is flying its own drones to surveil the conflict. Republican Sens. Ben Sasse and Marco Rubio, the top GOP member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have both said publicly in recent days that they are concerned intelligence isn't getting to the Ukrainian military quickly enough. House Republicans began amplifying those concerns this week, ramping up criticism of the Biden administration for allegedly ""withholding"" intelligence from the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians, though, have not complained publicly about any lack of intelligence-sharing by the US. One Senate source familiar with GOP concerns said that lawmakers were concerned both that the intelligence was being downgraded, or made less specific, and that it wasn't being conveyed to the Ukrainians fast enough. Sources familiar with the intelligence said it is indeed being downgraded, but primarily to scrub sensitive sources and methods -- a particular concern given the logistical challenges with establishing fully secure lines with Ukrainian officials amid the Russian onslaught. In most cases, two sources familiar with the sharing system said, the intelligence being shared involves information about Russian force movements and locations, as well as intercepted communications about their military plans. And it is typically being provided to Ukrainian officials as quickly as within 30 minutes to an hour of the US receiving it, one of the sources said. The sharing has been facilitated via secure communications equipment, although all communication with forces on the ground in Kyiv is becoming increasingly difficult given ongoing power and communications disruptions in the besieged capital, another source said. A key workaround has been a portal that was set up in recent weeks where US officials can upload intelligence that the Ukrainians can then access in near real time, the first source said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that the US has shared ""a significant amount of detailed timely intelligence on Russia's plans and activities with the Ukrainian government to help Ukrainians defend themselves."" ""We've been doing that for months,"" Psaki said. ""This includes information that should help them inform and develop their military response to Russia's invasion, that's what's happening -- or has been happening."" Another source of concern among critics of the US' system appears to be that the administration is not providing the kind of detailed ""targeting intelligence"" that has long been used in lethal ""find, fix and finish"" operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan. There may be practical reasons why the US can't provide some of the more granular ""targeting intelligence"" that some lawmakers are demanding. Much of the intelligence community's ""imint"" -- an intelligence community term that means ""imagery intelligence"" -- comes from satellites. Two sources familiar with the intelligence said some of the ""game-changing"" intelligence on Russian military positions is coming from commercial imagery. But those satellites are often limited by weather in what they can see, and in any event, can't provide the kind of live-time video that lower-flying drones are capable of. Current and former officials also told CNN that the United States does not maintain the kind of 24/7 drone coverage in Ukraine that became typical of American conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Although the Pentagon has not commented on surveillance efforts in eastern Europe, flight tracking websites have repeatedly shown Global Hawk reconnaissance drones flying near, but not over, Ukrainian airspace. ""We are not providing the type of real-time targeting that you see our military having gotten in conflicts like in Iraq where instant to instant, we have UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles or drones), the unblinking eye as they say, watching the situation and giving that targeting data,"" Rep. Adam Smith, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Thursday. ""We're not doing that because that steps over the line to making us participate in the war."" US says it is sharing information for 'situational awareness' The Biden administration in recent weeks made a deliberate policy decision to describe any information being shared with Ukraine as an effort to help them gain ""situational awareness"" in the war, rather than explicitly to target and kill Russian soldiers, one of the sources said. The distinction is meant to avoid Russia being able to claim the US is becoming directly involved as a co-combatant in the war, which could risk direct conflict breaking out between Moscow and Washington. Sasse has also alleged that ""lawyers"" and unspecific ""technicalities"" are holding up the flow of information, a charge a senior defense official told reporters on Thursday was inaccurate. There are some indications that Biden administration guidelines for sharing intelligence with Ukraine have been amended as recently as this week. ""Generally speaking, I share concerns that some of that may not be getting there fast enough. And even today there has been work done to sort of assess that and make sure that any sort of unnecessary impediments are removed,"" Rubio told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday. The senior defense official told reporters Thursday that the US continues to ""provide information and intelligence to Ukraine as we assess would be most helpful."" Asked whether any decisions have been made that the US won't share certain targeting intelligence with Ukraine because it risks making the US a party to the conflict, the official declined to discuss the specifics of what is being shared. ""What I can tell you is we continue to provide intelligence and information to the Ukrainians, and that's ongoing,"" the official said. ""We share with them what we believe can be helpful to them. I'm not going to talk about the vehicles, I'm not going to talk about the parameters of that."" The official noted that the US no longer has boots on the ground in Ukraine or aircraft flying over the country's air space, saying the US ability to glean intelligence ""is not as robust as it once was."" ""The Ukrainians are on the ground, the Ukrainians are in the fight,"" the official said. ""And in many cases, in many ways they simply have more contextual information than what we can give them.""

2022-03-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-civilian-strikes-intl-cmd/index.html,Russia sends a message to all of Ukraine by hitting these civilian areas in this city,"Three schools shelled, one of them with a gaping hole on the side of the building. Multiple rockets raining on panicking shoppers outside a supermarket. People walking through a park forced to rush to safety as shells explode around them. These were some of the attacks that residents of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, endured in recent days as Russian forces targeted residential areas, hitting civilian infrastructure such as schools, shops, hospitals, apartment blocks and churches. CNN has geolocated and verified 13 incidents involving civilians over the past three days, as attacks intensified on Kharkiv, a city of about 1.5 million people. following Ukraine's resistance. Most of the attacks took place in the northeastern part of Kharkiv in the residential area of Saltivka. But other districts in the northwest, southeast and southwest of the city were also affected. The city's Freedom Square, the center of public life in Kharkiv, was hit with was believed to be a cruise missile, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister said. In 24 hours, 34 civilians were killed and 285 injured -- including 10 children -- in the Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service said on Thursday morning. As the Kharkiv offensive ramped up, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague announced on Wednesday that he had launched an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referred to Russia's relentless bombardment of Kharkiv, including the deliberate targeting of residential areas with ""jet artillery,"" as a ""war crime"" in a late-night address on Monday. CNN has analyzed and verified digital evidence, including videos and photos, of several indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv. Three schools hit by shelling in one day At least three schools in Kharkiv were hit by Russian military strikes on Tuesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media. In one clip, a school in the northern Saltivka neighborhood is pictured with a gaping hole in the wall, rubble and broken glass strewn across the courtyard. ""School number 17 of Kharkiv city,"" someone can be heard saying in the video. ""It flew right here, everything is in ruins, everything is fallen out, shell fragments everywhere, everything is in smoke."" The other two schools hit in shelling were just over a kilometer (around 0.6 miles) apart, in an industrial district in Kharkiv's southeastern area. Schools have not been in session since the Russian invasion began. Other schools were indirectly affected during the bombing of the center of Kharkiv on Tuesday. Viktor Kruglov, the founder of Ranok, a private school, said they managed to evacuate about 54 orphans from a boarding school for blind and visually impaired children just 15 minutes before the explosion. However, 65 people are still holed up in the basement of the school -- with no electricity or water due to the shelling. They're relying on food and water brought by volunteers, according to Valentyna Butenko, head of the non-governmental organization ""Right to Choose"" (Pravo Vyboru). The school is located 300 meters (approximately 985 feet) from the epicenter of the explosion in Freedom Square. Apartment blocks directly hit On Tuesday, two apartment buildings were directly hit, just outside City Kharkiv municipal hospital No 3. The strikes also hit an office building. In one video, a fire rages at a damaged apartment complex just across the street from the hospital. ""The building is gone,"" someone in the video says. Another video shows children and family fleeing the apartment complex, and at least two bodies on the ground. ""...animals, simply animals,"" someone said, appearing to refer to those responsible for the military strikes. ""People were driving here."" ""A house,"" another person said, adding, ""Look at what they've done."" CNN could not identify any military targets in the area. Other footage from the Saltivka neighborhood, which was shared on local media, showed a row of shops in front of an apartment building destroyed by strikes. A nearby building was also seen on fire. Security camera catches dramatic incident Five residential neighborhoods of Kharkiv were hit on Monday, according to a CNN analysis. What appeared to be surveillance-style footage of an apartment complex on Velyka Kil'tseva Street captured panicked residents rushing for safety as rockets exploded around them. The intense shelling -- at least eight explosions are seen but there are more heard -- lasts for 20 seconds. As the munitions rain down, people are seen running away. One individual is seen falling to the ground as explosions dot the ground around. A parked car explodes after taking a direct hit. After the hail of strikes stop, the individual that fell appears to crawl away, but then stops moving. Their condition is unknown to CNN. Apartment complexes on Klochkivska Street in northwestern Kharkiv, and on Vasylia Stusa Street in eastern Kharkiv were also hit on Monday. Multiple-launch rocket system attack near supermarket The Saltivka neighborhood was also hit by a multiple-launch rocket system, or MLRS, attack on Monday. Videos geolocated by CNN show multiple rockets exploding closely together near the Equator supermarket, while shoppers scramble to safety. One video shows a rocket booster lodged in the street pavement, as some people look at it. According to the Kharkiv City Council, that shelling left one female civilian dead, and 31 wounded. The wounded are made up of 15 servicemen and 16 civilians, says the city council in a press statement. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers. Dan Kaszeta, a defense specialist and an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London, said the images were consistent with a multiple rocket launch system attack. ""The appearance of at least one image of a rocket booster section lends credence to this having been a rocket attack,"" he said. Commenting on that attack, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, said: ""Kharkiv has just been subjected to massive Grad shelling! Dozens of victims."" He described the situation as ""a nightmare.""",47,5.575597147420159,1.647904341364294,3.927692806055865,24

Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement Thursday: ""I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one."" By comparison, it took three months for one million refugees to leave Syria in 2013 when departures there were at their height, according to the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. Half a million of the refugees are children, according to UNICEF, which warned Europe could be facing its largest refugee crises since World War II. Millions more people are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine, Grandi said. He added: ""International solidarity has been heartwarming. But nothing -- nothing -- can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed. Peace is the only way to halt this tragedy."" In Ukraine's capital Kyiv, residents were awoken in the early hours of Thursday by at least one large explosion in the southwest of the city, following a day of heavy shelling. To the south, the mayor of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea indicated that Russian forces had seized control, though claims remain disputed. And in the port city of Mariupol, home to roughly 400,000, residents are without electricity and water, according to local officials, as Russian troops step up their offensive. A resident of Kherson, which has about 300,000 inhabitants, described the situation there as a ""humanitarian catastrophe,"" telling CNN Thursday there had been chaos and panic in the city as residents tried to get basic necessities. According to the local resident, there is a severe lack of food and medicine -- particularly insulin -- with pharmacies being looted. The resident added that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men. The mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said Wednesday the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control. In Mariupol, the deputy mayor said on Thursday morning that the southeastern Ukrainian city had faced 26 hours of continued shelling and warned it now faces a humanitarian crisis. ""They are destroying our city with all weapons, from artillery, from airplane bombing, from tactical rockets, from multiple launch rocket systems,"" Sergei Orlov told CNN's ""New Day."" ""We do not have electricity in the whole city, we do not have water supplies, we do not have sanitary systems, we do not have heating."" Further north, Ukrainian resistance in the country's second biggest city, Kharkiv, continues to hold out, as Russian strikes hit at least three schools and damaged a cathedral and shops on Wednesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media, geolocated and verified by CNN. In a broadcast message Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed Russian forces, saying: ""You are leaving people without food, you are leaving us without medication. You are shelling evacuation routes, there's no weapon you wouldn't use against us, against free citizens of Ukraine."" Most of those who have fled the country have gone to Poland, to Ukraine's west, with large numbers also entering Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia. Dramatic video filmed Wednesday showed crowds of people on a platform at Kharkiv train station queuing to get on a train to Uzhgorod, in the west, carrying their children and pets as they fled an assault on the city. Worryingly, a ""big number"" of those crossing into Poland are unaccompanied children, according to Poland's Ambassador to the UN Krzysztof Szczerski. Many children crossing the border are leaving behind parents -- particularly their fathers, who have been called by the Ukrainian government to stay behind and fend off Russian troops, he said. Humanitarian corridors On Thursday, a second round of talks between Russia and Ukraine ended with an agreement on humanitarian corridors for civilians, but Ukraine said there were no breakthroughs beyond that. Senior Ukrainian official Mykhailo Podoliak said in a tweet: ""The second round of negotiations is over. Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved. There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors."" The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, outlined some of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion to Russian media. ""We have thoroughly discussed three points -- military, international and humanitarian, and the third one is an issue of a future political regulation of the conflict. Both positions are clear and written down. We managed to agree on some of them, but the key thing that we have reached an agreement on today was a matter of rescuing civilians who found themselves in a military clash zone. Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministries agreed on providing humanitarian corridors for civilians and on a possible temporary ceasefire in areas where evacuation is happening,"" Medinsky told journalists. Another member of the Russian delegation, Leonid Slutsky, told Russia 24 that both sides have agreed on the third round of talks, which will happen in the ""nearest future."" Meanwhile, the Czech government has declared a 30-day state of emergency from Friday in anticipation of a major influx of people fleeing the conflict. The European Union has made the ""historic decision"" to grant temporary protection to all refugees fleeing the conflict, said the bloc's Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, on Thursday. The United Nations World Food Programme has launched an emergency operation to provide food assistance to people within Ukraine and in neighboring countries following an official request from the Ukrainian government. The organization is calling for $570 million to help refugees fleeing violence amid Russia's ongoing invasion. Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement Thursday that, in addition to those who had left the country, one million people were displaced internally. Bachelet said: ""Thousands of people, including older people, pregnant women, as well as children and people with disabilities, are being forced to gather in underground shelters and subway stations to escape explosions. Many people in situations of vulnerability are separated from families and effectively trapped."" With the scale of the humanitarian disaster becoming ever more apparent, the International Criminal Court announced Wednesday it had opened an immediate active investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement Wednesday his office ""had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible."" The move came as the United States and other Western officials warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be shifting his strategy to further target cities and civilian infrastructure with heavy weapons and potentially ""tens of thousands"" of troops. The Russian government has ""strongly"" rejected accusations that it has committed war crimes in Ukraine. It's unclear exactly how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war, but the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission estimates there have been 750 civilian casualties. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers but there are fears of further casualties as Russian strikes hit built-up areas. On Wednesday, the United Kingdom said it was ""gravely concerned"" by ""reports of the use of cluster munitions"" by Russia during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. And earlier that day, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine. ""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs -- which are banned under the Geneva Convention,"" she said. Vacuum bombs, or thermobaric bombs are filled with high-temperature, high-pressure explosives and when detonated suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects. There is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine, though CNN saw Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, on February 26. The Russian advance in the south of Ukraine shows the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east. ""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea. I mean that is an obvious objective,"" NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe Richard Shirreff told CNN. He said he feared the push could cause an increase in civilian deaths as cities become ruins. ""I'm afraid to say I don't think we have seen anything yet in terms of the destruction that's likely to happen,"" Shirreff added.",47,4.04112614424361,1.2772686075051811,2.763857536738429,24
2022-03-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/what-happens-next-russia-ukraine-cmd-intl/index.html,Russia invaded Ukraine a week ago. What comes next?,"Russia's assault on Ukraine is just a week old, but its consequences have already been catastrophic. In the seven days since Russian troops invaded their western neighbor, hundreds of people have been reported dead and one million have fled for their lives. Energy prices are skyrocketing and food prices could be next. No one can say for sure what will happen in the coming days and weeks, but years of relative peace and stability in Europe have already been ruptured, and should the fighting stretch on for months, the crisis could have even greater ramifications. What happens to Kyiv? Russian President Vladimir Putin has been very clear about his basic goals in invading: He wants to disarm Ukraine, sever its ties to the NATO military alliance and end the Ukrainian people's aspirations of joining the West. He has also said he wants to rid the country of what he calls the ""gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people,"" a baseless and highly-charged reference to Ukraine's democratically-elected government and its Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian forces are encircling the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in an apparent push to topple the government, and a 40-mile-long military convoy is edging toward the city, which has been targeted by multiple rocket and missile attacks in recent days. Zelensky has vowed to keep fighting, but he is under no illusions that Putin's forces ""want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state."" Should those forces take the capital, Ukraine does have other politicians who might be eager to fill the ranks of a pro-Russian puppet regime. One of Putin's top allies in Ukraine is Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent politician and oligarch. He faces allegations of treason in Ukraine and has been under house arrest, but his exact whereabouts are unclear. Territorial goals Russian forces are also waging campaigns far from Kyiv, attempting to take control of key cities in Ukraine's south and southeast, including Kherson. The mayor of Kherson effectively admitted that Ukrainian forces had ceded control of the city on Wednesday, saying in a statement on his Facebook page that residents would have to accept the direction of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- in other words, Russian forces. One former NATO Commander told CNN: ""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea."" Richard Shirreff, NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, said the land corridor was ""an obvious objective."" ""He's had Crimea in the Russian Federation since 2014, he's only been able to supply it across the Kerch Strait bridge, and so of course he's looking to establish that land corridor down off the Sea of Azov,"" Shirreff added. If Russian forces capture the port city of Odessa, it is possible to imagine Moscow creating a land bridge extending all the way across southern Ukraine, potentially even linking Transnistria -- a separatist enclave in Moldova, where Russian troops are stationed -- to Odessa, Crimea and southern and eastern Ukraine. A partitioned Ukraine Parts of modern-day Ukraine previously belonged to interwar Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania -- and before that, to the Austro-Hungarian empire. If Putin has partition in mind, Galician Ukraine and the city of Lviv -- close to the Polish border -- could potentially be a part of a sort of rump Ukrainian state, while Russia focuses its attentions on the east of the country. A division along these lines could make Ukraine ""look like Germany in the Cold War era, with western Ukraine more dependent on Europe, and the Eastern part"" sucked into the Russian spheres of influence, which include Belarus, Russian historian and author Alexander Etkind told CNN. That kind of redrawing of borders may be an expansionist fantasy, but it could separate out what Moscow -- justifiably or not -- perceives as a more nationalist part of Ukraine. Scorched earth battle tactics So far, Ukrainian forces have managed to hold their own against the bigger and much better equipped Russian military. US officials have noted how stretched Russia's supply lines have become even in the early stages of invasion. As one senior US official explained to CNN, Russia anticipated a fast victory and may have neglected to plan for sufficient resupply of its forces. But US administration officials expect Russia to ramp up its operations in Ukraine, and Putin has previously shown scant regard for human rights or the rules of modern warfare. Russia's air force backed President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war, providing overwhelming firepower to crush the country's armed opposition groups and flattening entire neighborhoods in the process. Experts fear the Kremlin could resort to this kind of scorched earth policy in Ukraine, should resistance efforts continue to thwart their plans. Former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus said Monday that the Russian military had already started using such tactics, including cluster bomb munitions. He also said the Kremlin was bringing in thermobaric munitions -- sometimes known as vacuum bombs -- which create a prolonged pressure wave that can suck the oxygen out of a room or a person's lungs. Use of such weaponry in civilian areas is proscribed by international humanitarian law. ""I fear we'll see more of that,"" Petraeus said. ""They will rubble some cities, I suspect, because in some ways they almost have to depopulate areas or they are not secure in them, and we've seen them do that in the past."" The US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Wednesday that Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine: ""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield."" US President Joe Biden said Wednesday he believes Russia is intentionally targeting civilians in Ukraine -- but declined to say whether he believed war crimes were being committed. Sanctions The Kremlin acknowledged Wednesday that Russia's economy is taking ""serious blows,"" as unprecedented sanctions and the country's growing isolation piles pressure on its tottering financial system. International companies have begun shutting down or suspending their Russian operations. Apple, the world's most valuable company, announced Tuesday it had stopped selling all of its products in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine, while Boeing and Airbus are suspending their support for Russian airlines. Russia's energy riches haven't been directly targeted by Western sanctions, but many of the world's biggest oil companies are quitting the country or halting new investments. Moscow is also finding it harder to sell shipments of Russian crude oil to traders and refineries worried about being caught in the net of financial sanctions. But experts say Putin has overseen a push to wean Moscow's oil-dependent economy off the dollar in recent years, and has limited government spending and stockpiled foreign currencies. Putin's economic planners have sought to boost domestic production of certain goods by blocking equivalent products from abroad. Moscow has meanwhile amassed a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves -- a huge sum compared to most other countries -- that can be spent if sanctions bite. It remains to be seen whether such measures will help Russia avoid economic calamity as its invasion continues.",7,2.8932485076103003,1.8971803746183111,0.9960681329919892,22
2022-03-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/ukraine-mariupol-besieged-russia-intl/index.html,Russia squeezes southern Ukraine amid warning 'worst is yet to come',"Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the war in Ukraine is ""going according to plan"" Thursday, with residents of the key city of Mariupol facing a deteriorating humanitarian situation, as the city remains under siege by Russian forces determined to tighten their grip on Ukraine's south. ""The special military operation in Ukraine is going according to plan, in strict accordance with the schedule,"" Putin said in his Security Council broadcast on state television, using the euphemism the Kremlin uses to describe the invasion of Ukraine. ""All tasks are being successfully being carried out."" His remarks came as civilians in Mariupol were trapped without power, heating or water. France also gave a chilling warning that the ""worst is yet to come"" for Ukraine, following talks between Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. Mariupol authorities warned of a ""critical"" situation for residents amid heavy shelling. It's not clear how many of Mariupol's roughly 400,000 inhabitants have been able to evacuate the strategically important port city or how many have been killed or injured. The Russian assault on Mariupol comes as its forces also fight for control of the Black Sea city of Kherson. The mayor of Kherson indicated overnight that Russian forces had seized control of the city of about 300,000, although claims remain disputed. The advance in Ukraine's south shows Russian forces are attempting to create the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa in the west, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east. Mariupol's deputy mayor Sergei Orlov told CNN's ""New Day"" the southeastern city was now ""surrounded"" by Russian forces and was in desperate need of military and humanitarian aid. ""Our Ukrainian army and National Guard is very brave, they stand and fight for Ukraine, for Mariupol. But the situation is quite critical,"" Orlov said Thursday. ""We are asking for help, for military help, and we are waiting for military help,"" Orlov said. ""Our internal forces are very brave, but we are surrounded by the Russian army, which has more people in their army."" Following a 90-minute phone call Thursday between Putin and Macron, an Elysee source told reporters that Putin had said he intended to continue his military operation. ""Without making a prediction, we should expect the worst is yet to come. The (French) President said so yesterday as well. There is nothing in what Putin said today that should reassure us,"" the source said. Putin told Macron he was available for negotiations but emphasized that discussion must take place on the grounds of neutralization and disarmament of Ukraine, the source said. The Russian leader also said that if Kyiv wanted to talk, it must act now -- and if Ukrainians don't accept these conditions, he will obtain the same result by the military path, the source said. Putin denied having bombarded Kyiv and warned that the situation would worsen, but that it was the fault of Ukraine, the source said. France estimates that Russia's military ambition is to take all of Ukraine, the source added. Mayor: Russians creating a 'humanitarian catastrophe' Orlov warned that Mariupol was facing a humanitarian crisis after what he said had been 26 hours of continued shelling. ""They are destroying our city with all weapons, from artillery, from airplane bombing, from tactical rockets, from multiple launch rocket systems,"" Orlov said. ""We do not have electricity in the whole city, we do not have water supplies, we do not have sanitary systems, we do not have heating."" Mariupol's mayor Vadym Boichenko accused the Russian military of creating a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" in the city in a post on his Telegram account Thursday. ""These scum have found no other way to break us. They are blocking the supply and repair of electricity, water and heat. They have also damaged the railways. They have destroyed bridges and smashed trains so that we can't evacuate women, children and the elderly out of Mariupol,"" he said. ""They are blocking food supplies, blocking us like in former Leningrad [during World War II], deliberately destroying the city's critical life-support infrastructure for seven days. Again, we have no light, water or heat."" He said the city was ""working with international institutions to create a 'green corridor' for the humanitarian mission"" and seeking to get a ceasefire so electricity supplies can be restored. Deputy mayor: 'We cannot collect all the bodies' The Russian military announced advances in the Mariupol area Thursday morning. ""The units of the armed forces of the Donetsk People's Republic narrowed the encirclement of the city of Mariupol, and also took control of the settlements of Vinogradnoye, Sartaka and Vodyanoye,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman, said in a video briefing. He repeated claims the military was not targeting civilian areas in Ukraine. A day earlier, Konashenkov outlined an evacuation corridor from Mariupol. ""All civilians wishing to leave Mariupol, for security purposes, can go east along the Mariupol-Shirokino [Shyrokyne] road,"" he said. Russia routinely denies causing civilian casualties in Ukraine. However, CNN and other media and observers have extensively documented civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. Orlov said that Russian shelling had targeted multiple civilian buildings, including homes, kindergartens and schools, but he cautioned that the civilian death toll in the city remains unclear. ""We do not know how many, because we cannot collect all the bodies and we cannot count,"" Orlov said. The situation in Mariupol ""remains difficult,"" a spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Guard told CNN, while stressing that the battle was not over. ""Soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine, together with the Armed Forces, continue to defend the city,"" the spokesperson said. ""The Ukrainian military is not going to surrender the city and will strike at the occupying forces. The military will also continue to destroy enemy sabotage groups on the outskirts of Mariupol."" Mariupol lies just to the west of the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine that has been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Putin recognized the breakaway statelets of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics in the Donbas last month. ""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea. I mean that is an obvious objective,"" NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe Richard Shirreff told CNN. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. Shirreff said he feared the latest push could cause a humanitarian catastrophe as civilian deaths rise and cities become ruins. Kherson: Food, medicines in short supply, looting reported The situation in Kherson, about 260 miles to the west of Mariupol, also appeared to be worsening Thursday. One resident told CNN there had been chaos and panic in Kherson as people tried to get basic necessities. According to the resident, the city is suffering a severe lack of food and medicine -- particularly insulin -- with pharmacies being looted. The resident added that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men. Kherson's mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, called on civilians to stop looting and stealing food supplies Thursday. Kolykhaiev said in a Facebook post the ""city needs food and industrial products"" and called on residents to let the city handle distribution of products. ""We guarantee that it will reach where it is now most expected -- hospitals, orphanages, pensioners, needy, families with many children, social categories, etc,"" he said. On Wedneday, the mayor said on his Facebook page that the Ukrainian military was no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control. Kherson resident Yaroslav Kontsevyi told CNN that Russian occupants have placed checkpoints and sniper points in key places of the city. Kontsevyi said the Russian occupants were stopping civilian Ukrainian men and asking them if they were going to fight on the Russian or Ukrainian side in case of mobilization. Another local resident also noted that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men. A British military intelligence update released early Thursday noted that ""some Russian forces have entered the city of Kherson,"" but cautioned that the military situation on the ground ""remains unclear."" Hennadii Lahuta, head of the Kherson Regional State Administration, said in a statement that Russian forces had ""completely occupied"" the regional state administration building. ""We have not given up our responsibilities. The regional operational headquarters, which I lead, continues its work and addresses issues to help residents of the region. We are waiting for humanitarian aid,"" Lahuta said. A senior US defense official said the United States could not independently verify that the city of Kherson has fallen under Russian control. Mariupol is still under Ukrainian control, according to the US defense official, but Russian forces are advancing on the city from the north and from the coastline with the apparent intention of isolating it. The official added that there had been no ""appreciable"" moves by Russia, naval or otherwise, on the city of Odessa, further to the west.",47,1.060565780977277,2.105290103241839,-1.0447243222645621,24
2022-03-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/russian-convoy-stalled-outside-kyiv-intl/index.html,Here's what we know about the 40-mile-long Russian convoy outside Ukraine's capital,"For days, residents of Kyiv had been bracing themselves for a 40-mile-long convoy of Russian tanks, armored vehicles, and towed artillery to arrive for an assault on the Ukrainian capital. Days later, they're still waiting. On Thursday, US intelligence suggested that the convoy was still stalled some distance from Kyiv, backing claims made by both the Ukrainian government and UK's defense ministry. ""We still assess that the convoy that everybody's been focused on is stalled. We have no reason to doubt Ukrainian claims that they have, that they have contributed to it being stalled by attacking it,"" a senior US official told reporters. Earlier in the day, the UK's defense ministry said the convoy appears to have stalled some 30 kilometers (19 miles) outside Kyiv and had made ""little discernible progress"" over the past three days, citing intelligence. ""The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30 km from the center of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days,"" the UK statement said. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday night that while the convoy and Russia's broader push towards Kyiv ""remains stalled,"" there was a significant concern ""that maybe the window is closing to be able to get aid into cities that may become under siege."" A senior US defense official told reporters on that although the convoy is suffering shortages of fuel and food, the US has assessed that the Russians ""will again learn from these missteps and these stumbles and will try to overcome them."" The convoy's stalled progress could create multiple strategic problems for Russia. First, as the key Russian supply line for any major assault on Kyiv, it is a very large sitting target for Ukrainian forces fighting back against the invasion. Second, sitting in a 40-mile-long traffic jam for days at a time could take its toll on the morale and discipline of Russian soldiers ahead of a major military operation. Martti Kari, who previously served as Finland's assistant chief of defense intelligence, told CNN that being stranded like this is bad for morale for two reasons. ""First, the Ukrainians have drones and aircraft that could attack the convoy. Second, when you sit around in the same place rumors circulate that affect your mindset. So you become nervous and tired, which is not a good combination."" The convoy is believed to have entered Ukraine via Belarus, a key ally of Putin where Russia had moved huge numbers of troops in recent weeks to carry out what they called joint exercises. When the exercises ended, the troops didn't leave and satellite images actually showed that Russia increased their military presence in the country. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Wednesday night that the fierce Ukrainian resistance had dented Russian morale. ""More and more occupiers are fleeing back to Russia, from us, from you ... we are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week — plans those have been built for years,"" he said in a Facebook post. The latest assessments on the convoy comes after the Russian military issued its first casualty figures from the war, saying 498 of its troops had died and another 1,597 had been injured. The UK statement on Thursday said ""the actual number of those killed and wounded will almost certainly be considerably higher and continue to rise."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed ""great sorrow"" over Russian military casualties on Thursday morning. But Russia appeared to be meeting less resistance in southern Ukraine, where the mayor of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea indicated that Russian forces had seized control, though claims remain disputed. And the crucial southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol came under siege from Russian forces Thursday, as Moscow seeks to tighten its grip on the south of the country.",7,1.7527613628839804,4.079953859793667,-2.327192496909687,27
2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/politics/us-russia-ukraine-civilians-warning/index.html,US officials warn Russia will increasingly hit civilian targets and seek 'slow annihilation' of Ukraine's military,"Russia's strategy in its war on Ukraine is shifting toward a ""slow annihilation"" of the Ukrainian military, US and other Western officials tell CNN, warning that Russia could focus on a bloody and deadly bombardment of cities and civilian targets as the conflict becomes a grinding war of attrition. Ukrainian forces have so far been able to stave off Russia's initial push, maintaining control of Kyiv and other major cities. But they remain massively outgunned and outmanned. And Russia is now bringing in heavier, more destructive weaponry and increasingly striking civilian infrastructure, after an initial focus on military targets, the officials said. The shift in strategy likely reflects a recognition by Russian President Vladimir Putin that his initial plan to quickly topple Kyiv has failed, said one senior Western intelligence official -- in part because the Ukrainians have put up a stiffer than anticipated fight and in part because logistics and supply missteps have slowed the Russian advance. But Western officials now expect that Russia will ramp up heavy weapons bombardment of Ukraine's cities and potentially march in ""tens of thousands"" of troops, one US official said. Eventually, officials caution, Ukraine's military will likely run short of supplies needed to keep up the fight. The US has delivered hundreds of Stinger missiles to Ukraine over the last few days, including more than 200 on Monday, according to a US official and a congressional source briefed on the matter. But the US and NATO have made it clear they will not commit troops to defending Ukraine. 'Cruel military math' Ukraine's will to fight ""is extending this,"" said the senior Western intelligence official. ""But the cruel military math of this will eventually come to bear, absent some intervention, absent some fundamental change in the dynamic."" For Ukraine, whose military forces and civilian population have shown no signs of capitulating, the war appears poised to become a grim struggle for survival over a protracted, uncertain future. The numbers are already bleak: Russia has lost roughly 3% to 5% of its tanks, aircraft, artillery and other military assets inside Ukraine — compared with Ukrainian losses of roughly 10% of its capabilities, according to two US officials familiar with the latest intelligence. Moscow has leaned heavily on its more modern precision cruise missiles, according to a source familiar with the intelligence, heavily degrading Ukraine's military infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ukraine has continued to burn through its supply of shoulder-fired Javelin missiles. Western security assistance has flowed across the border into Ukraine in recent days, defense and intelligence officials say, although they have declined to provide details on how much, precisely what kind or how it is getting to the embattled Ukrainian forces. Public statements from Ukrainian officials suggest it's not enough. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a call Wednesday that Ukraine needs additional deliveries of weapons ""now,"" Kuleba tweeted. ""They need bullets. They need bandages. They're going to need fuel. They're going to need ammunition, in addition to the humanitarian support to help with medical assistance, sustaining hospitals, both for combat wounded and for civilians that are being hurt,"" the senior intelligence official said of Ukrainian supplies. ""And they're going to need a lot again in ammunition and the weapons resupply, because the Russian force is both numerically and qualitatively superior,"" this person said. Fears of civilian casualties In addition to grinding down Ukraine's military, US and other Western officials fear Russia's siege tactics will cause heavy civilian casualties as Moscow aims to ultimately take Ukraine's capital of Kyiv. While the first few nights of Russia's campaign were aimed at military sites, during the last three there have been missile, artillery and rocket attacks against many civilian areas, where there may be administrative buildings but no security installations. CNN has been able to confirm attacks in Irpin, near Kyiv, as well as Mariupol, Borodjanka, Kharkiv and Kherson. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of bringing weapons banned under the Geneva Conventions into Ukraine on Wednesday. ""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs -- which are banned under the Geneva Convention,"" she said. A senior defense official said Tuesday that the US could not prove that cluster munitions or vacuum bombs had been used by the Russian military. ""We're likely to see an expansion of what we've seen in the last 48 hours, which is already a great degree of civilian infrastructure damage -- whether intentional or unintentional,"" said the senior intelligence official. ""The violence level will go up. The numbers of refugees will go up. The numbers of civilian casualties and civilian dead will go up."" Russians turning to heavier forces To be sure, the Russian military's offensive has faced numerous problems -- some of its own making, officials say. A 40-mile-long convoy of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery positioned north of Kyiv is ""stalled,"" the senior defense official said Wednesday. The official said the US assesses there are multiple factors that appear to have slowed Russia's move on Kyiv, including fuel and food problems, an effective, ""stiff resistance"" from Ukrainians and potential morale problems within Russia's ranks. But the official cautioned that the Russians would learn from their mistakes and adapt. The Western intelligence official said that a week into the war, the Russian military appears to have realized its initial approach to Ukraine was problematic, which relied on the use of lighter units that were more mobile but less able to support themselves. ""I think part of what you're seeing is them now catching up, seeing now it's time to introduce heavier troops,"" the official said. ""I think the concern we have is that they seem to be now bringing in heavier forces, with more armor, more long-range artillery, heavier weapons, that are not just more destructive in their nature but, frankly, are also less precise."" Social media posts and open-source intelligence, as well as videos and other information released by Ukraine, have suggested that many Russian troops were unprepared for or even uninformed of the true nature of the mission they were being sent to accomplish. Based on that open-source reporting, Western officials believe that troop morale, at least among some ground units, is very low, officials told CNN. That could also slow Russian progress, officials said. Perhaps equally significant are Ukrainian efforts to publicize Russian casualties and allow captured Russian soldiers to call their loved ones at home -- efforts that could inform the Russian population of the war being waged in their name abroad. ""They [Russia] have to prevent knowledge of Russian combat losses in their own domestic audience in a way they have in every other conflict that they had not supposedly participated in,"" the Western intelligence official said. ""And they'll go to great lengths domestically to prevent that word from getting out."" Estimates of Russian casualties vary; Ukraine on Wednesday said 6,000 Russians have been killed or wounded, while US sources familiar with the intelligence say the assessment is closer to 2,000 or 3,000.",7,2.999598541087931,4.546582132077862,-1.5469835909899312,23
2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/politics/senate-passes-major-cybersecurity-legislation/index.html,Senate passes major cybersecurity legislation to force reporting of cyberattacks and ransomware,"The Senate on Tuesday passed major cybersecurity legation, moving one step closer toward forcing critical infrastructure companies to report cyberattacks and ransomware payments. The passage comes as federal officials have repeatedly warned of the potential for Russian cyberattacks against the United States amid the escalating conflict in Ukraine. The legislation, which still has to pass in the House, would require critical infrastructure owners and civilian federal agencies to report to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within 72 hours if they experience a substantial cyberattack. It would also require critical infrastructure companies to report ransomware payments to the federal government within 24 hours. ""As our nation continues to support Ukraine, we must ready ourselves for retaliatory cyber-attacks from the Russian government,"" Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, who was the lead author on the package of bills, said in a statement, noting that online attacks have the potential to disrupt the economy, drive up gasoline prices and threaten supply chains. The reporting requirements were introduced in the Senate after several high-profile cybersecurity and ransomware incidents put pressure on lawmakers to better protect critical infrastructure and discourage attacks. Last May, a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline prompted the company to shut down thousands of miles of pipeline and led to increased prices and gas shortages. That incident, was followed several weeks later by a cyberattack on a major US meat producer, highlighting the impact ransomware can have on vital services in the US. Peters said that the ""landmark, bipartisan bill"" would ensure that CISA is the lead agency helping critical infrastructure operators and the government respond to hacks. The Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act, which combines language from three bills, would also require the government to take a risk-based approach to cybersecurity and would also authorize the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) to ensure federal agencies can adopt cloud-based technologies. ""This is a very substantial piece of cyber legislation,"" Padraic O'Reilly, co-founder of cyber risk firm, CyberSaint, told CNN. O'Reilly said the current geopolitical landscape has made the legislation ""significantly less controversial"" as the US braces for a potential cyberattack from Russian actors. The ""risk-based"" cybersecurity requirements for the federal government ""jumped out,"" he said of the legislation. This type of cybersecurity takes into account the likelihood of something bad happening, its impact and deciding how best to spend money to make it better. The legislation would require federal agencies to use this approach, which would likely spill over into the private sector, said O'Reilly. ""To see that risk-based approach written into law ... is really quite powerful,"" he said. The 72-hour reporting deadline raised concern for some companies, according to Danielle Jablanski, an operational technology cybersecurity strategist at Nozomi Networks, who noted that information sharing may not be the top priority in a crisis. The focus instead might be on safety and critical operations, she said. ""The deadline is difficult, because there's so many priorities at stake,"" Jablanski said, adding that the legislation doesn't holistically help critical infrastructure owners and operators prioritize everything that's at stake during an attack. However, she said the government is in the best position to encourage information sharing that can benefit multiple companies and industries. Several members of the US House of Representatives, including Democrat Yvette Clarke and Republican John Katko, both of New York, are working with Peters and GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio to pass the bill in the House. Portman also said he is concerned about retaliatory cyber and ransomware attacks from Russia as the US ""rightly"" supports Ukraine. ""The federal government must quickly coordinate its response to potential attacks and hold these bad actors accountable,"" he said in a statement. During her first congressional hearing after taking office, CISA Director Jen Easterly called for cyber incident reporting to help victims of hacks, as well as to analyze the information and share it more broadly to see if similar intrusions are found elsewhere. ""We absolutely agree it's long past time to get cyber incident reporting legislation out there, and we're excited to work with you on this,"" Easterly told Peters in September.

2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/politics/blinken-russia-cyberattacks-ukraine/index.html,Biden administration remains 'on guard' for Russian cyberattacks amid war in Ukraine,"The Biden administration continues to be on alert for potential Russian criminal or state-backed cyberattacks against critical infrastructure targets in the US -- a posture that Washington assumed months ago but that has grown more acute since Russia invaded Ukraine. The US is ""very much on guard"" for potential Russian cyberattacks in light of the war, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday, adding that the Biden administration had been working to harden the defenses of US organizations and those in Ukraine. Blinken was referring to months of quiet preparation for Russian hacking capabilities -- through classified briefings and closed-door exercises -- that have gone on between the Biden administration and US critical infrastructure firms. US officials continue to say there are ""no specific, credible"" threats to the US homeland tied to tensions with Russia over Ukraine. But they want US businesses to be mindful that ransomware gangs -- or Russian state-backed hackers -- could get more aggressive as US relations with Russia hit their lowest point since the Cold War. ""We remain concerned that Russian cybercriminals will target US critical infrastructure with ransomware attacks either in support of the Russian government or to take advantage of the even more permissive operating environment inside Russia,"" senior FBI cyber official Cynthia Kaiser told state and local government officials during a call on Tuesday, sources on the call told CNN. The phone briefing was just the latest in a regular series of calls that the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have held for local government agencies and private firms to remind them to stay vigilant for digital threats. Kaiser cited a declaration of support for the Kremlin that a prominent Russian-speaking ransomware gang made on Friday amid the war in Ukraine. The hackers later amended their statement, claiming they don't support any government, but their threat to retaliate against US infrastructure has resonated with US officials. Regardless of whether Russia-aligned hackers do anything impactful, US officials hope that the extra drilling and risk assessments can make US critical infrastructure firms more secure in the medium term. And it builds on years of work the electric sector and other critical industries have done to become more resilient to physical and hacking threats. ""If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,"" US President Joe Biden said last Thursday in denouncing Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Within hours of Biden's speech, the Transportation Security Administration held an exercise with hundreds of US pipeline companies, testing how they would respond to ""a scenario of escalating cyber threats as a result of geopolitical tensions,"" Jake Rubin, a spokesperson for the American Gas Association, a trade group that helped draw up the exercise, told CNN. Before the Ukraine crisis, the White House had encouraged US electric utilities serving tens of millions of customers to adopt more cyber defensive tools -- the first in a series of ""100-day plans"" to try to improve cybersecurity in key sectors. That work came about, in part, because US officials weren't seeing enough investment in threat-detection capabilities for industrial control systems, which firms use to deliver key commodities like fuel, Mark Bristow, a CISA official, said on a February 14 webinar. Simply trading data on threats -- rather than having a fuller picture of what hacking groups are trying to do -- ""isn't going to help"" in scenarios when ""adversaries are using their A game,"" Bristow said. Now, the National Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are drawing on intelligence from those sensors to track hacking threats. The idea is that the NSA can pass along intelligence indicating that, for example, a foreign hacking group is probing for vulnerabilities in electric equipment, said Robert M. Lee, CEO of cybersecurity firm Dragos, whose technology has been adopted by some of the utilities. A reminder of the potential threat came in December, as Russia continued to mass troops along Ukraine's border in the lead up to the invasion. That month, a hacking group that caused a Saudi petrochemical plant to shut down in 2017, had probed the computer networks of US electric utilities that operate liquified natural gas facilities, cybersecurity researchers previously told CNN. The Treasury Department in 2020 sanctioned a Russian government institute for its alleged involvement in the 2017 incident. The probing of US utilities in December did not lead to any compromises, but it underscored what's at stake in the fight to secure American infrastructure -- and the progress operators are making in having better visibility of those threats. ""It's a bit of a cat and mouse team because we constantly need to evolve those things to keep up with the latest techniques that the adversaries are using,"" said Manny Cancel, who heads the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a threat-sharing hub for North American utilities.",20,4.029230750618259,5.533487346946403,-1.504256596328144,2
2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html,Brutal onslaught rages in Ukraine as Russia expands assaults on key cities,"Fierce fighting for control of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson left dozens dead as Russia's onslaught against multiple Ukrainian cities intensified Wednesday and fears over the civilian toll mounted. More than 800,000 civilians have fled since the invasion began a week ago, with fears of further casualties increasing as Russian strikes hit built-up areas. Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported ""massive shelling and bombing"" of the central part of Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, on Wednesday morning. In other developments: Sounds of air raid sirens and a new explosion in Kyiv as night falls. Fighting continues in the southern city of Mariupol, with residents reporting heavy shelling overnight. Russian forces moving towards Kyiv, including a large Russian military convoy, ""remain stalled,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday. Western sanctions are dealing ""serious blows"" to Russia's economy, the Kremlin said. On Wednesday night, CNN teams on the ground heard air raid sirens in Ukraine's third-largest city Odessa and the town of Uman, Ukraine. Meanwhile, in the capital of Kyiv, a major heating pipeline was damaged as a result of a missile strike to the area of the Central Railway station in the evening, the country's interior ministry said. The sound of the blast could be heard across the city, according to a CNN team, though the target of the strike was not clear. Kyiv's mayor Vitaly Klitschko said preliminary reports suggested there were no casualties in a blast, adding: ""We are clarifying the details."" Klitschko said in a Telegram post that despite shelling in a number of Kyiv suburbs Wednesday, ""Thank God, there are no casualties."" ""The enemy was trying to breakthrough to our city, but Ukrainian defenders are repulsing the occupiers and defending our capital."" It's unclear what caused the blast near the station. An Interior Ministry adviser said the damage was caused by the falling wreckage of a cruise missile after it had been intercepted by Ukrainian air defense systems. Kherson mayor indicates city has fallen The mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said that the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control. The announcement on the mayor's Facebook page late Wednesday follows several days of pressure on Kherson by Russian forces who had surrounded the city. Kherson City Council said earlier in the day that least 36 people had been killed in an ongoing battle for control of the area. Kherson is a strategically important city on an inlet from the Black Sea with a population of nearly 300,000. If Kherson is now under Russian control, it would be a significant turning point for the invading military -- the first major city seized. Earlier Wednesday, Ukraine disputed Russian claims of control saying Ukrainians forces were still fighting in parts of the city. The new post said Ukrainian forces had left. The mayor also told the New York Times in an interview that a group of about 10 armed Russian officers, including the commander of forces attacking the city, entered the city hall building Wednesday. He said he was informed by the Russian officers that they were planning to set up a new administration similar to those in two Russian-backed separatist statelets in eastern Ukraine, according to the NY Times interview. Late Wednesday, Hennady Lahuta, the head of Kherson regional administration, issued a message saying: ""I ask everyone who is not at home now, or who is planning to go outside, not to do so. The occupiers are in all areas of the city and are very dangerous."" Mayor Kolykhaiev did not explicitly say that the Russians controlled the city, but that ""there were armed visitors in the city executive committee today."" Strikes in Kharkiv In Kharkiv, a Wednesday morning strike on the regional police department and Kharkiv National University left the buildings engulfed by fire, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service and videos geolocated by CNN. Four people were killed and nine injured, the State Emergency Service said Wednesday, while rescuers pulled 10 people from the rubble. New videos posted to social media early Wednesday and verified by CNN showed badly damaged buildings in western Kharkiv in an area with markets, stores and residential buildings. In Kharkiv's northern neighborhood of Saltivka, a school was the latest site of Russian military strikes on Wednesday, according to a video and photo posted to social media. CNN geolocated and confirmed the authenticity of the video and photo. The school has been the site of repeated strikes in recent days. Video from the scene shows a large hole in the wall of a school, rubble strewn across a courtyard and broken glass. ""School number 17 of Kharkiv city,"" a voice says in the video. ""It flew right here, everything is in ruins, everything is fallen out, shell fragments everywhere, everything is in smoke."" Fighting took place overnight between Russian and Ukrainian forces near a Kharkiv military hospital, the head of the local police told Ukraine's public broadcaster, Suspilne News. It's unclear how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war. The UN on Tuesday reported at least 136 civilian deaths since Russia's invasion started, but cautioned the toll is likely ""much higher."" CNN could not independently verify this figure. Earlier today, Ukraine's State Emergency Service issued a statement claiming more than 2,000 civilians had been killed, before removing it. The Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure. While the US and NATO allies have aided Ukraine by sharing arms, military equipment and intelligence, as well as imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia, the alliance has thus far made clear it has no plans to send soldiers into Ukrainian territory. Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, has mounted a fierce resistance, but in a rare interview from a Kyiv bunker Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that his country -- which has a much smaller military than Russia -- needs more help to prevent the crisis from spreading across Europe. ""I've spoken to Biden many times,"" Zelensky told CNN. ""And I've told them many times that Ukraine will resist and fight stronger than anyone else but on our own against Russia we won't manage it."" Onslaught in Ukraine As Russia continued to strike key cities on Wednesday, the humanitarian cost of the invasion is steadily increasing. The International Criminal Court said on Wednesday that it has opened an investigation into alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine. ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement that 39 of the court's member states had requested for the investigation to proceed. ""Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced,"" Khan said, noting the investigation will cover incidents in Ukraine from 2013 to the present. Khan said his office ""had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible."" Meanwhile, the number of people fleeing the country continues to rise. The UN said Wednesday it had recorded the arrival of 835,928 refugees from Ukraine since the invasion began on February 24. Of those, more than 450,000 have entered Poland. ""We are looking at what could become Europe's largest refugee crisis this century,"" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said a day earlier. The UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update Wednesday that Russia's overall gains had been limited in the past 24 hours, adding this was probably due to ""ongoing logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance."" Russia has continued to target built-up areas with air strikes and heavy artillery, it added, focusing mainly on Kharkiv, Kyiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv. Russian forces moving towards Kyiv in the northern part of Ukraine, including a 40-mile Russian convoy of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery, ""remain stalled,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said during a Wednesday briefing. ""They haven't from our best estimates made any appreciable progress in the last 24-36 hours,"" Kirby said of the Russian forces moving towards Kyiv. ""Nothing very significant."" Kirby said the stall is likely due to a number of factors including Russian forces deliberately ""regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up the lost time,"" ""logistics and sustainment challenges,"" and ""resistance from the Ukrainians,"" Kirby said. In Kyiv, sick children are being treated in a hospital's underground bomb shelters. A missile hit a private maternity clinic near the capital on Tuesday, leaving the clinic damaged but still standing, according to the clinic's chief. Separately, a military strike tore through two apartment blocks in a town west of Kyiv. Russian forces also fired rockets that hit near a TV tower. In a statement Wednesday, Russia's defense ministry acknowledged carrying out long-range strikes on communications infrastructure in Ukraine. Russian and Ukrainian delegations were set to meet later Wednesday for a new round of talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a call with foreign journalists. He gave no details about the location or format of the discussions. Peskov also acknowledged in the call that the Russian economy was taking ""serious blows"" as a result of sanctions imposed by the West, but said there was a ""certain margin of safety"" and that the economy ""will stay on its feet."" A Ukrainian presidential aide told CNN the two delegations were expected to comprise the same representatives as in the first round of talks on Monday, held in Belarus near the Ukrainian border. The two sides discussed a potential ceasefire, according to a Ukrainian presidential adviser, but no concrete result emerged. In a Facebook post published Wednesday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia's claims were unchanged during Monday's talks. ""We are ready for talks, we are ready for diplomacy, but we are not in any way ready to accept any Russian ultimatums,"" he added. Meanwhile, the international community is stepping up pressure on Putin, leaving Russia increasingly isolated. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday that the UK would ""continue to tighten the noose around Putin's regime,"" adding that its use of munitions in civilian areas ""in my view already fully qualifies as a war crime."" French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe has been ""shaken"" by the war in Ukraine in an address to the nation on Wednesday.

2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/europe/russia-military-challenges-ukraine-past-wars-intl-hnk/index.html,"If the past is anything to go by, Russia will struggle to occupy Ukraine","Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion has shown strength that has surprised many observers, but one expert has warned historical precedent bodes poorly for Moscow's forces in the long term should it be unable to subdue the country quickly. ""The Russian army is overextended and in a precarious position if Ukraine becomes a protracted war,"" Seth Jones, vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based think tank, said in a social media post. ""Assuming 150,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine and a population of 44 million, that is a force ratio of 3.4 soldiers per 1,000 people. You can't hold territory with those numbers,"" Jones said. He compared that Russian force ratio to occupations after previous wars around the world, saying successful ones had force ratios that were ""astronomically higher."" For example, he said, the Allied forces occupying Germany in 1945 had 89.3 troops to 1,000 inhabitants; NATO forces in Bosnia in 1995, 17.5 troops to 1,000 inhabitants; NATO forces in Kosovo in 2000, 19.3 to 1,000, and international forces in East Timor in 2000, 9.8 to 1,000. Writing in the 2003 review of the RAND Corp. think tank, analyst and mathematician James Quinlivan said a benchmark force ratio for a successful occupation is about 20 to 1,000. US and coalition force ratios in Afghanistan in 2002 and Iraq in 2003 were only 0.5 to 1,000 and 6.1 to 1,000 respectively, according to statistics cited by Quinlivan. ""High numbers of troops and police are critical to establish basic law and order,"" Jones said. ""In fact, the number of Russian soldiers in Ukraine aren't even enough to hold any major cities for long."" And if Russian occupiers face a guerrilla war in the event the Ukrainian government falls, odds won't be in their favor, he said. ""They will be in serious danger of being picked apart by Ukrainian insurgents."" Soviet forces waged a lengthy campaign against Ukrainian insurgents after the end of World War II. Partisan warfare continued through the late 1940s in parts of western Ukraine, but the Soviets crushed most armed resistance by the early 1950s. US officials have also noted how stretched Russia's supply lines have become even in the early stages of invasion. As one senior US official explained to CNN, Russia anticipated a fast victory and may have neglected to plan for sufficient resupply of its forces. Supply lines, this official explained, are a ""definite vulnerability."" But US administration officials said Monday that Russia was expected to ramp up its operations in Ukraine. The officials warned lawmakers in classified briefings that a second wave of Russian troops will likely consolidate the country's positions within Ukraine, and could by sheer numbers be able to overcome the Ukrainian resistance, according to two people familiar with the briefings. ""That part was disheartening,"" one lawmaker told CNN. Still, a map of current Russian positions shows Moscow's forces have gained control of only a small portion of Ukraine -- a vast country just slightly smaller than the US state of Texas. And again, looking at past conflicts, Russia faces formidable challenges in taking Ukraine's urban areas, like the capital, Kyiv. ""Urban terrain offers incredible resources and advantages for a defending force to cause disproportionate numbers of causalities on an attacking element, cause the attacker to run out of time in the strategic environment, and ultimately bring the momentum of an attack to a screeching halt,"" John Spencer and Jayson Geroux wrote this month for the Modern War Institute at West Point, home of the US Military Academy. The pair, former US and Canadian military officers respectively, pointed to conflicts from World War II to the Korean War to Chechnya to Syria, where urban defenders were able to inflict high losses on their attackers. With a 40-mile (64-kilometer) column of Russian military vehicles and armor lined up in the direction of Kyiv, what Spencer and Geroux point out happened to Russian armor in Grozny, in Chechnya, in 1995, might be especially ominous for Moscow's current forces. Chechen separatists, operating in teams with as few as two men, and using only rifles, grenades and grenade launchers, set on Russian armored vehicles from basements and the upper floors of buildings, they wrote. ""Main tanks and other weapons could not effectively return fire,"" Spencer and Geroux said. ""Once in their trap, ambush teams would strike the vulnerable points of Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers, hit the lead and trail vehicles, quickly withdraw, and then move up the flanks to strike the now paralyzed Russian columns again,"" they said. Over three days in January 1995, one Russian brigade lost 102 of its 120 armored vehicles and 20 of 26 tanks to the Chechen separatists in Grozny, they said. If this example even holds partially true for what the Russian invaders will face in Ukraine's cities, the war will not be coming to any quick end.",7,4.7418842083322374,3.1448059503173225,1.597078258014915,23
2022-03-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-tuesday-intl-hnk/index.html,Strike hits TV tower in Kyiv as Russia ramps up assault on key Ukrainian cities,"Russian forces fired rockets at a TV tower in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on Tuesday, hours after Moscow warned of strikes on other facilities linked to Ukrainian security agencies. The rocket attack took out broadcasting hardware, raising fears that Moscow is attempting to knock out the city's communications infrastructure. Ahead of the strikes, Russia's military urged nearby residents to flee. The attack, along with a beef-up of assaults on other key cities, brings the Russian invasion right into the heart of the nation. Another rocket hit a private maternity clinic near the capital Kyiv on Tuesday, leaving the clinic damaged but still standing, according to the Adonis maternity clinic chief Vitaliy Gyrin's Facebook post. Separately, a military strike tore through two apartment blocks in a town west of Kyiv. As the rockets hit Kyiv on Tuesday, a 40-mile Russian convoy of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery was headed toward the Ukrainian capital, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies. However, a US official said the convoy has been stalled due to fuel supply issues. The Russian advance on Kyiv remains ""basically... where it was yesterday"" according to a senior defense official, who also said there were signs that they were running out of food. While Ukraine mounts a defense against the Russian onslaught, some 677,000 people have fled the country in ""less than a week,"" with 150,000 fleeing in the last 24 hours alone, according to the United Nations. The UN has also raised concerns for the millions of people still in the country, with UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths saying this is the ""darkest hour"" for the people of Ukraine. ""Families with small children are hunkered down in basements and subway stations or running for their lives to the terrifying sound of explosions and wailing sirens,"" he said in a statement. In his State of the Union speech Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said President Vladimir Putin ""badly miscalculated"" when he invaded Ukraine and announced a ban on Russian aircraft from US airspace which he said would further isolate Russia and squeeze its economy. He reiterated that US forces would not deploy to the Ukraine -- instead, they were deployed to Europe to defend America's NATO allies ""in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west."" In an exclusive interview with CNN and Reuters from a bunker ahead of the speech, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated calls for the US and NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine or put boots on the ground, saying ""I do believe that leaders do have to support democratic countries and they have to help them."" Asked if he felt Ukraine was wasting its time by talking with Russia, he said: ""We'll see."" On Monday, Ukrainian and Russian officials met for the first time since Moscow began their assault last week. Biden and Zelensky held a 30-minute phone conversation on Tuesday. Biden, the White House said, ""underscored the United States' sustained help for Ukraine, including ongoing deliveries of security assistance, economic support, and humanitarian aid."" Here's what to know Russia shifted to an aggressive bombing campaign, increasingly hitting civilians Freedom Square in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv was targeted by rockets, killing at least 10 people The defensive line the southern city of Kherson fell and Russian troops were seen driving around Leader of the self-declared separatist region in Donetsk says Russian-backed separatists plan to surround the port city of Mariupol Ukrainian President Zelensky pleas for Ukraine's immediate membership to the EU The attack in Kyiv came just hours after the Russian military threatened to carry out strikes in Kyiv, though it said its targets were Ukrainian State Security Agency facilities and the country's psychological operations unit, according to a statement reported by Russian state media TASS. In videos and social media posts shared soon after the strike, plumes of smoke were seen swirling around the red-and-white steel TV tower building, which is located near the city's Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center (BYHMC). In a statement, BYHMC said the remembrance site was struck by Russian forces. ""Putin seeks to distort and manipulate the Holocaust to justify an illegal invasion of a sovereign democratic country is utterly abhorrent,"" said BYHMC Advisory Board Chair Natan Sharanksy, adding that it is ""symbolic"" that the attack happened where an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 people were shot by the Nazis. Russian forces also attacked key cities in Ukraine from several sides, scaling up its bombardment of Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, in the northeast and breaking through a heavily contested port city in the south. Russia's actions on Tuesday mark a far less restrained bombing campaign, raising concerns that more civilians could be hit in strikes. The UN says that at least 102 civilians have been killed across the country and 304 injured, though those figures are likely to underestimate the true toll. US officials also warned that the sheer breadth of Russian firepower could overwhelm Ukrainian resistance. Russia's military is far bigger and more powerful than Ukraine's by just about every measure, but Ukraine's allies, including the European Union, are scrambling to send more weapons into the country to aid its defense. On Tuesday, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned that ""the enemy is on the outskirts of the capital,"" but the Ukrainian military is ""preparing to defend Kyiv."" ""Fortifications and checkpoints have been built at the entrances to the city. I ask everyone to keep calm. Do not go outside unnecessarily and stay in shelters in case of alarm,"" he said in a video message. In an interview with CNN Tuesday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told CNN that Russia ""dominates in the sky"" while Ukrainian forces have sought to destroy ground forces headed towards Ukrainian cities. ""Our pilots are fighting fiercely against them, but we also have losses,"" Kuleba said. ""So the Russians use their fighting jets and bombers to attack our cities and we need to counter this threat."" He added, ""This are the two most urgent requests that we lodged with our partners."" Zelensky's plea President Zelensky made an impassioned plea to the European leaders earlier Tuesday to grant Ukraine immediate membership to the EU, saying his country was fighting for survival. Zelensky's plea came as Russia accelerated strikes on Kharkiv, which was rocked by a large explosion that incinerated cars, blew out windows and destroyed a large government building in the main Freedom Square. Emergency services said at least 10 people were killed and 24 injured in the strike, which Zelensky described as an ""act of terror"" on civilians in a Facebook post. Late Monday, at least five separate residential areas in Kharkiv were hit by rockets, according to CNN analysis of social media videos. During a trip to Poland on Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the Russian invasion ""worse than our predictions,"" pointing to attacks like those seen in Kharkiv's neighborhoods. ""It is clear that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use barbaric and indiscriminate tactics against innocent civilians to bomb tower blocks, to send missiles into tower blocks, to kill children, as we're seeing in increasing numbers,"" he said. A Kharkiv resident named Tetyana, 66, told CNN that a shell hit her house early Tuesday morning, shattering its windows. Tetyana -- who sleeps in her shoes and coat since the invasion began -- ran to her basement where her relative Oleg told her that his car had burned down and ""the school in the yard was totally destroyed."" The day before, CNN confirmed five residential areas in the city had been hit by military strikes on Monday using videos shared on social media. Dramatic video, taken by a surveillance-type camera at an apartment complex on Velyka Kil'tseva St, shows repeated explosions from one strike that landed in a parking lot and walkway. The intense shelling -- at least eight explosions are seen but there are more heard -- lasts for 20 seconds. As the munitions rain down, people are seen running as the explosions dot the ground: one individual falls to the ground as explosions surround them. A parked car explodes after taking a direct hit. On Klochkivska Street, graphic videos shows blood and body parts outside of a small grocery store. ""It's horrible, guys,"" a voice in the video says. ""Right in my part of the city. Boots and leg were removed, here's parts of brain."" Russian forces enter port city Russian-backed forces have also made gains down South. In the port city of Kherson -- west of Mariupol and north of the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014 -- Ukrainian defensive lines appear to have fallen and Russian military vehicles have been seen driving inside the city. The leader of the self-declared separatist region in Donetsk said he expects his forces to surround Mariupol on Tuesday. The town of Volnovakha, half-way between Mariupol and Donetsk, was almost completely surrounded, Denis Pushilin added. Ukraine has accused Russia of committing war crimes by targeting civilians, and on Monday, the International Criminal Court said it would open an investigation into Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- a move that was welcomed by Kyiv. The Kremlin has denied the accusations, repeatedly saying it is not targeting civilian areas. A humanitarian crisis As bitter fighting takes place across the country, many Ukrainians are fleeing the country at a pace that could turn into ""Europe's largest refugee crisis this century,"" the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said Tuesday. Some 677,000 people have fled Ukraine in ""less than a week"" with 150,000 having left in the last 24 hours alone, UNHCR's deputy High Commissioner Kelly Clements said Tuesday. Clements said the UNHCR launched ""emergency appeals"" to donors for $1.7 billion in humanitarian support for people in Ukraine and refugees. Many of them are women who have had to leave behind their fathers and husbands as men aged 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country. ""Families with small children are hunkered down in basements and subway stations or running for their lives to terrifying sounds of explosions and wailing sirens,"" UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said. ""Casualty figures are rising fast. This is the darkest hour for the people of Ukraine."" Foreigners are also desperately trying to leave the country, and some have found themselves waiting in the cold to get out. Others have endured racism from border guards. Some Ukrainians have opted to stay and join the resistance. Volunteers are pouring into the capital, where there's a feeling of defiance among many. Some are gathering bottles to make Molotov cocktails. This story has been updated.",47,2.4362082071337756,4.4223849526439025,-1.986176745510127,25
2022-03-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/politics/us-intelligence-putin-state-of-mind/index.html,US intelligence agencies make understanding Vladimir Putin's state of mind a top priority,"The US intelligence community has made evaluating Russian President Vladimir Putin's state of mind a top priority in recent days as it seeks to establish how that is affecting his handling of the rapidly escalating Ukraine crisis, according to two sources familiar with the effort. The efforts come as longtime Putin-watchers have publicly speculated that his behavior has become increasingly erratic and irrational. Since he launched Russia's invasion of Ukraine last Wednesday, senior US officials have asked intelligence agencies to gather any new information they can on how the Russian leader is faring and how his mindset has been impacted by the unexpectedly unified and tough response from European neighbors and allies around the world. The US intelligence community has spent decades decoding the former KGB officer, who has effectively ruled Russia since 1999. But while the United States has tremendous institutional knowledge of the man, it has a notoriously poor view into his day-to-day decision-making. The Kremlin remains what intelligence officials call a ""hard target"" -- incredibly difficult to penetrate through traditional espionage. There has not been any new comprehensive assessment that indicates a particular change to Putin's overall health, said one US official. And officials have been on guard for the possibility that Putin's strategy may well be to project instability, in an attempt to push the US and allies to give him what he wants for fear that he could do worse. But the sudden burst of interest reflects a sense among some intelligence officials that Putin's decision-making in Ukraine has been out of character -- perhaps due to what some previous intelligence reports suggest has been protracted isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Everything US has [is] in [the] realm of conjecture because Putin's decisions and statements don't seem to be making sense,"" said one source familiar with recent intelligence reporting on the topic. ""For years, decades Putin has acted according to a pretty specific template."" In a classified briefing for lawmakers on Monday evening, Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, said the US intelligence community does not have good insight into Putin's state of mind, according to a lawmaker who was present. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who attended the Senate briefing, confirmed that Putin's state of mind had come up, but he declined to elaborate on what had been shared. He did say, however, that regardless of the briefing, he personally is worried about Putin's mindset. Scores of raw intelligence reports The intelligence community has produced scores of raw intelligence reports from sources as information pours in about the war. One such report that has circulated to more than a dozen agencies cites a source who has relayed that Putin's behavior has become ""highly concerning and unpredictable"" over just the last two days, according to a copy obtained by CNN. But in an indication of how difficult this information is to obtain directly, the description came secondhand to the FBI from a source who had talked to another, unknown source ""with excellent access."" The report notes that this person had in the past provided information that intelligence agencies were able to independently corroborate. The source behind the report told the FBI that Putin ""expressed extreme anger"" over Western sanctions put in place in response to his attack on Ukraine and ""felt that the sanctions had escalated the situation faster than he expected and beyond what he considered to be appropriate."" Precisely which sanctions so infuriated Putin is unknown; that portion of the report is redacted. The report also notes that the circulation of accurate information about the war has been extremely limited within Russia, even at the highest levels of society. For example, many people and well-connected individuals with the means to leave Russia before airports and borders were closed have remained in the country, according to the report -- suggesting that they had not known about the closures in advance. The report, which originated from the FBI, comes with some caveats: It acknowledges that the source who provided the information to the FBI ""may have provided the information to influence and inform"" US decision-making -- in other words, that it might be an information operation designed to manipulate the United States. And officials caution that raw intelligence should not be taken as fact. It has not been evaluated for reliability or analyzed for its implications. But the report has nevertheless caused other agencies inside the Biden administration to ask the FBI to follow up with its source for additional information. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA and the FBI declined to comment. A long history Speculation about Putin's mental health began after he gave a speech on Thursday laying out a warped, revisionist history that purported to justify his intervention in Ukraine. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, tweeted on Friday that Putin ""has always been a killer, but his problem now is different & significant"" -- and suggested he was basing his assessment on intelligence briefings given to him as the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""I wish I could share more,but for now I can say it's pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin,"" Rubio wrote. ""It would be a mistake to assume this Putin would react the same way he would have 5 years ago."" For some, the boldness of Putin's decision to invade -- as well as his implied threat to use nuclear weapons -- is a break with the carefully calculated and far more limited military campaigns he has launched in the past. Video footage of the Russian President seated dozens of feet away from his senior military advisers during meetings and gleefully dressing down one of his spy chiefs on television have only underscored the image of an isolated leader, acting on his own counsel alone. By Sunday, the floodgates had opened. Former Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul tweeted that Putin had ""changed,"" and sounded ""completely disconnected from reality"" and ""unhinged."" Former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper, who is a national security analyst at CNN, also called Putin ""unhinged"" and warned, ""I worry about his acuity and balance."" Other longtime Putin watchers argue that the Russian President's recent actions are relatively consistent with the man US intelligence has fixated on for decades, noting that he has long demonstrated a willingness to risk military defeat in operations that the United States thought offered no chance of success -- including ordering a second invasion of Chechnya in 1999, just three years after the Russian military had already been defeated there once. ""This is not different than anything he's said before, he's just saying it all at once in a very stark way. And he's willing to do unspeakable things -- but he's always been willing to do unspeakable things,"" said Beth Sanner, a former briefer to then-President Donald Trump and a CNN national security analyst. Putin isn't ""insane or unhinged,"" Sanner said. Rather, she said, he is ""highly emotional right now because of what he was about to embark upon ... and he has been very, very isolated, which adds to that emotional sense. But I don't think he's crazy."" One US official echoed that assessment to CNN, arguing that Putin is acting in a way that he has long signaled he was capable of. Rather than a change in his mental acuity, this person said, officials believe he's simply become enraged -- making it impossible for his senior advisers to give him frank assessments. Even his command to put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert Sunday isn't unprecedented. In 2014, when Putin annexed Crimea, he also raised the possibility he might put his nuclear forces on high alert, which then as now raised the specter of nuclear weapons being introduced into the conflict. Russia's nuclear doctrine, published in 2020, also includes a first-use nuclear policy. The Kremlin ""reserves the right to use nuclear weapons,"" including ""for the prevention of an escalation of military actions and their termination on conditions that are acceptable for the Russian Federation and/or its allies."" Still, a source familiar with recent intelligence reporting on the topic said, it is ""difficult to achieve conclusion of any confidence regarding Putin's state of mind. Would need SIGINT of phone call/video of leader losing it on his cabinet or something like that."" SIGINT, or ""signals intelligence,"" is an intelligence community term that refers to intercepted communications. ""Real-time communication between Russian cabinet leaders,"" this person said, is a ""very hard target."" Ultimately, this official and others say, understanding Putin's recent behavior is a matter of analysis -- not intelligence. It's possible, officials say, that they may never have an answer.",20,4.620584981362894,4.942584096325287,-0.3219991149623933,6
2022-03-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/politics/blinken-russia-ukraine/index.html,Blinken condemns Russia for killing civilians in Ukraine,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned Russia for killing civilians in Ukraine, raising the idea that Russia should be kicked off the United Nations Human Rights Council during a speech before the council Tuesday morning. Blinken told the UN Human Rights Council that Russian strikes ""are hitting schools, hospitals and residential buildings."" ""They are destroying critical infrastructure, which provides millions of people across Ukraine with drinking water, gas to keep them from freezing to death, and electricity,"" Blinken said. ""Civilian buses, cars, and even ambulances have been shelled. Russia is doing this every day -- across Ukraine."" The remarks by the top US diplomat come after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of war crimes for bombing the city of Kharkiv. Over the past two days, Russian attacks have hit civilians, suggesting a shift towards a far more aggressive bombing campaign. Earlier Russian attacks were more focused on military targets. On Tuesday, at least 10 people were killed and 35 injured in rocket strikes by Russian forces on the center of Kharkiv, according to Ukraine's Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko. A large explosion destroyed a government building in central Kharkiv, according to videos of the incident posted by the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ukrainian government officials. The UN says that at least 102 civilians have been killed across the country and 304 injured, though those figures are likely to underestimate the true toll. A senior US defense official said the Russian military is showing signs of being risk averse with its own troops, but they're not with civilians, noting the Russian defense ministry was openly admitting it would target Ukrainian government infrastructure in Kyiv. ""We can't say definitively that they are deliberately targeting civilian population areas or civilians. We can't prove that,"" the official said Tuesday. ""But they certainly are not as risk averse when it comes to the impact they're having on the civilian population as they seem to be with their own troops."" The UN Human Rights Council is made of up 47 member states elected by the UN general assembly, and Russia is one of the countries on the council. ""One can reasonably ask whether a UN member state that tries to take over another UN member state -- while committing horrific human rights abuses and causing massive humanitarian suffering -- should be allowed to remain on this Council,"" Blinken said. Blinken also criticized countries such as China who have not clearly stated that Russia is the sole perpetrator of this crisis. ""Council members should stop using language implying that all sides bear equal responsibility for the unprovoked attack of one side,"" he said. ""This isn't evenhanded -- it's wrong -- and fails to place accountability where it belongs. The same goes for members who argue, falsely, that denouncing human rights abuses is 'politicizing' the situation. It is failing to speak up about human rights abuses that politicizes the situation."" Blinken challenged the UNHRC to come together to try and prevent an even more deadly war. ""These are the human rights abuses this Council was created to stop. If we cannot come together now, when will we come together?"" Blinken asked. Zelensky also made an impassioned plea Tuesday for European leaders to ""prove"" their solidarity with his country. ""We are fighting for our life,"" he said in a speech to the EU Parliament earlier on Tuesday.",47,4.121053022407445,4.150108024148767,-0.02905500174132225,4
2022-03-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/europe/kyiv-freezing-conditions-residents-tuesday-intl/index.html,Freezing temperatures add to Kyiv's problems as Russian troops approach Ukrainian capital,"Residents of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv are facing worsening conditions as a Russian military column more than 40 miles long bears down on the city. Thousands of residents are sheltering in unheated basements, underground parking lots and subway stations and a sudden cold snap has blanketed the city with snow, making the situation even more difficult. Viktoriya and her family say leaving their Kyiv home to spend the night in a bomb shelter may have saved their lives. When they returned on Tuesday morning, they discovered that bullets had pierced two windows in their apartment overnight. One of them shattered an electrical socket nearby, leaving a hole where the plug would normally go. ""I realized there is no place where I can feel safe now,"" said Viktoriya, 38, who asked CNN not to use her full name. ""My home is not my castle any more. All the time, something is thundering, exploding, shooting."" And she said there is no relief when things go quiet. ""It becomes even more anxious in the moments of silence, because you know they are not going to last,"" she said. Viktoriya says she and her family have been spending most of their time in the shelter, since they have a small son and worry about being able to keep him safe in their apartment. Many other families with children use the shelter, she says, so they can keep each other company; the adults also find it comforting being around each other and sharing the burden of worry and the feeling of hopelessness. ""Life changed completely in just a moment, and you can't influence the situation in any way,"" she said. ""Now it's no longer you who controls your life, but someone else. And whatever you decide: Whether to stay in Kyiv living in the basement or to go somewhere where it's calmer, it means the same, you have to leave home."" ""The war has only lasted four days so far, but it seems like it has been with us for an infinitely long time. It's a terrible 'Groundhog Day' feeling,"" she added. People have spent hours waiting in long lines at grocery stores and pharmacies in the city since they opened for the first time following a 36-hour curfew on Monday. For now, the city's key infrastructure is holding up. Electricity, heat and water are available as normal, but fears of potential disruptions to supplies have ratcheted up, as the Russian military closes in on the city. The 40-mile-long (64-kilometer) Russian military convoy -- made up of armored vehicles, tanks, towed artillery and other logistical vehicles -- has reached the outskirts of Ukraine's capital, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies. US officials who were previously surprised by fierce resistance that saw ordinary citizens take up arms to fight the invasion now fear the situation is becoming ""a lot more challenging"" for Ukrainians. The officials said in a briefing on Monday that Russia would likely lay siege to Kyiv, leading to ugly scenes of urban warfare, one of the people familiar with the matter said. And on Tuesday afternoon, Russian military warned it would carry out strikes against the facilities of the SBU -- Ukraine's State Security Agency -- and the 72nd Main Center for Information and Psychological Operations [PSO] in Kyiv. The statement from the Russian Defense Ministry urged residents near some targets to ""leave their homes,"" Russian state news agency TASS reported.",47,3.9310990328230817,3.6634332385752932,0.26766579424778847,6

Officials spoke to their overall preparedness during a news briefing ahead of the address, which will see hundreds of lawmakers gather in the House chamber and is designated as a National Special Security Event. Under the federal designation, the US Secret Service is the lead agency for the design and implementation of the operational security plan. During such an event, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is responsible for response and recovery operations, and the FBI is the lead for investigative work and counterterrorism. ""Certainly, the events abroad are, not only just in the physical space, but also in cyberspace,"" said Christopher Rodriguez, director of Washington's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, noting the potential threat from Russia in the form of cyberattacks and disinformation. ""There is the potential for Russian disinformation,"" Rodriguez said during the briefing, standing alongside Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and local and federal law enforcement officials. ""This wouldn't be the first time the Russians have done that across the United States in the last several years."" Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee told reporters Monday that the department is receiving help from the Philadelphia and Baltimore police departments. Capitol Police are on high alert as well, requesting installation of a fence around the inner perimeter of the Capitol grounds to bolster security. Customs and Border Protection's Air and Marine Operations will provide aerial support to the Secret Service for the event, according to a CBP spokesperson. The skies near Washington will be more restricted than usual during the address. A bulletin to pilots published by the Federal Aviation Administration says special provisions that typically allow small aircraft to fly in an area 30 nautical miles from the city will be suspended from 8 to 11 p.m. ET on Tuesday. Pilots will still be able to land and take off from Dulles International, Baltimore-Washington International and Manassas Regional airports, so long as they file a certain type of flight plan and are talking with air traffic controllers via radio. Officials prepare for potential trucker convoys Contee told reporters that a trucker convoy would be allowed into the city, but the department is prepared for possible disruptions. Further, Contee said truckers who refuse to move may face arrest. ""Obviously, we'd like to get voluntary compliance,"" Contee said. ""If we have someone who fails to obey the lawful directive of an officer, a traffic officer in this sense -- you know, 'Hey move your vehicle out of the roadway,' that type of thing -- that person ultimately ... could be arrested for that type of behavior and disruption."" Officials across the region have been preparing for disruptions from truckers for more than a week. Concerns over security prompted both US Capitol Police and Bowser to request National Guard assistance. The Department of Defense has approved 700 members of the National Guard and 50 large tactical vehicles. Over the weekend, the Department of Homeland Security warned state and local officials that the reported convoys headed to the Washington, DC, region could create public safety issues and have the potential to attract domestic violent extremists. However, federal law enforcement agencies have ""not observed any substantiated threats of violence"" from extremists, according to a DHS intelligence notice issued Saturday and obtained by CNN. Some people are discussing plans to organize large semi-truck convoys to Washington, DC with the goal of interrupting military and police security near the US Capitol during a range of potential dates in March and April, the document said, based off FBI reporting. The planned arrival to the region around the State of the Union ""could raise the public profile of any associated convoys that do materialize, increasing the likelihood that the protest activity could attract some domestic violent extremists,"" the notice said. Although there is no substantiated threat of violence, the threat of attack during a convoy event ""probably is elevated,"" according to the notice, because aspects of the convoy complaints overlap with domestic violent extremist grievances related to Covid-19 restrictions. Covid-19 mitigation measures have been a ""key driver"" of domestic extremist violence over the past two years, it said. ""We have resources that are deployed, very much coordinating with all of our federal partners here to make sure that we have a safe State of the Union, and peaceful First Amendment assembly, whatever day it shows up,"" he said during a news conference with federal and local officials. The enhanced security posture will be in place ""as long as it needs to be in place,"" Contee added. Homeland Security officials have been warning of the potential for disruption from US-based convoys since before the Super Bowl earlier this month. Reports of various convoys have sprung up in the past few weeks only to fizzle out without materializing into a substantial protest. On Monday, CNN affiliate KOAM reported that the ""People's Convoy,"" which started in California, had stopped in Missouri enroute to Washington, DC. The size and plans of the convoy are unclear. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and other DHS officials met Friday with Bowser and her public safety team to prepare for joint security efforts ahead of the State of the Union address and in anticipation of potential trucker convoys. During the meeting Friday, officials discussed a variety of options to help the city manage potential convoy disruptions, such as the possibility of revoking commercial driver's licenses if warranted, a source said. Additionally, to prevent DC from becoming the first and last line of defense against the convoy, the group discussed involving mayors and city officials along the convoy route as needed, according to the source. There was also discussion, the source said, of whether weigh stations along the route could be used to hold back some of the trucks and prevent hundreds of trucks from arriving at once. On Monday, Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a tweet that the Biden administration had requested the assistance of state National Guards to deploy to Washington. ""I have rejected this request -- there will be no @FLGuard sent to D.C. for Biden's State of the Union,"" he tweeted. Asked about the governor's assertion, Contee said that ""we will be using the DC National Guard for the Metropolitan Police Department"" for State of the Union security. ""That was the mayor's request for that and her insistence, as a matter of fact, that we have the DC National Guard for DC streets,"" he said about the city's posture. According to two defense officials, there was no request for other states to provide National Guard support for the State of the Union. There was a general request for help supporting the region as it relates to the potential trucker convoy. Approximately 100 members of the New Jersey and Vermont National Guards and 80 members of the West Virginia National Guard are providing support for the potential trucker convoys, but the Florida National Guard is not providing any such support.

2022-02-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/politics/cnn-poll-russia-ukraine-us-aid/index.html,"CNN poll: Most Americans want US to do more to stop Russia, but most also oppose direct military action","Americans overwhelmingly favor increased economic sanctions against Russia and broadly support further action to stop Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but most oppose direct US military action, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Eighty-three percent of Americans said they favored increased economic sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion, with just 17% opposed. New sanctions and economic restrictions aimed at Russia were announced by the US and other countries while the poll was in the field on Friday and Saturday. Support for increased sanctions in the new poll stands well above the 67% who favored the same in 2014 amid Russia's incursion into eastern Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea. A smaller majority, 62%, also wanted to see the US do more to stop Russian military action in Ukraine, with 38% saying the country has already done enough. But the public is opposed to direct military action by the US: Only 42% were in favor of such a move should sanctions fail to work, with 58% opposed. Among those who said the US should do more to stop Russia's military incursion, though, 58% were in favor of the use of military action if sanctions failed. There's little sign that the public is rallying around President Joe Biden's response to the crisis, despite the broad support for the type of sanctions his administration has put in place. Just 42% said they trust Biden at least moderately to make the right decisions regarding the situation in Ukraine, about on par with his overall approval rating in recent polling. These results, like most of Biden's numbers, are deeply polarized, with 84% of Democrats but just 9% of Republicans saying they trust his decision-making at least moderately. When it comes to how the US should proceed, however, the partisan divides are far more muted, and in some cases nearly nonexistent. More than 8 in 10, across party lines, backed increased economic sanctions (84% among Democrats and Republicans, 81% among independents), and majorities said the US should be doing more to stop Russia (65% among Republicans, 64% among Democrats and 57% among independents). Similarly, majorities across parties opposed military action should sanctions fail (60% among independents, and 56% each among Democrats and Republicans). There are, however, generational differences: Americans under age 45 were 11 percentage points less likely than older Americans to support increased sanctions and 10 points less likely to say the US should do more against Russia, though neither age group favored US military action. Americans who have served in the military or live in a household with someone who's served were generally more likely to favor action against Russia than were those in non-military households: 87% favored sanctions in veteran households versus 81% in non-veteran households, 67% said the US should do more vs. 59% in non-veteran households, and 51% favored military action vs. 38% in non-veteran households. Most Americans (71%) said the US should consider the impact on gas prices when deciding its policies toward Russia, although only about one-third (34%) said it should serve as a major factor. There is a partisan gap here, with 45% of Republicans versus about 3 in 10 Democrats (28%) and independents (30%) saying it should be a major factor. Broad majorities of the public said that they were paying attention to the situation in Ukraine (79% were following at least somewhat closely) and that they were worried about the conflict leading to broader war in Europe (80% very or somewhat worried), leading to Russian attacks elsewhere (77%) or threatening US national security (72%). But only about 3 in 10 Americans expressed deep concern about each of these possibilities or said they were following the news very closely. Those paying at least some attention were modestly more likely than those who haven't been following the situation to support sanctions (85% vs. 74%) and to say the US should do more to stop Russian military action (63% vs. 55%), but both groups were about equally unlikely to support US military intervention. Those following more closely were also more likely to be very worried about whether the conflict would lead to a broader war in Europe (35% vs. 20%), Russian attacks elsewhere (37% vs. 21%) or threats to US national security (29% vs. 18%). The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS February 25-26 among a random national sample of 1,011 adults surveyed by text message after being recruited using probability-based methods. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. It is larger for subgroups.",4,3.3980195623101923,3.0008725407762964,0.3971470215338959,0
2022-02-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/politics/us-kyiv-fears/index.html,US officials fear the worst is yet to come for Kyiv,"Ukrainian forces have so far managed to stave off Russian ground forces massed less than 20 miles north of the embattled capital Kyiv -- but though they've defied US intelligence predictions that the city would likely fall within one to four days of a full-scale Russian assault, US officials warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin could imminently increase the intensity of the attack. Stiffer than expected Ukrainian resistance and Russia's own logistical missteps have bogged down Russia's advance, US and western officials say, sparking a fragile optimism. The US has also continued sharing downgraded intelligence with the Ukrainians, including about Russian military moves, in an attempt to help Ukraine on the battlefield, two of the sources told CNN. But intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance. ""From a purely military/tactical standpoint, Russia has the manpower and firepower to take Kyiv. No question,"" said an American source familiar with the intelligence. ""And no matter how much resistance the Ukrainians put up."" Roughly a quarter of Russia's amassed troops have yet to enter Ukraine, a senior defense official told reporters on Monday -- a potential ""second wave,"" according to two sources familiar with the intelligence -- and defense officials say Putin could yet order a far less restrained bombing campaign, including airstrikes, long-range missiles and artillery. ""They have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on Kyiv, and one of the things that could result is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt in both the size and the scale of their targeting of Kyiv,"" a senior defense official told reporters on Monday. Administration officials warned lawmakers in classified briefings Monday that a ""second wave"" of Russian troops will likely consolidate the country's positions within Ukraine and by sheer numbers be able to overcome the Ukrainian resistance, according to two people familiar with the briefings. ""That part was disheartening,"" one lawmaker told CNN. The officials also said Russia was likely going to lay siege to Kyiv and predicted ugly scenes of urban warfare, one of the people familiar with the matter said. And at the end of the day, officials tracking the campaign say, the ugly truth remains that Ukraine is massively outgunned and outmanned -- even as Russia has made what military strategists say are a number of obvious blunders. Already, Russia appears to be ramping up its campaign in the east and the south. In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Russian forces have launched rocket attacks on at least one residential neighborhood that have killed civilians, according to Ukrainian officials and multiple social media videos geolocated by CNN. Meanwhile, in the small southern city of Mykolaiv, located on an inlet that would be a useful access point for Russians to bring in troops and supplies, the fighting has been among the most intense in Ukraine in recent days. Concerns about Putin's state of mind Perhaps most ominously, western officials are also warily watching Putin, under pressure from crushing economic penalties that have tanked the ruble and caused the Russian stock market to close. They fear those sanctions, combined with the lack of progress in Kyiv, may cause the unpredictable Russian leader to lash out even more. Senior US lawmakers familiar with the intelligence, western officials and former senior US officials with deep experience in Russia have begun to openly raise questions about the Russian leader's mental stability. ""Putin has been completely isolated, partly because of Covid,"" said the American source familiar with the intelligence. ""He's now basically just by himself, completely cut off from most of his advisers, isolated geographically ... the only people talking to him are sycophants who are just feeding his resentment."" The source added that the intelligence suggested Putin has not even been listening to his oligarchs -- traditionally the people who have had a key influence on his decision making. Questions about Putin's mental state arose during the classified briefings to lawmakers, but they were not clearly answered by the administration officials, the sources familiar with the briefings said. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who attended the Senate briefing, confirmed that Putin's mental state came up, but he declined to elaborate on what had been shared. He said, however, that regardless of the briefing, he personally is worried about Putin's mental state. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted Friday that ""it's pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin,"" hinting that his assessment was based on intelligence briefings. ""He has always been a killer, but his problem now is different & significant. It would be a mistake to assume this Putin would react the same way he would have 5 years ago."" On Sunday, Putin ordered Russia's nuclear forces into ""special combat readiness,"" a heightened alert status that the Biden administration has characterized as part of a pattern of unprovoked escalation and ""manufactured threats."" Holding back? Five days into its multipronged assault on Ukraine, Russia has suffered repeated logistical failures that defense officials and independent military analysts say are largely of its own making. Russian mechanized forces that have been the tip of the spear have often outpaced their own sustainment units carrying fuel and other supplies, leaving the support units open to ambush and stranding forward-advancing forces without fuel in the tank. ""Whether they outran [sustainment capabilities] or whether they just didn't plan properly for it, or whether they just simply didn't execute their plan for it, I don't know,"" said the senior defense official. But, ""on day 4, they're running out of gas and they've having logistics problems. Our assessment was that they did not believe they would be having those kinds of problems that early on."" Meanwhile, western officials have cheered on a better-than-anticipated showing by Ukrainian forces, in particular how effective they have been using western-provided Stinger shoulder-fired missiles and anti-aircraft artillery to take down an unknown number of Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. ""The Russians don't have complete control of the airspace of the entire country,"" said the senior western intelligence official. ""In the areas in which the Russian military operations are the most intense on the ground, those are the areas where the Russians have the most control over the airspace in terms of air to air."" But Western officials still aren't entirely sure why Russia has held back some forces outside of Ukraine's borders, or why Russia has not yet carried out the kind of electronic warfare against Ukraine the west had been anticipating -- like massive hacking campaigns and attacks on critical infrastructure. One official said the US believes Russia has been holding back on severing communications on the ground -- a tactic the west had expected early but has yet to happen -- because the Russian military forces need that infrastructure to communicate amongst themselves. As for the troops left on the border, it's possible that Russia has planned the attack in waves in an effort to exhaust the Ukrainians with the first wave and then demolish them with a second wave of fresh troops, according to two sources familiar with the intelligence. It's also possible, according to one of those sources, that Russia has simply moved cautiously after facing a tougher fight than expected. At this point, officials said, it's impossible to put a timeline on how long Ukrainian forces will be able to hold the Russians at the gates of Kyiv. ""I can't put a number [on how long Kyiv lasts],"" the senior western intelligence official said. ""I can't tell you it's going to be hours or days. ""While the Ukrainians are putting on a stiff defense, and a much better one than I think the Russians anticipated, there will be a time where they will run out of ammunition.

2022-02-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/europe/putin-stiff-opposition-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html,Vladimir Putin is facing stiffer opposition than expected -- both inside and outside Ukraine,"Five days into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it seems things haven't gone exactly to plan for Vladimir Putin so far. Western intelligence officials briefed repeatedly over the weekend that Russian forces have encountered ""stiffer than expected"" resistance from an outmanned and outgunned Ukrainian military. Russia has thus far failed to take key cities across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv. On Sunday, Ukrainian forces successfully repelled a Russian advance on a strategic airfield near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which has been under near-constant attack. In addition to a fierce fightback from Ukrainian forces and civilians, the Russian invasion has suffered logistical challenges, with soldiers on the front line running short of fuel, ammunition and food. ""They are having problems,"" a NATO official said of the Russian forces, pointing to the alliance's latest intelligence. ""They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue."" But a senior US defense official told reporters on Sunday that Russia has only used two-thirds of the total combat power applied to the mission, leaving a significant amount of forces available to press the offensive. And on Monday, a miles-long convoy of Russian military vehicles was bearing down on the Ukrainian capital, while Kyiv's intelligence also suggests Belarus is prepared to join the Russian invasion, according to a Ukrainian official. Representatives from Ukraine and Russia were meeting Monday on the Belarusian border. In those talks, Ukraine will insist on an ""immediate ceasefire"" and the withdrawal of Russian troops -- though, realistically, no one is expecting that to happen. Putin, it seems, hasn't just misjudged Ukraine's ability to defend itself, but also just how hard a line the international community would take against Russia in the event of an invasion. For years, the Russian president has faced very little pushback from the West over his illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, his brutal support for the Syrian regime and acts of aggression in other countries. For all their strong words of condemnation for Putin and his regime, Western countries still bought gas from Russia, offered a safe haven to Russian oligarchs and retained relatively normal diplomatic relations with Moscow. But this time around -- despite a few early rocky patches which saw Western nations accused of not hitting Russia hard enough -- Putin has faced an unusually united Western alliance. From unprecedented sanctions that are already hurting the Russian economy to international sport slowly turning on Moscow, Russia's international pariah status becomes more acute by the hour. The economic pain will only get worse as time goes on. The ruble lost about 20% of its value against the dollar on Monday afternoon, and Russia's central bank has raised interest rates from 9.5% to 20%, a move that will hit Russian citizens in their pockets., Those same citizens might soon wonder just why Putin is risking so much for a war that didn't need to happen. Of course, things are very fluid on the ground and could change very quickly. There's little hope that Monday's talks will yield a deescalation, and no one expects this war to end in the immediate future -- either by force or by agreement. But it's likely that Putin, having come this far, will throw more at Ukraine in the coming days. However, as the invasion enters its second week, it's impossible to ignore the fact that Putin's best-laid plans have been met with firmer resistance than he -- and many of his opponents -- ever imagined.",7,2.1659516727219676,2.302510221376675,-0.1365585486547074,6
2022-02-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-monday-intl-hnk/index.html,Russia bombs residential area of Kharkiv and intensifies Kyiv assault as talks with Ukraine end,"Russian forces bombarded a residential area in Ukraine's second-largest city with rockets on Monday, killing at least nine people, and several large detonations were heard in the center of the capital Kyiv, as talks between delegates on both sides in Belarus came to a close. The attack and explosions were launched as Russia becomes increasingly isolated from the rest of the world, particularly Western nations, which have been imposing a rash of sanctions on the country since it launched its invasion of Ukraine last week. The bombardment in the city of Kharkiv on Monday killed nine civilians, including three children, and wounded 37 others, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. CNN is reaching out to Russian authorities for comment on the attack. According to social media videos geolocated by CNN, multiple rockets were seen exploding closely together in a residential part of the Saltivka neighborhood, near a supermarket in the northeast of the city, which the Russian military has frequently targeted. Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova described the situation in Kharkiv as ""hellish"" and shared a video on Facebook of a missile that hit a kitchen window and tore off the leg of a woman, who she said later died in hospital. As talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials ended early Monday evening, CNN reporters in Kyiv heard several large detonations, followed by sirens going off across the city. Both sides discussed a potential ""ceasefire and the end of combat actions on the territory of Ukraine,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhaylo Podolyak told reporters. Without going into detail, Podolyak said that both sides would return to their capitals for consultations over whether to implement a number of ""decisions."" ""The parties discussed holding another round of negotiations where these decisions can develop,"" he said. Ukraine had earlier demanded an ""immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky's office said earlier Monday. Zelensky earlier downplayed the significance of the talks, which he is not attending in person. ""I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,"" he said Sunday. Russians face determined resistance While Ukrainians have attached little hope in the talks yielding a pathway to peace, the opportunities to deescalate the conflict appear to be quickly shrinking. Fighting has intensified in Ukraine in the past day in a number of strategic cities. A senior US defense official told reporters on Monday that taking Kharkiv ""remains an objective"" for the Russians, and ""they continue to try to advance on"" the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. But the Russians have not taken either city yet, the official said. The official explained that if Russia captures both cities ""you can see that would allow them to section off the eastern part of Ukraine,"" the official said. On Monday, CNN reporters witnessed at least three ""Uragan"" multiple rocket launchers in the Russian side of the border south of Belgorod heading towards the Kharkiv front line. They saw three launchers and a loading vehicle with missiles on it. Russia's larger and far better-equipped military has, however, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow's attempts to swiftly take control of key cities. Western allies have been increasing its assistance to Ukraine through funds and weapons to aid its defense. Ukraine said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at the city from Belarus Sunday, and claimed a successful drone attack against a Russian BUK surface-to-air missile system near the capital. But Western military assessments caution that Ukrainian forces cannot holdout indefinitely. On Monday, it appeared the the bulk of Russian ground forces were more than 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) north of Kyiv, according to an intelligence update by the the UK's Ministry of Defense. The advance of those troops was slowed by stiff Ukrainian resistance at the nearby Hostomel airfield, ""a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict,"" the ministry said. The Russian military announced what it described as an ""open and safe"" corridor for civilians to leave the capital on Monday, while repeating a baseless claim that the Ukrainian government was using residents as a ""human shield."" And while Ukrainian troops appear to be holding ground in the country's north, Russian forces have made some advances to the south. On Sunday Russian troops took control of Berdyansk -- a port city of 100,000 people on Ukraine's southern coast, and the site of a small naval base. The ongoing Russian assault has inflicted widespread suffering and casualties on the Ukrainian population. More than half a million refugees have fled Ukraine to neigboring countries, according to the UN's refugee agency. The number of known civilians killed in Ukraine stands at 352, with 14 of those children, Ukraine's Ministry of Interior said Sunday. Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces accused Russia of hitting civilian areas. ""In violation of the norms of international humanitarian law, the occupiers have insidiously inflicted missile strikes on residential buildings in Zhytomir and Chernyhiv,"" a statement said on Monday. CNN is unable to independently verify these claims. Concerns over nuclear confrontation Pressure is intensifying on the Kremlin as Western allies of Ukraine try to prop up the country with weapons and as Russia faces financial turmoil, with the ruble in free fall. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday raised the stakes by ordering his country's nuclear forces to be placed on high alert. Later on Sunday, Belarus renounced its non-nuclear status in a referendum, after the former Soviet nation became a launch pad for Russia's invasion in Ukraine last week. The vote in favor of a new constitution could theoretically allow Russia to place nuclear weapons back in Belarus for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, when Belarus gave up its stockpile and became a nuclear free zone. Addressing journalists at a polling station in Minsk, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said he could ask Putin to ""return the nuclear weapons"" Belarus gave away if the West transferred any nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania. Ukrainian intelligence also indicated Belarus could be preparing to ""participate directly"" in the invasion of Ukraine, according to two sources close to the Ukrainian government. Lukashenko said last week that Belarusian troops could join the invasion ""if it becomes necessary."" Meanwhile, the UK said it will provide an additional $53 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and British leaders plan to introduce legislation in Parliament aimed at clamping down on Russian money laundering and fraud. And Australian travel bans and targeted financial sanctions against Putin and senior members of his government went into effect Monday, the country's Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed in a statement. South Korea and Singapore on Monday also announced new sanctions on Russia.",47,1.6566063976129095,1.521350229241616,0.13525616837129362,25
2022-02-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/europe/kharkiv-street-fight-russia-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html,One battle in Kharkiv shows how Ukraine is fighting back against the Russian invasion,"Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, is believed to have been one of the invading Russian military's first strategic targets. Home to 1.4 million people, it is located less than 20 miles from the Russian border, in northeast Ukraine. It was approached by Russian troops shortly after the invasion began last Thursday, but for three days, Ukrainian forces held the Russians at bay. Then, on Sunday, Russian troops entered the city according to the region's governor, Oleh Synehubov. What happened next offers clues to the fierce resistance Russian soldiers are meeting in Ukraine's towns and cities -- and to why they have not yet advanced as quickly as experts initially feared they would. ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine are eliminating the enemy,"" Synehubov reassured the residents of Kharkiv that day. Videos uploaded to social media give a rare glimpse of the clashes on the city's streets. One sequence of videos uploaded to social media show an attempt by a Russian unit to advance towards an important airfield and arms factory in the northeast of Kharkiv. The airfield, at the Kharkiv State Aircraft Manufacturing Company, is small -- just a single runway -- but might be a useful bridgehead for the Russians. CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the videos. The first video, taken by a resident, shows a convoy of Russian troops surrounding military vehicles, creeping along a roadway that ends near the airfield. ""There are two [military vehicles] as far as I can see,"" someone says in the video. ""A third one is crawling through with infantry with automatic weapons, getting ready."" Suddenly, gunfire is heard and seen. A Russian soldier kneels quickly and fires a shoulder-launched rocket towards the area where the gunfire appears to be coming from. A second video, taken after the firefight, shows the military vehicles reversing in an apparent retreat. The Russian troops are seen huddled behind their vehicles. A Reuters journalist who went to the location after the firefight shot video showing one of the Russian vehicles from the military convoy abandoned and a significant amount of blood staining the snow on the ground nearby. The Reuters journalist spoke with a resident, identified as Yevgeniy, who told them that at least one Russian soldier had been killed there. ""After we've killed this one the others run away,"" Yevgeniy told Reuters, pointing to a patch of blood in the snow. He tells the journalist there were between 12 and 15 people in the group. ""They won't take Kharkiv,"" he insists. ""They have run back to where they came from. They don't have good navigation you see. Nothing works for them. They came and were hiding behind the houses."" The troops' efforts to retreat appear to have been stopped by another attack. A convoy of vehicles -- of the same type as those seen in the previous clips -- is seen on fire in another video. ""This is how we greet the b*tch Russian army,"" someone is heard shouting in the video. ""Come here and blindfold him. And this will happen to anyone who comes to us here on Kharkiv soil."" It's not possible to say definitively that the Russian trucks seen on fire are the same as those filmed trying to reach the airport, but they are in the same location, are the same type, and bear the same markings. Another video apparently taken later at the site of the abandoned military convoy -- the vehicles are no longer on fire -- shows Ukrainian troops engaging. Amid the firefight, a Ukrainian soldier steps out from the wall and is seen firing a shoulder-launched rocket. Watching the video, retired Gen. Mark Hertling, national security and military analyst for CNN, said the Ukrainian unit was equipped with rocket-propelled grenades. ""You see that force, that small squad there of about 10 guys, the guy up furthest away from us is repeatedly firing rocket-propelled grenades, he's fired by my count about five of them, he is handing off the launcher to another guy, they are reloading and he is ready to shoot again,"" he said. ""And everybody else, you look at the cool, calm, collected approach by these soldiers under fire, they're not afraid, they're ready to kick some butt,"" he added. Later, another video shows Ukrainian troops around the convoy, appearing to rummage through the abandoned vehicles. Sporadic gunfire is heard and some Ukrainian forces move along a wall in the background. ""Slava Ukraini,"" says someone in the video (""glory to Ukraine""). Swift response But on Monday, Russian troops returned to the northeastern suburbs of Kharkiv and renewed their attack on the city. Multiple social media videos geolocated by CNN show rockets exploding closely together in a residential area of the Saltivka neighborhood, close to a supermarket. One showed a rocket booster lodged in the street pavement, as civilians looked on. ""It's more hellish in Kharkiv today than it was yesterday,"" said Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova, posting on Facebook. According to Kharkiv City Council, the latest shelling left one female civilian dead, and 31 people -- 15 servicemen and 16 civilians -- wounded. In recent days, the city council has recorded seven fatalities -- two servicemen and five civilians -- and 44 wounded, including 20 servicemen. ""Kharkiv has just been subjected to massive Grad shelling! Dozens of victims,"" Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs, said Monday describing the situation there as ""a nightmare."" Russia maintains that it does not target civilians.",47,1.490274056336364,1.6473800970131538,-0.1571060406767899,27
2022-02-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html,Ukraine-Russia delegations to meet for talks Monday,"A Ukrainian delegation will meet with a Russian delegation on Monday for talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border following assurances from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. The announcement came Sunday as Ukrainian forces engaged in fierce fighting with Russian troops in multiple cities across Ukraine. Russia is facing universal condemnation and increased sanctions from Western powers over Moscow's unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day. Ukraine's Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin said the talks would take place Monday morning local time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he would be willing to hold talks with Russia but not in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country. On Sunday, Zelensky said in a brief televised statement that he doesn't expect much from the meeting. ""I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,"" Zelensky said. Ukraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Zelensky's office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. ""The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,"" Zelensky's office said. ""Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation's travel, meeting and return."" Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country's deterrence forces -- which include nuclear arms -- onto their highest state of alert on Sunday. ""Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,"" Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials. Putin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful. A senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin's latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression. ""The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,"" said the official. ""This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step."" As the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin's order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a ""direct threat to us"" and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday's scheduled talks. Kuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to ""listen to what Russia has to say"" but will not give in to pressure. ""We will tell them what we think of this,"" he said. ""And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop."" Kuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin's inner circle do not agree with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ""because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself."" Fighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv Earlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight. And fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. ""Do not leave your shelters!"" he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets. ""Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,"" an assessment by the UK's Ministry of Defence said. Ukrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city -- home to about 1.4 million people -- for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began. But despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families. Others are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations ""reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed"" in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added. In a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict. The Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: ""The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians."" But Zelensky rejected this, saying: ""They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure."" Ukraine is ""documenting their crimes,"" he said, adding: ""This is terror."" Russian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia's offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and ""buses with children"" -- actions he labeled as ""war crimes."" ""The Russian government doesn't understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,"" he added. Russian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain's Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize ""the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,"" another British assessment said Sunday. Russia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN. The US continues to see Russian forces facing ""stiff resistance"" and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues. The official noted that the Russians are having a ""little bit more success"" in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them. Ukrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this. On Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion. ""Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. ""Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades."" Without providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were ""considerably lower"" than those by Ukrainian forces. Russia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air. So far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine's border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces -- despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion. A NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems. ""They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,"" said the official. Asked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. ""They are way behind schedule,"" the official said. ""This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful."" But the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk ""were completely blocked"" by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured. CNN could not immediately verify those claims. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult. Accusations of war crimes Concerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces. A CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon. Thermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations. There is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine. Although Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.

2022-02-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/politics/russian-ukraine-resistance/index.html,"Russian invasion runs into stiff resistance, supply lines are a 'definite vulnerability,' US officials say","Russia's invasion of Ukraine is encountering ""stiffer than expected"" resistance from the Ukrainian military as well as unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge tell CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated. In addition, Russia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, a senior dedfense official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. ""Ukrainian air defenses, including aircraft, do continue to be operable and continue to engage and deny access to Russian aircraft in places over the country,"" the official said. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air. Together, these challenges have so far prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine's border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces, which officials worried could happen on the first night of an invasion. Officials caution that this picture of the battlefield is just a moment in time, and the situation on the ground could change very quickly as Russian forces keep up their assault. These officials noted that Russian forces still greatly outnumber Ukrainian forces, and Russia continues to maneuver these forces into position around major urban centers. It's also unclear how much of the slower movement can be attributed to the logistical challenge of moving such a large force. The Ukrainian military has a number of different anti-aircraft weapons, including radar-guided and heat-seeking missiles, as well as anti-aircraft guns, according to IHS Janes. The US has also provided the Ukrainian military with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles in recent weeks, as have other NATO allies. As of Saturday evening in Ukraine, the US had not seen any indication that the Russian military has taken control over any Ukrainian cities, the official said, even as Russian forces have moved to surround some population centers, including Kyiv. Keeping Russia's large invasion force supplied with fuel and ammunition has also proved difficult. As one senior US official explained, Russia anticipated a fast victory and may have neglected to plan for sufficient resupply of its forces. Supply lines, this official explained, are a ""definite vulnerability."" ""What we assess now is that he had to commit a bit more logistics and sustainment, in fuel specifically, than what we believe they had planned to do this early in the operation,"" said one of the officials. Russia's forces launched their invasion of Ukraine early Thursday morning, with missiles landing in cities across the country. US officials have said Moscow's goal is to take Kyiv and ""decapitate"" the government led by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky turned down an offer from the US to evacuate from Kyiv, the Ukraine Embassy in Britain wrote Saturday on Twitter. Zelensky has posted videos on social media showing he's remained in Ukraine. ""The world has seen that Ukrainians are powerful, Ukrainians are courageous, they're on their native land, and they're never going to give it up to anyone. They will never betray it,"" he said in an address Saturday. Russia has spun their slow advance in Ukraine as a stop to allow time for negotiations, not a military setback. On Saturday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said its troops have been ordered to resume their offensive ""in all directions,"" after a suspension was ordered for negotiations with the Ukrainian government. The ministry said the offensive was ordered to continue after Ukraine abandoned the consultations. A Ukrainian presidential adviser denied in the early hours Saturday that Ukraine had refused to negotiate. ""They are having problems,"" a NATO official said of the Russian forces, pointing to the alliance's latest intelligence. ""They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue."" Asked whether the Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. ""They are way behind schedule,"" the official said. ""This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful."" Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who has also remained in Kyiv, said in an interview Saturday on CNN that the Ukrainian military has displayed ""exceptional heroism"" but that the country still needs more help from its allies in receiving weapons like anti-tank missiles.",7,2.3878202700443474,3.274313202545366,-0.8864929325010187,25
2022-02-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/politics/ukraine-malware-warning-cybersecurity-fbi-cisa/index.html,"US firms should be wary of destructive malware unleashed on Ukraine, FBI and CISA warn","US critical infrastructure firms should reinforce their defenses and increase their vigilance following data-destroying cyberattacks in Ukraine prior to a large-scale Russian attack on the country, the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Saturday. ""Destructive malware can present a direct threat to an organization's daily operations, impacting the availability of critical assets and data,"" the US agencies said in a public advisory. ""Further disruptive cyberattacks against organizations in Ukraine are likely to occur and may unintentionally spill over to organizations in other countries."" The advisory includes several technical recommendations for organizations to keep malicious software from spreading on their systems. US officials continue to say there are ""no specific, credible"" threats to the US homeland tied to tensions with Russia over Ukraine, but Saturday's advisory is the latest warning from officials that what happens in cyberspace in Ukraine may not stay there. Just hours before Russian forces began to attack Ukraine early Thursday, cybersecurity researchers said they had found a data-wiping hacking tool on hundreds of computers belonging to the Ukrainian government and financial organizations. The malicious code is designed to delete data from computers and render them inoperable — which has the potential to hobble organizations trying to stay online during a war. Jean-Ian Boutin, head of threat research at anti-virus firm ESET, which responded to some of the destructive hacks, told CNN that he assumed that the malware was successfully deployed and the ""affected machines were wiped."" Two Ukrainian government contractors — one with a presence in Latvia and another with a presence in Lithuania (both NATO members) — were hit with the malware, according to Broadcom's cybersecurity unit Symantec. While the hack was targeted at Ukrainian assets, the potential for collateral damage in cyberspace during the war in Ukraine has been high on Western officials' minds. It's unclear who was responsible for deploying the destructive malware. It was the second such destructive hack in as many months. A similar piece of malicious code appeared on the systems of some Ukrainian government agencies and nonprofit and technology organizations in January. The White House has blamed Russia's GRU military intelligence agency for a separate cyberattack on Ukrainian government websites on February 15 that temporarily knocked the websites offline. Russia has denied the allegation. In a statement Saturday, CISA Director Jen Easterly said her agency has been working ""with our partners to identify and rapidly share information about malware that could threaten the operations of critical infrastructure here in the U.S.""",20,8.879680611768858,7.525936186968218,1.3537444248006398,2

The latest development comes after Ukraine's outgunned forces held the capital for the third day on Saturday as battles continued across the country, while a defiant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told citizens to defend the country. A blast lit up the skyline on Saturday night in the strategic maritime city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine as heavy shelling reverberated around its outskirts. The sound of small arms fire and the impact of multiple rockets punctuated the night following a day of heightened tension in the city. A CNN crew saw Ukrainian troops fire warning shots and throw suspected Russian saboteurs from their cars to the ground. After unconfirmed reports of Russian paratroopers landing in the city's northern areas, a bridge was raised for the first time in years in a bid to cut a main connection between the north and south of the city -- which sits on an inlet from the Black Sea. As Russia's war of aggression moves to the streets of multiple Ukrainian cities, with Ukraine's outnumbered military continuing to hold back the invading forces in multiple locations, the Russian Ministry of Defense said its troops have been ordered to resume their offensive ""in all directions."" Ukraine's prime minister announced the country was closing its borders with Russia and Belarus beginning Monday, and only Ukrainian citizens would be able to cross into Ukraine from those two countries. A senior US defense official warned Saturday that more than half of Russian President Vladimir Putin's assembled power was ""now committed inside Ukraine."" Heavy fighting was ongoing in the northern city of Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border, while there was ""less resistance in the south,"" a US official said. In Vasilkiv, a town some 35 kilometers south of Kyiv, the mayor said Saturday morning that fierce fighting was taking place in the middle of the town. Vasilkiv Mayor Natalia Balasynovich said there were losses on the Ukrainian side with ""many wounded, unfortunately, they are in the 200s,"" she told the Ukrainian parliament channel Saturday. But Russia's invasion has not progressed as fast as Moscow would have expected, say Western intelligence officials. Britain's Ministry of Defense said Russia has yet to gain control of Ukrainian airspace ""greatly reducing the effectiveness of the Russian Air Force."" Russia has also faced ""acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance,"" slowing the speed of the Russian advance, the UK ministry said in a Saturday intelligence update shared on Twitter. But it stressed that the bulk of Russian forces are now only 18.6 miles from the center of Kyiv, warning that casualties are ""likely to be heavy and greater than anticipated or acknowledged by the Kremlin."" Despite being a prime target in the invasion, Zelensky turned down a US offer of evacuation, the Ukraine Embassy in Britain said Saturday on Twitter. ""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,"" Zelensky told the US, according to the embassy. Zelensky echoed the resolve of many Ukrainians -- some of whom have taken arms -- in a video message Saturday afternoon. ""We have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks. Fighting continues in different cities and regions of our country,"" he said. ""Each Ukrainian should keep one thing in mind: if you can stop and destroy the occupiers -- do it. Everyone who can come back to Ukraine -- come back to defend Ukraine,"" he said. Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, braced for a further night of fighting, imposing a curfew on the city, from 5 p.m. local (10 a.m. ET) to 8 a.m., beginning Saturday evening. He warned that civilians on the street after curfew will be considered ""members of the enemy's sabotage and reconnaissance groups."" The resistance to Russia's invasion has seen civilians prepare to defend their capital in recent days, with officials arming reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone and Ukrainian TV broadcasting instructions for making Molotov cocktails. In the northern city of Bakhmach, Ukrainian citizens attempted to stop Russian tanks by standing in front of them, according to videos seen by CNN. A Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher has been spotted by a CNN team south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon. The TOS-1 or TOS-1A Multiple Rocket Launcher seen by CNN is capable of launching rockets with thermobaric warheads. There is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine. These types of weapons do not use conventional ammunition. Instead, they are filled with high-temperature, high-pressure explosive. They are sometimes called ""vacuum bombs"" because they suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects. Early Saturday, a large residential apartment block in the west of Kyiv was struck by a missile or rocket, as residents across the city were forced to seek shelter after a terrifying night of fighting. Images and video from the scene showed a large impact some ten floors up in the building, with the cause of the strike unclear and the extent of casualties unknown. Several apartment units were blown out entirely, their outer walls and windows missing, leaving a gaping hole visible in the building's side, as residents were evacuated Ukrainian troops are fighting against a significantly more advanced military power. Russian defense spending is roughly ten times that of Kyiv's and its armed forces stand at some 900,000 active personnel and 2 million in reserve, versus Ukraine's 196,000 and 900,000 reservists. The Russian Defense Ministry has not reported a single combat casualty from the invasion, a CNN review of their news releases shows. But Zelensky has claimed that the country's forces have killed ""hundreds"" of Russian soldiers, without providing an exact figure. On Friday morning, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said Russia had lost more than 450 personnel. Ukrainian officials have acknowledged casualties on their side. CNN has been unable to independently verify casualty figures. Room for diplomacy? There have been suggestions of efforts toward diplomacy to stop the bloodshed, with Zelensky's senior adviser, Myhailo Podoliak, on Saturday morning saying Ukraine would set conditions in any process, noting he didn't think the country had ""weak positions."" A separate spokesperson for Zelensky, Sergii Nykyforov, late Friday said that Ukraine ""has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace."" Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a halt Friday to the Russian military's advance in Ukraine pending negotiations, but operations resumed after the government in Kyiv allegedly refused talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Saturday. Zelensky spokesperson Nykyforov had previously denied any ""claims that we have refused to negotiate."" ""The sooner negotiations begin, the better the chances of resuming normal life,"" he said. Western officials have been examining whether Zelensky could form a government in exile if he were to flee Kyiv, US officials told CNN. But those officials and a source close to Zelensky said the Ukrainian president has rebuffed those offers. The Russian Ministry of Defense in a statement Saturday, claimed to have taken control over the city of Melitopol in southeastern Ukraine. This comes after a massive explosion at Melitopol Airport was captured in footage shared on social media. Russia also launched cruise missile strikes overnight against targets in Ukraine. There have been reports of apartment buildings and kindergartens being shelled, civilians being killed, and rockets being found in residential streets since the beginning of the invasion earlier this week. Images analyzed by CNN confirmed that on several occasions densely populated areas have been hit by Russian forces around the country. Russia's invasion has been followed by sweeping sanctions by Western nations, designed to damage Russia's economy and turn Putin into an international ""pariah."" The White House, along with France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada, announced Saturday evening that they would expel certain Russian banks from SWIFT, the high-security network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world, pledging to ""collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin."" ""This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,"" they wrote in a joint statement released by the White House, also pledging ""restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions,"" and restricting the sale of ""golden passports"" that allow Russian oligarchs to avoid the brunt of sanctions already levied. Russia's decision to invade Ukraine has seen its allies like China struggle to balance its close strategic partnership with Moscow with its seemingly contradictory policy of supporting state sovereignty. China, which has declined to criticize Russia's attack, abstained on voting for a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Humanitarian crisis While the previous two nights in Kyiv were marked by the sounds of sporadic explosions coming from further away, Friday night in the capital was different for the residents who remained, with bursts of small arms fire and visible orange lines of fire going up into the sky. Streets around the city center were also empty, with many who remained spending the night in subway stations and underground garages, seeking safe haven. One Kyiv resident who gave her name as Olga said she had her young son Vadim, a kindergartener, sleeping in the bathroom. ""We are not going to the shelter, it does not guarantee 100% safety, and it can affect the psychology of a child. At home, he sleeps well, eats and thinks it's all fun,"" she said. An unknown number of Kyiv's residents had already left the capital by Friday, leaving quiet the roads heading west of the capital that had been busy on Thursday. Refugees have been pouring into neighboring European countries in recent days, with international leaders warning of a humanitarian crisis. Kelly Clements, the deputy high commissioner of the UN's refugee agency, told CNN more than 120,000 Ukrainians have fled Ukraine while 850,000 are internally displaced. Up to 4 million Ukrainians could flee if things continued to deteriorate",47,3.360373619905067,1.386006974585995,1.9743666453190718,25
2022-02-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/europe/ukraine-russia-videos-civilians-intl-cmd/index.html,Russia says it's not hitting Ukraine's civilian infrastructure. Evidence suggests otherwise,"On Friday, Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov sought to reassure the world about civilian casualties on day two of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine,"" he said during a heated press conference, telling CNN that there were ""no strikes on civilian infrastructure."" However, reports about apartment buildings and kindergartens being shelled, civilians being killed, and rockets being found in residential streets have been trickling in since the beginning of the offensive. Social media videos, photos and satellite images analyzed and geolocated by CNN confirm that on several occasions densely populated areas have been hit by Russian forces. CNN is reaching out to the Russian government for comment. Amnesty International, in a press release on Friday, accused Russian forces of ""indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and strikes on protected objects such as hospitals,"" citing three examples, including an attack on Thursday near a hospital building in Vuhledar, in the eastern Donetsk region. That attack killed four civilians and wounded ten more, Amnesty reported. Here are some examples CNN found. Kindergarten in Okhtyrka, orphanage in Vorzel A kindergarten in Okhtyrka, in the north-eastern region of Sumy, was hit by shelling on Friday, according to several public officials. The mayor Pavel Kuzmenko, claimed the shelling was carried out by a Russian Uragan multiple launch rocket system, injuring several children. News of the alleged attack on Sonechko kindergarten was confirmed by the Head of the Sumy Regional Military Administration Dmytro Zhivitsky who said this was the third shelling in Okhtyrka on Friday. A video circulating on social media which CNN geolocated to the kindergarten in Okhtyrka shows injured people covered in blood on the ground in front of the entrance. In the aftermath of the alleged attack, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused the Russian Federation of ""war crimes."" ""Today's Russian attacks on a kindergarten and an orphanage are war crimes and violations of the Rome Statute,"" Kuleba tweeted. ""Together with the General Prosecutor's Office we are collecting this and other facts, which we will immediately send to the Hague. Responsibility is inevitable,"" he added. The orphanage was also mentioned by Lyudmila Denisova, the ombudsman of the Verkhovna Rada for Human Rights. ""As a result of heavy armor shelling of an orphanage in the town of Vorzel in the Kyiv region, 51 children are currently at risk of life and health, 3 of whom have severe health problems and 15 infants. Two buildings of the institution were damaged,"" she said. Rockets in Bucha and Kharkiv A video appeared on Facebook on Friday showing a projectile hitting the tarmac on a residential road. The user posting it then attached a photo of a remnant in hand with the words ""the fragment is on our doorstep."" CNN geolocated the video to a residential address in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv. Experts and open source analysts are debating whether the rocket contained a cluster munition based on the footage. Mark Hiznay, associate director of the arms division at Human Rights Watch told CNN the projectile is a cluster munition. Upon landing, the munition ""will impact a wide area,"" Hiznay explained and ""send out 9mm bullets all over the place. Pretty nasty."" Another explosive also landed in a residential area in Kharkiv, a city in northeast Ukraine. One image circulating on social media showed a large projectile that had ploughed through a pedestrian crossing. CNN geolocated the image to Kharkiv. Hiznay identified the weapon as a motor for a Smerch rocket and said it was likely no longer dangerous. Chuhuiv apartment building An apartment block in the eastern city of Chuhuiv, outside Kharkiv, was damaged in an attack on Thursday that Ukrainian officials attributed to Russian forces. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry listed Chuhuiv as one of the targets of the intensive shelling and strikes on the first day of the Russian offensive. Maxar released new imagery of a nearby airport that was the likely target of the attack. In the images, it is possible to see damage to fuel storage areas and other airport infrastructure. News agencies such as Agence France-Presse and Anadolu released images that showed a resident of the Chuhuiv apartment building crying among the wreckage of the strike, an old woman wrapped in a blanket sitting outside and firefighters attending a fire inside the building. At least one victim could be seen lying on the ground. Photos also showed a single large crater in the ground which hints at the use of a single missile or rocket for the attack, Amnesty said. CNN has geolocated the site of the attack.",47,4.237591976600416,2.4961877011985885,1.7414042754018273,27
2022-02-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-friday-intl-hnk/index.html,Battle for Ukrainian capital underway as explosions seen and heard in Kyiv,"Explosions have been seen and heard in parts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as the fight by Ukrainian forces to hold back a Russian advance on the capital intensifies in the early hours of Saturday morning, amid warnings the city could fall within days and as officials handed out weapons to reservists. ""This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a late-night video message Friday. ""This night we have to stand ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now."" Earlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area. CNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well -- as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv. ""Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,"" the armed forces said. Russian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But ""Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,"" he said. Russia's military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a ""successful landing operation"" to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv's outskirts. Zelensky's comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, ""We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine."" Before dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later. ""Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,"" Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire. LIVE UPDATES ON INVASION A tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: ""Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier."" CNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition -- apparently heading towards Obolon. Meanwhile, 92 people working at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world's worst-ever nuclear disaster, have been taken hostage, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said Friday. Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities. As Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence. However, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made ""limited progress"" Friday in its attack. ""Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,"" the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted. A senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have ""about a third of their combat power"" in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country's borders right now, but ""that does not mean that they will not commit more."" The Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million. For now, Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that ""enemy sabotage groups"" had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" he said. ""Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,"" he said. ""Such attacks on our capital haven't occurred since 1941."" In an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were ""showing their true heroism"" but that they were defending their country ""alone."" The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are ""not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,"" he said. A few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. ""There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let's sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people's deaths,"" he said, speaking in Russian. Shortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported. ""As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,"" Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern ""neutral status,"" he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact. Zelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees. ""Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,"" Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called ""claims that we have refused to negotiate."" Meanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine's armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday. ""Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,"" Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. ""Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people."" Putin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a ""Nazi"" or ""fascist"" regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish. Asked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow's plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: ""Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine."" In an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being ""simply crazy"" in wanting to ""come here to kill Ukrainians"" -- and vowed they would resist. ""We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,"" he said. Homes damaged The advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions -- and questions about Putin's wider ambitions for the country and its capital. It's unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power. Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured. Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet. Separately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city. As they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way. Outside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south. A CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back. Low-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city. A Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a ""counter-offensive"" was underway in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims. Makeshift bunkers Officials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government. Those fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he's ""convinced"" Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government. If that happens, Blinken said he believes ""Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses -- and potentially worse -- on the Ukrainian people."" The fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties a",47,1.0963587232336016,2.7788750788526446,-1.682516355619043,25

The sources said that the initial US assessment from before the invasion -- which anticipated that the Ukrainian capital would be overrun within one to four days of a Russian attack -- remains the current expectation. Russian forces have moved to within 20 miles of Kyiv, senior administration officials told lawmakers on Capitol Hill Thursday night. Officials believe Russia has been facing stiffer resistance from Ukrainian forces than it anticipated, according to the sources. But the officials in that briefing to Capitol Hill declined to say whether they believed Kyiv would fall. Western intelligence officials assess that Russia's plan is to topple the government in Kyiv and install a Russia-friendly proxy government, but they don't yet know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will seek to occupy and hold Ukrainian territory afterwards, one of the sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN. Ukrainian officials have vowed to resist any occupation. Ukrainians in Kyiv huddled in air raid shelters Friday morning as a battle for the city raged overhead and Ukrainian forces sought to hold back rapidly advancing Russian troops by blowing up a key bridge.

2022-02-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/europe/russia-ukraine-military-comparison-intl/index.html,Ukraine and Russia's militaries are David and Goliath. Here's how they compare,"Heavily armed Russian troops are pushing rapidly towards Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, and US officials are warning the city could fall within days. The military capabilities of these two nations are so imbalanced that Ukraine's defiant president, Volodymyr Zelensky, implored his Western allies overnight to do more than impose sanctions to get Russian troops off Ukrainian soil. Here's how the two country's military capabilities stack up. Defense spending Just a look at the amount of money the two nations spend on defense gives an indication of the gap between the two. Ukraine spent $4.7 billion in 2021, just over a tenth of nuclear-armed Russia's $45.8 billion, according to ""The Military Balance"" report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), published last week. While the Russian government launched a drive in 2008 to modernize its military, after a brief war with Georgia laid bare equipment shortfalls, Ukraine's weapons are still largely from the Soviet era. In its ambitions to join NATO, however, Ukraine has reorganized the structure of its armed forces, and has plans to re-equip its air force with Western combat aircraft by the mid-2030s. It also plans to improve its naval capability. Manpower Where Russia has 900,000 active personnel in its armed forces, and 2 million in reserve, Ukraine has 196,000 and 900,000 reservists. Ukraine on Wednesday began conscripting reservists aged 18-60, according to IISS. In land forces alone, Russia has a twofold advantage, with 280,000 troops to Ukraine's 125,600. And its air force is nearly five times as strong, with 165,00 to Ukraine's 35,000. But in terms of how many troops are in this particular operation, Yohann Michel, a research analyst who worked on the IISS report, said Russia had an estimated 200,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. ""That's including around 60 battle groups. The situation is evolving rapidly and that number could change, but it's very large, and that's important. It's one of the largest in eastern Europe that we've seen in years -- in my lifetime,"" Michel told CNN. ""Ukrainian numbers are more difficult because everything they have is now mobilized and they have called in reservists."" Weaponry and vehicles There is a lot to compare here -- attack aircraft, armored vehicles, surface-to-air missiles -- but in general, Russia simply has more of everything. Russia has more than 15,857 armored fighting vehicles, for example, to Ukraine's 3,309. It has more than 10 times the aircraft -- 1,391 to Ukraine's 128, and 821 helicopters to Ukraine's 55, if you include Navy aircraft. And where Russia has 49 submarines, Ukraine has none, according to IISS. ""There are big difference between the two forces -- Russia has a much more capable air domain, its air defenses are stronger,"" Michel said. ""There is a huge difference on helicopters and planes available at every level -- from transport aircraft to fighter aircraft to attack helicopters."" Combat will Ukrainian forces have, however, launched some successful counterattacks. Michel notes that the sheer combat will among Ukrainian troops to fight has been the armed forces' greatest strength. ""I'm really surprised at what I'm seeing. The fact that Ukrainian fighter jets are still flying, they actually took off is impressive."" If Russia takes the capital soon, it will be difficult for Ukraine to fight back. But if it is unsuccessful, the conflict could become protracted. And that's the scenario where Ukraine's will may prove a powerful weapon, Michel said. Modernization But with fighting going on across the country, the number and quality of armory is a major factor. Nick Reynolds, a Research Analyst for Land Warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, said that Ukraine's air force was now largely knocked out. ""There have been serious issues with modernization due to Ukraine's economic problems since 2014, so the military lacks modern air defense and artillery, particularly counter-battery artillery radar and other surveillance equipment to detect enemy artillery and at least stand some chance of suppressing it with their own,"" Reynolds told CNN. ""These capabilities are critical for Ukraine's army to be able to maneuver and resupply itself.""",7,4.031031260513529,4.297519192435827,-0.26648793192229814,23

Ukrainian ministers said the Kremlin had begun a ""full-scale invasion"" of their country, and the fighting appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Markets across the globe plunged. LIVE UPDATES ON INVASION Attacks and explosions have been reported throughout Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, where air sirens rang out Thursday morning and afternoon. Russian forces appeared to be encircling the city and looked poised to invade, Ukraine's deputy interior minister told CNN. Officials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government. In a video statement late Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky said he believes ""enemy sabotage groups"" had entered Kyiv and that he was their No. 1 target. His family, he said, was the second target. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" he said, adding he was staying in the government quarter. Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact, but has declared state of emergency that will begin Friday. In an emotional speech Thursday afternoon, Zelensky called on world leaders for support, warning that if Ukraine doesn't get help now, ""war will come knocking at your door tomorrow."" According to preliminary figures, 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed since the invasion began early Thursday, Zelensky said, with another 316 soldiers wounded. In a declaration signed late Thursday, Zelensky ordered a general military mobilization ""in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations."" At the same time, the country barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service. Western leaders were united in their swift and strong condemnation of Russia's military action. US President Joe Biden said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""committed an assault on the very principles that uphold the global peace."" ""Now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin allies are really all about,"" Biden said Biden announced a raft of new sanctions to punish Moscow, some of which limit Russia's ability to do business using important global currencies such as the dollar and the euro and target Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets. ""Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,"" said Biden. Speaking in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a ""brutal act of war"" and said it put ""countless innocent lives"" at risk. ""Peace on our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on the scale and of the type we thought belonged to history,"" he said. ""NATO allies condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. It is a blatant violation of international law, an act of aggression against a sovereign independent and peaceful country."" NATO will increase land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank, the security alliance said in a statement. Russians give their rationale for invasion Putin had kept the international community on a knife's edge for months, as the world watched and waited to see what exactly the Kremlin planned to do with the estimated 150,000 troops it deployed on Ukraine's borders. After repeatedly denying any plans to invade Ukraine, Putin said in a televised address early Thursday that Russia would be conducting a military operation in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which contains Donetsk and Luhansk, the separatist-held regions that Moscow recognized as independent on Monday -- in violation of international law. Putin said earlier this week he was ordering troops to the breakaway enclaves to act as ""peacekeepers."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told foreign journalists that the ""demilitarization and denazification"" of Ukraine are among the objectives of Russia's military action in the country. ""Ideally, Ukraine should be liberated, cleansed of Nazis, of pro-Nazi people and ideology,"" Peskov said, though he refused to say if that meant regime change in Kyiv. The Russian claim of a need to ""denazify"" Ukraine is one Putin has touted repeatedly over the years and is baseless. Zelensky, the Ukrainian President, is Jewish. The Russian strongman urged Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home, saying all responsibility for possible bloodshed would be entirely on the conscience of the Ukrainian government. ""Our plans are not to occupy Ukraine, we do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,"" he said, but threatened ""those who may be tempted to intervene"" on Ukraine's behalf. ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never experienced in your history,"" he said. Invasion launched before dawn The first blasts were heard at around 5 a.m. local time Thursday, and it quickly became clear that Moscow's military assault was not limited to eastern Ukraine. CNN teams on the ground heard explosions in and near multiple Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv; the second-largest city, Kharkiv; Odessa; and distant firing from Zaporizhzhiya. Ukrainian officials said on social media that Russia was staging attacks far and wide, shelling control centers such as airfields and military headquarters in Kyiv and Kharkiv. The Russian military has, according to a senior US defense official, been targeting ""military and air defense"" targets, meaning ""barracks, ammunition warehouses, nearly 10 airfields,"" the official said. Images released by Zelensky's office showed large explosions to the east of Kyiv with huge columns of smoke rising into the air. At least seven people were killed and 17 were wounded in a missile attack on a military area northeast of the capital, Ukrainian authorities said. Zelensky said Ukrainian forces were doing ""exceptionally"" in the Donbas region, and while Russian troops were slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region in Ukraine's north, Ukrainian defenses were holding elsewhere. Russian forces did seize the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the scene of Europe's worst nuclear disaster. Ukraine's borders were reportedly under attack from Russian forces to the north in Belarus and the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. The Russian military claimed Ukraine's border service ""did not provide any resistance"" and claimed to have ""suppressed"" Ukraine's air defenses. CNN was not able to immediately verify either of those claims. Three military facilities in the western Lviv region were attacked, according to the regional governor. Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN that Ukrainian troops had retreated from ""fierce fighting"" with Russian forces for control of the strategic Antonov air base on the outskirts of the Kyiv but were staging a counterattack. Earlier Thursday, large numbers of helicopters dropped Russian troops at the air base to secure it, he said. A CNN team spoke with Russian airborne troops on the perimeter of the air base, only about 20 miles from the heart of the capital, and heard exchanges of fire with Ukrainian forces. Civilians hide in subway stations amid fighting The violence near the capital forced families to crowd into subway stations, as city authorities issued an air raid warning and urged residents to seek shelter underground. Across the country, Ukraine's subway stations are doubling as bomb shelters, as the assault continues and fears of strikes grow. Heavy traffic could be seen clogging roads heading west out of the capital as dawn broke, while further east, near the Russian border, the mayor of Kharkiv urged citizens not to leave their homes. Ukrainians have largely remained divided about the possibility of a Russian invasion, hoping that the military buildup was just the latest in Moscow's mind games. After months of ratcheting up tensions, the wide-scale military assault still came as a shock -- especially in Kyiv, where residents had, until Wednesday, continued to go about their daily lives as foreign governments withdrew their diplomatic staff from the capital. ""You wake up at 5 a.m. to a totally new reality, and you find out the world is no longer the safe place you imagined,"" one woman in Kharkiv told CNN. ""I can't believe it's happening, really."" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced a curfew from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. local time, and the capital went dark late Thursday as residents left the streets deserted and either switched off their lights or drew their curtains. While major details about the incursion -- including total casualties -- remain shrouded in the fog of war, UK military intelligence earlier said more than 80 strikes had been carried out against Ukrainian targets, while a senior US defense official said the Russians had launched more than 160 missiles. Russia also deployed 75 fixed-wing heavy and medium bombers in the initial attack and initiated ""some ground incursions"" into Ukraine from Belarus, northwest of Kyiv, the US official added. The Russian military released a statement Thursday claiming it was not targeting Ukrainian cities, saying ""the civilian population is not at risk."" Still, many Ukrainians chose to leave the capital, while others hunkered down in shelters.",47,3.064535594263306,1.0488431575773731,2.015692436685933,25

The offensive that Russia called a ""special military operation"" came as world leaders attempted to avert catastrophe with a meeting of the United Nations Security Council amid warnings that a possible invasion could start the biggest war in Europe since 1945. The first blasts were heard at around 5 a.m. Thursday, prompting immediate condemnation from the United States and its allies, which have threatened to enact ""full scale"" sanctions in response to Russian military aggression. As air raid sirens rang out across Kyiv early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky moved to enact martial law and government ministers accused Moscow of launching a ""full scale invasion."" As dawn broke, heavy traffic could be seen clogging roads heading west out of the city, while further east, near the Russian border, the mayor of Kharkiv urged citizens not to leave their homes. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted on his official page that ""peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strike"" and called the situation ""a war of aggression."" And an adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Minister, Anton Gerashchenko, told journalists Russia's ""invasion has begun"" with ""missile strikes on Kyiv."" CNN witnessed, through a livestream video, troops atop a column of military vehicles entering Ukraine from a border crossing with Belarus. The livestream video was taken at the Senkivka, Ukraine crossing with Veselovka, Belarus. The column was seen entering Ukraine at about 6:48 a.m. local time. In recent weeks, Russia has amassed a significant number of troops, vehicles and tanks in Belarus near the border with Ukraine. During that time, the two countries have held joint military exercises across the countries, and near the Belarus-Ukrainian border. CNN teams in Russia and Ukraine also heard blasts from several parts of Ukraine, including near the capital Kyiv and the port city of Odessa, and images released by the office of President Zelensky showed large explosions to the east of the capital Kyiv with huge columns of smoke rising into the air. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said five Russian aircraft and a helicopter were shot down early Thursday, claims Russia denied via state news agency TASS. Hours before, Putin announced a military operation in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which contains the separatist-held regions of Donetsk and Luhansk which Moscow recognized as independent on Monday -- in violation of international law. In the address, broadcast live on Russian national television, Putin urged Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home, saying all responsibility for possible bloodshed would be entirely on the conscience of the Ukrainian government. ""Our plans are not to occupy Ukraine, we do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,"" he said, but threatened ""those who may be tempted to intervene"" on Ukraine's behalf. ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never experienced in your history,"" he said. Before the announcement of military action, Zelensky appealed for peace but vowed the country would defend itself. ""If we are attacked militarily, if they try to take away our freedom, our lives, our children's lives, we will defend ourselves,"" the Ukrainian President said, in a speech in Russian and directed at Russian citizens.""When you attack, you will see our faces and not our spines, our faces."" In a second video message posted to his official Facebook page Thursday, Zelensky said Russia ""began an attack on Ukraine today"" and that Ukrainian forces had ""already taken on the first blow of the enemy and are resisting."" ""Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we've been building, everything we are living for,"" he said. US President Joe Biden issued a statement saying Russia had launched ""an unprovoked and unjustified attack"" on the Ukrainian people. ""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,"" he said. ""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable."" ""These are among the darkest hours for Europe since the end of World War II. A major nuclear power has attacked a neighbor country and is threatening reprisals of any other states that may come to rescue,"" said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in Brussels. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to ""weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernize"" following its ""barbaric attack"" against Ukraine. ""We will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets,"" she said. Russian stocks plunged Thursday after trading resumed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. The Russian ruble also crashed to an all-time low against the dollar and the euro. What's happening on the ground Ukraine's borders were reportedly under attack from Russian forces to the north in Belarus and the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Russian troops had attacked border units, patrol border and checkpoints with ""artillery, heavy equipment and small arms,"" the border service said. The Russian military claimed Ukraine's border service ""did not provide any resistance"" and claimed to have ""suppressed"" Ukraine's air defenses. CNN was not able to immediately verify either of those claims. CNN teams on the ground heard explosions in and near multiple Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, the second largest city Kharkiv, Odessa, and distant firing from Zaporizhzhiya. Ukraine Interior Minister adviser Gerashchenko tweeted that troops had landed in the southern city of Odessa and were crossing the border in Kharkiv, located in the country's northeast. In a post on his Facebook page, he also said control centers such as airfields and military headquarters were being hit by shelling in Kyiv and Kharkiv, and that there was artillery fire along the border. The Russian military released a statement Thursday claiming it was not targeting Ukrainian cities, saying ""the civilian population is not at risk."" ""The Russian Armed Forces are not launching any missile or artillery strikes on the cities of Ukraine. High-precision weapons destroy military infrastructure: military airfields, aviation, air defense facilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"" the statement read. But despite the Russian military's claims that civilians wouldn't be targeted, many chose to leave the capital. Kyiv residents had previously been told to stay at home and pack a bag with necessities, in case they needed to leave abruptly. Witnesses told CNN that subway stations had become improvised bunkers and were full of people, with supplies organized in groups. Across the city, red arrows painted on walls indicate the locations of the nearest bomb shelters. The city first put them up after the war broke out in the east of the country in 2014, but they were recently repainted. Before Putin's address, Russia issued a notice banning civil aircraft from flight routes bordering northeastern Ukraine. Separately, Ukrainian aviation authorities issued a notice restricting Ukrainian airspace in the regions around Kyiv, Dnipro, Lviv, Odessa and Simferopol. European aviation regulators warned civilian aircraft were at ""high risk"" near the Ukrainian border. ""Air operators are reminded that this is now an active conflict zone,"" said the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, known as EASA. In an apparent escalation in cyberattacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, several key Ukrainian websites were down as of 3 a.m local time on Thursday (8 p.m. ET Wednesday), including those of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, Interior Ministry, the Security Service in Ukraine, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Infrastructure, and the Ministry of Justice. Military operation comes as UN Security Council meets The launch of the military operation came as members of the UN Security Council met in New York to call for a peaceful resolution to the impending crisis. In ordering troops to enter Ukraine, Putin had ""delivered a message of war,"" said US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield. ""This is a grave emergency. The council will need to act,"" she said. ""We will put a resolution on the table tomorrow."" Her Ukrainian counterpart Sergiy Kyslytsya begged the Security Council to help stop a war, saying it was too late to speak about de-escalation. ""It is the responsibility of this body to stop the war,"" Kyslytsya said. ""So I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war,"" he added, looking around the room. Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said the aim of Russia's military operation in Donbas was to protect locals who have been ""suffering genocide"" at the hands of the Ukrainian government for over eight years. ""The route of today's crisis around Ukraine is the actions of Ukraine itself, who for many years were sabotaging its obligations under the Minsk package of measures,"" said Nebenzya.",47,2.6799284325539987,3.8855697366047246,-1.205641304050726,25
2022-02-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-2-cmd-intl/index.html,What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained,"Russia's multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding. After months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia's side of the border, Ukraine's 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations. Russia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep. Frenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country. The escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia's attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow. So how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know. How did Russia invade Ukraine? Several areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a ""special military operation"" and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms. The move came after months of speculation about what Moscow's intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials. In late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow's closest international ally. Some of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv. Missile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania. Russia's larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow's attempts. That resistance has been ""stiffer than expected"" and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated. But US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance. The US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin's move. NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a ""grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security."" And a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia's economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked. The coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation. The territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia's intended creep into Ukraine. What set the stage for the conflict? Ukraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future -- crossing a red line for Russia. Putin has seen NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act"" -- a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine's aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia. In interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe. In early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. In the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create ""a pretext for an invasion."" What does Putin want? In a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people,"" and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia's orbit through a ""forced change of identity."" That type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin's emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine's own sovereignty. But Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West's ""puppet."" In fact, Putin's efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance. In December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe -- proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters. Putin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. ""It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,"" he said at his annual news conference late last year. ""Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep."" High-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe's leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine's east -- known as the Normandy Format talks -- could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis. In a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a ""genocide"" against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress -- echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea. But less than a week later, after Russia's upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements ""no longer exist,"" adding: ""What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?"" The agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 -- which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine -- have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved. Moscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and -- although unclear in what sequence -- would also restore the Ukrainian government's control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics. Putin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. ""Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,"" Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: ""We are not his."" How has Ukraine responded?

2022-02-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/politics/us-troops-ukraine-russia-nato/index.html,Here's what Biden has said about sending US troops to Ukraine,"President Joe Biden has warned Americans they will have to pay a price for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Gas prices are likely to rise. The post-World War II world order that has maintained relative peace in Europe is threatened. But Biden has also been very clear on another point: US troops will not be sent to Ukraine to take part in the conflict. As he announced new sanctions on Russia on Thursday, Biden said, ""Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict."" He added, ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the east."" When he announced the first tranche of sanctions against Russia for beginning its invasion on Tuesday, Biden similarly took great care to make clear the US was not being aggressive toward Russia. ""Let me be clear: These are totally defensive moves on our part. We have no intention of fighting Russia,"" Biden said. Earlier in February, Biden told NBC News he would not consider any scenario that included sending US troops to evacuate Americans in Ukraine. ""There's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another,"" he said. While Biden's clarification that US troops would not become offensively involved can help avoid a conflict between the US and Russia, critics pointed out it also made clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin that his forces would face fewer obstacles in their invasion. ""Biden diluted our most important source of leverage in this crisis,"" Ian Brzezinski, former Pentagon official under President George W. Bush told the New York Times earlier this month. US troops are in countries that border Ukraine A major element of Putin's invasion is his fear that Ukraine could become part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, which was formed after World War II to contain the Soviet Union and has expanded in recent decades to include former Soviet bloc countries. Ukraine borders the NATO member countries of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. If Russia threatened one of these countries, the US would be required by the agreement to defend them. ""We want to send an unmistakable message, though, that the United States, together with our Allies, will defend every inch of NATO territory and abide by the commitments we made to NATO,"" Biden said Tuesday. He said something similar last week, in remarks from the White House, but he added clearly, ""We also will not send troops in to fight in Ukraine, but we will continue to support the Ukrainian people."" Moving troops within NATO countries While Biden has pledged not to send US troops to Ukraine, the US has sent additional troops and fighter jets to eastern European countries including Poland and Romania in recent weeks and on Thursday announced the deployment of 7,000 additional troops to Germany. After Russia's invasion and attack on Ukraine, CNN is reporting that the Biden administration is considering moving more US forces already in Europe to countries farther east due to the massive Russian firepower so close to allies, according to a US official familiar with the matter. ""Today we activated NATO's defense stance that gives our military commanders more authority to move forces and to deploy forces when needed, and of course this can also be elements of the NATO response force,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday. ""We are ready, we are adjusting our posture but what we do is defensive, measured, and we don't seek confrontation. We want to prevent the conflict."" Opposition to major US involvement Americans are wary of US intervention in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to polls taken in the runup to Russia's invasion. In an AP-NORC poll, conducted last Friday through this Monday, just 26% of Americans believed the US should play a major role in the situation between Russia and Ukraine. About half, 52%, said it should play a minor role and another 20% that it should play no role at all. One-third of Democrats (32%) and 22% of Republicans wanted the US to play a major role. Independents were most likely to say the US should play no role; 32% felt that way, compared with 22% among Republicans and 14% among Democrats. In light of the polling, Biden and American officials would have to be very careful to engage the public before changing the administration's position on the commitment of US troops.

President Joe Biden said at the White House Thursday that he'd ordered additional ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, and he said that ""additional US force capabilities"" would be sent to Germany. ""The United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,"" the President said. ""And the good news is NATO is more united and more determined than ever."" A senior US defense official told reporters shortly after Biden's announcement that Austin had ordered the new deployment to Europe. ""This would comprise an armored brigade combat team with associated capabilities and enablers,"" the official said. ""They will deploy to Germany to reassure NATO Allies, deter Russian aggression and be prepared to support a range of requirements in the region. We expect them to depart in the coming days."" Russia's invasion of its neighbor in Ukraine is the largest conventional military attack that's been seen since World War II, the senior defense official said Thursday outlining US observations of the unfolding conflict. ""We haven't seen a conventional move like this, nation-state to nation-state, since World War II, certainly nothing on this size and scope and scale,"" the official told reporters Thursday. ""And if it unfolds the way that hereto we have come to believe that it will, it has every potential to be very bloody, very costly and very impactful on European security writ large, perhaps for a long, long time to come."" The US had been issuing stark warnings for weeks that Russian President Vladimir Putin would launch an attack on Ukraine on a scale not seen in decades. The US and its European allies are set to unveil sanctions on Russia Thursday in response to Moscow's aggression, though US President Joe Biden has made clear US troops deploying to NATO counties in eastern Europe will not be drawn into the conflict in Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO. Russia's initial attack included ""three main axes of assault,"" according to the defense official. The initial attack included more than 100 Russian-launched missiles, including short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles and sea-launched missiles from the Black Sea. There were 75 fixed-wing heavy and medium bombers that were also part of the initial attack, the official said, and Russia began ""some ground incursions"" into Ukraine from Belarus, which borders Ukraine to the north. Russian troops had been stationed in Belarus for what Moscow claimed were military exercises. So far, the Russian military has targeted military and air defense targets in Ukraine, including barracks, ammunition warehouses and nearly 10 airfields, the official said. ""We do not have a good sense of total damage, as you might expect. We do not have a good sense of casualties, civilian and/or military,"" the official added. The US plans to continue its recent pattern of selectively revealing Putin's plans as they learn them, officials said Thursday, even though it's now clear the strategy could not prevent an invasion of Ukraine. Officials say they expect to continue using the tactic of releasing intelligence, not necessarily to deter Putin -- which hasn't proved successful -- but to counter Russian claims about events on the ground. That could include rebutting Russian claims about atrocities or seeking to expose some of Putin's plans ahead of time. More US military assets will arrive in Eastern European countries later Thursday, the senior defense official said. Six F-35s will arrive in Estonia, Lithuania and Romania, two to each country, according to the official. A group of attack helicopters ""are on their way,"" the official said, while noting there's been ""some weather issues"" to get them to their locations. ""We still expect those Apaches to get on site later today,"" the official said. On Tuesday, Biden announced more US military assets would be deployed to NATO allies in Eastern Europe. That announcement included the movement of up to eight F-35 strike fighters from Germany to other Eastern European nations along NATO's eastern flank, 20 AH-64 helicopters from Germany to the Baltic region, and 12 AH-64 helicopters moved from Greece to Poland, a senior defense official said Tuesday. Biden and US officials have said repeatedly that US troops are not going into Ukraine, but they are being deployed to reinforce NATO's eastern flank. ""US troops remain outside of Ukraine,"" the official added..",4,2.4600723013180024,4.519197080359726,-2.0591247790417238,9
2022-02-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-visual-explainer-maps/index.html,Six maps explaining the Ukraine-Russia conflict,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday began a military operation in Ukraine after weeks of warnings by Western powers that such an attack was imminent. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine was also precipitated by years of rising tensions. Below are six maps that help illustrate the events that led to this moment. NATO since the Cold War Since the end of the Cold War, more countries have been joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, pushing the bloc eastward. In 2008, NATO declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine -- a former cornerstone of the Soviet Union -- some day in the distant future. But Russia considered that crossing a red line. This map shows NATO's expansion eastward in Europe. Many countries in western Europe joined prior to 1991 and the end of the Cold War, while those to the east -- including the former Soviet Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- joined in the years since. Putin has indicated he sees NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act."" He has emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically, and Russia asked amid recent tensions for guarantees the European and North American defense alliance wouldn't expand further east. The United States and NATO have resisted. The alliance's ""open door policy"" states that any European country ready and willing to undertake the commitments and obligations of membership is welcome to apply for membership. And since the end of the Cold War, more than a dozen countries from the former Eastern bloc have joined. Annexing part of Ukraine In early 2014, mass protests in the Ukrainian capital forced out a Russian-backed president after he refused to sign a historic political and trade agreement with the European Union. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, highlighted in red along the Black Sea's northern coast in the map below, and fomenting a separatist rebellion that seized control of part of the Donbas region along Ukraine's southeastern border with Russia. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Inflamed tensions In the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the US State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create ""a pretext for an invasion."" Those efforts have also manifested themselves on the ground, as seen in this map, which illustrates the buildup of Russia's military presence around Ukraine in the past year. Russia has amassed more than 150,000 troops, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep. As the situation on Ukraine's border has intensified, NATO has raised the readiness of its rapid response force, while member countries put troops on standby and deployed battalions, planes and ships to defend member states in the region. The buildup of these resources, seen in this map, includes thousands of US troops deployed in Poland. Russian invasion On February 21, Putin said he officially recognized the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), highlighted in the map below in red, in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there on the pretext of protecting the local population. The territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia's intended creep into Ukraine. Hours before dawn on Thursday, February 24, Russia's assault on Ukraine finally began with a series of missile attacks and the use of long-range artillery. This map shows the locations of reported attacks and explosions as of Thursday night, including in and around major cities such as the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, Kharkiv in the east and Odessa in the south, among others.

2022-02-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-attack-timeline-intl/index.html,Here's what we know about how Russia's invasion of Ukraine unfolded,"Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, sending troops into the ex-Soviet nation from three fronts and firing missiles on several locations near the capital, Kyiv, in a broad attack that has drawn deep condemnation from world leaders. At dawn, troops and armor crossed into eastern Ukraine from the Russian border, as well as from Belarus in the north and from Russia-annexed Crimea to the south. Here's how it unfolded. Stirrings in Crimea 3:59 a.m. (8:59 p.m. ET, Wednesday): Livestream video from a border crossing station between Crimea -- which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- and parts of southern Ukraine viewed by CNN showed what may have been the first signs of the Russian invasion. In the video, a guard at the Kalanchak crossing is seen reacting to something heading towards the Ukrainian border. The guard begins moving back towards the gate, and soon another guard comes into frame. About 25 seconds later, people who had just walked across to Crimea, are seen -- suitcases in tow -- running back across the border. The lights suddenly go out at the station, and the camera switches to black and white, recording in infrared. 4:08 a.m.: An individual dressed in camouflage is seen carrying a flashlight coming around one of the border guard stations. Three minutes later, three more individuals in camouflage are seen walking around the border crossing. Minutes later, the the camera cuts out. Very soon after, another webcam at the Chongar border crossing -- the only other active border crossing station from Crimea -- shows lights suddenly turning off, and, minutes later, the camera turns off as well. Putin announces 'operation' 4:50 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin made a speech, saying he had decided ""to conduct a special military operation ... to protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years,"" repeating a baseless claim about Ukraine's Russian-separatist-backed Donbas region. He denied, however, that Russia was planning to occupy Ukrainian territories. ""We are not going to impose anything on anyone by force."" He went on to warn: ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history."" Strikes begin 5.07 a.m.: Russian forces launched a series of missile attacks against locations near Kyiv, as well as the use of long-range artillery against the northeastern city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border. Before daylight: The strikes quickly spread across central and eastern Ukraine, as Russian forces attacked the country from three sides. People in the cities of Odessa, Dnipro, Mariupol and Kramatorsk reported huge blasts. Several detonations to the east of Kyiv let off massive plumes of gray smoke rising into the night sky. One of the chief targets was the main international airport at Boryspil, which is pummeled by missiles. Video showed a cruise missile hitting a military installation at the airport at Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine. Airports were also hit in Kharkiv, Ozerne, Kulbakino, Chuhuiv, Kramatorsk and Chornobaivka. Most of the targets were military bases, but there was clearly substantial damage in and around several cities. In Kharkiv, video emerged of an apartment block that had been damaged by a missile or long-range artillery. Another video showed a rocket embedded in a road. The State Emergency Service reported that six people were trapped in rubble in Nizhyn. Ukraine's interior ministry said ballistic missiles had been used as part of the offensive, while jets were heard over the central city of Zaporizhzhye. The Russians used a wide array of weaponry in their assault, including attack aircraft and helicopters, tanks, long range artillery and missiles. 6.48 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to Putin with a minute-long speech of his own, saying he had spoken to US President Joe Biden and that the US was rallying international support for Ukraine. ""The West is with us,"" he said, and announced martial law across the country. At the same time, a livestream video seen by CNN showed troops atop a column of military vehicles entering Ukraine from a border crossing with Belarus. The livestream video was taken at the Senkivka, Urkaine crossing with Veselovka, Belarus. Dawn breaks 7 a.m.: After dawn, air raid sirens sounded across Kyiv and at around 7:45 a.m., sirens go off in the western city of Lviv. A short time later, a single, unidentifiable plane roared above the capital. 8.00 a.m.: Ukraine claimed it had shot down five Russian aircraft and a helicopter. Russia denied losing any aircraft. As the day began in Kyiv, streams of vehicles could be seen crossing the North Bridge, heading west, away from the focus of the Russian assault. Other people in the capital sought shelter in subway stations. Across the country, long lines formed at gas stations and cash machines. A few people gathered in the streets of Kharkiv to pray. An eyewitness who saw and heard the latest strike in the town of Brovary on the outskirts of Kyiv described the situation as ""terrifying."" 11.28 a.m: Ukrainian leader Zelensky made a televised address, in which he said Russia has attacked Ukraine in a ""cunning way,"" comparing him to Hitler in World War II. He called on ""everyone who is able"" to join the military and called on veterans to come forward. ""From today our countries are on opposing sides of world history. Russia is on the side of evil, but it depends on the Russian people,"" he said. ""The people of Russia will have to choose which path each of them takes. Everyone in Russia who has not lost their honor, they have time to come out and protest this war."" 12:37 p.m.: More than 40 soldiers and about 10 civilians had been killed, Ukrainian authorities said. 12:45 p.m.: CNN teams in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and Mariupol heard more strikes, though they appear to be less severe than explosions reported earlier. 12:55 p.m.: Around five blasts were heard by a CNN team in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Around 2 p.m.: A K-52 ""Alligator"" Russian helicopter was shot down in the Kyiv region, near Mezhyhirya, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry confirmed. All timings are in local Ukrainian time and are estimates.",47,2.91052436041348,4.168280055292031,-1.2577556948785507,27
2022-02-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/russia-sanctions-fbi-cyber-threats-ransomware/index.html,US officials tell businesses to watch for potential ransomware attacks after Biden announces Russia sanctions,"Minutes after President Joe Biden announced new sanctions on Russian banks and elites on Tuesday, a senior FBI cyber official asked US businesses and local governments to be mindful of the potential for ransomware attacks as the crisis between the Kremlin and Ukraine deepens. Russia is a ""permissive operating environment"" for cybercriminals -- one that ""is not going to get any smaller"" as Russia's confrontation with the West over Ukraine continues and further sanctions are announced, the FBI's David Ring said on a phone briefing with private executives and state and local officials, according to two people who were on the call. Ring asked state and local officials and business executives to consider how ransomware attacks could disrupt the provision of critical services, the people on the call said. US officials continue to say there are ""no specific, credible"" threats to the US homeland tied to tensions with Russia over Ukraine, but they are preaching vigilance. The willingness of Russian-speaking cybercriminals to disrupt US critical infrastructure has been a US concern for years, but it came to a head last year when a ransomware attack forced major fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline to shut down for days. The phone call was one in a series of briefings that FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials have had for US companies and local governments in the last two months in light of US tensions with Russia over Ukraine. It had been scheduled before it was clear that Biden would address Russia's latest moves in Ukraine on Tuesday. The US President announced the ""first tranche"" of sanctions against Russian entities for Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to recognize two breakaway regions in Ukraine and send troops there. The US could also see ""a possible increase in cyber threat activity"" from Russian state-backed hackers as a result of those sanctions, Ring said, according to the people on the call. ""DHS has been engaging in an outreach campaign to ensure that public and private sector partners are aware of evolving cybersecurity risks and taking steps to increase their cybersecurity preparedness,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. CNN has requested comment from the FBI. The extortion of Colonial Pipeline had underscored for Biden administration officials the economic and national security threat posed by ransomware. The incident triggered long lines at gas stations in multiple US states and prompted Biden to call on Putin to rein in cybercriminals operating from Russian soil. While ransomware attacks on US organizations by Russian-speaking hackers have continued, Russian authorities have dangled the prospect of cracking down on some groups in recent months, as the standoff over Ukraine brewed. US officials said last month that they believe Russia has detained the person responsible for the Colonial Pipeline hack, but any cooperation between the two governments on cybercrime could be elusive if relations further deteriorate over Ukraine, according to some analysts. After the cyberattacks on Ukrainian government and banking websites last week that the Biden administration blamed on Russia's military intelligence directorate, US officials continue to see Russian cyber operations as likely playing a role in any further military invasion. In the event of a larger conflict between Russia and Ukraine, US officials are concerned that transportation networks and broadcast media in Ukraine could be shut down by kinetic or cyberattacks, Matthew Hackner, an official in DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis, said on Tuesday's phone briefing, according to people on the call.",20,7.448244430937793,3.835594653995577,3.6126497769422157,2
2022-02-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/europe/russia-ukraine-tensions-wednesday-intl/index.html,Ukraine to bring in state of emergency amid Russia tensions,"A state of emergency is to be introduced across all parts of Ukraine under government control, officials said Wednesday, while President Volodymyr Zelensky said reservists would be called up as Russian forces remain massed along Ukraine's borders, as fears of an incursion mount. Ukrainian, US and western officials told CNN that Washington on Tuesday warned Zelensky's government that the latest intelligence points to an imminent full-scale Russian invasion. A senior Ukrainian official said Kyiv has not verified the intelligence and noted that the United States has issued similar warnings before, about assaults that ultimately did not materialize. NATO allies have been given a similar intelligence assessment warning of an imminent Russian attack, according to a NATO military official. The official cautions that ""no one knows for sure"" what Putin is going to do. Zelensky introduced the state of emergency two days after Russian leader Vladimir Putin ordered troops into separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine. Moscow on Monday recognized those enclaves as independent, a blatant violation of international law that could spark a broader conflict in the region. US President Joe Biden called the events now underway in Ukraine the ""the beginning of a Russian invasion,"" and Western nations responded by instituting a raft of sanctions against the Kremlin. The Prime Minister of Latvia, a NATO member, and sources familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments said Russian troops have moved into the Ukrainian regions Moscow recognized as ""independent."" Ukraine's leaders said they are instituting a state of emergency to prevent Russia from sowing chaos inside its eastern neighbor. ""Across the territory of our country, apart from Donetsk and Luhansk, a state of emergency will be introduced,"" Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told a press briefing Wednesday in Kyiv. ""The main aim of the Russian Federation is to destabilize Ukraine from inside and to achieve its objective. To prevent this from happening, we decided today and made this decision today."" The emergency measure is expected to be approved by the Ukrainian Parliament within 48 hours. It would last for 30 days and can be extended for an extra 30 days. The state of emergency would include ""strengthening public order and security at critical infrastructure facilities"" and tightening inspections on certain transportation movements, Danilov said. ""Depending on the local circumstances, there may be stronger or milder measures to ensure the security of our country,"" he added. ""These are all preventative measures, in order to preserve peace and calm in the country and for the economy to continue to work."" A state of emergency has been in place in Ukraine's separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014, when pro-Russian separatists took control. Ukraine's leaders insist they are still seeking a diplomatic resolution to the crisis, at the same time as readying the country for any potential conflict. President Zelensky announced Tuesday that reservists would be called up for military training but said there would be no general mobilization of the armed forces. He also stressed that he was still pursuing diplomacy as a way out of the crisis. Notwithstanding such diplomatic efforts, Ukraine's response to any potential attack by Russia ""will be instant,"" Danilov said Wednesday. ""We are aware of the risks posed by the Russian Federation. We have a clear understanding that our army is ready to respond. It does not matter which city is under attack by Russia -- we are ready for it,"" he added. ""With regards to mobilization, this is a separate decision. At the moment, there has been no such decision. If the need arises, it will be approved -- it has not been approved yet,"" he added. 'Ready to defend my country' Ruslan Borovyk is one the reservists being called up. He served in the Ukrainian army when the war in eastern Ukraine started in 2014 and 2015 and fought in the two battles for Donetsk airport. He also served in Iraq in 2004 and 2005. He became a reservist and has worked in an organization supporting Ukrainian veterans, but now he is getting ready to possibly fight again. ""I'm a conscious citizen, I'm a patriot of my country and, of course I'm ready. I'm always ready to defend my country. If we were to give in to Putin's terms and conditions, and we're not sure in our strength, then in 2014 we would have lost,"" he told CNN. ""If you know the history of Ukraine, at least every 50 years, we had some conflicts with the Russian Empire. We had conflicts all the time. And at this time we are ready. We're not gonna lose, nobody's welcoming Putin here, there is no easy path for him. I'm confident in my country, in my army and in my people,"" he added. It's not just the reservists getting drafted. The recruitment center of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Force across the street from Kyiv's town hall was buzzing with activity on Wednesday. The force is comprised mostly of civilian volunteers who receive military training and are charged with protecting key sites. ""In the summer, we received two to four calls in a week,"" said Pavlo Shchybria, who was manning the information desk, collecting contact details from the volunteers and advising them how to proceed. ""By the beginning of the winter, 20 to 30 people were calling each week, now, since the beginning of February, we have 200 people a day,"" he said. Dmytro Ovsienko was one of those coming to the center to sign up on Wednesday. The 24-year old said he had been thinking about it for a while and decided now was the right moment. ""In 2014 and 2015, I wasn't 18 yet, so I couldn't sign up and then I had an operation so I wasn't fit enough,"" he said. ""But now, I understand that now is the time. I cannot wait any longer. The longer we wait, the worse the situation gets. So if everybody just sits and waits, nothing good happens,"" he said. Despite the tensions, the mood in Kyiv appeared calm Wednesday. People were out and about shopping and taking lunch breaks, with no sign that supermarket shelves were being cleared of essential goods. ""We are in Kyiv city and maybe you have seen that there is no panic. Nobody is buying up food, nobody is stocking up on medication, the stores are operating normally, all the institutions are working,"" Borovyk said. Putin: Russia 'open for direct and honest dialogue' The Kremlin's decree Monday recognizing the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, represented a sharp escalation in a long-running conflict. At the same time, new satellite images from Maxar Technologies show that in recent days additional troops, vehicles and logistics infrastructure have been deployed to the Ukrainian border by Russia. Social media videos geolocated and analyzed by CNN over the past several days appear to show the continuing build-up of armor and support vehicles in two regions just 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Ukraine's northeastern border. Putin said in a video message Wednesday that the country's interests were ""non negotiable"" -- but insisted he was open to dialogue for ""the most difficult problems."" ""We see how difficult the international situation is developing, what dangers the current challenges pose, such as weakening of the arms control system or the military activity of the NATO bloc,"" Putin said in a clip released by the Kremlin for a Russian national holiday, Defender of the Fatherland Day. ""At the same time, Russia's calls to build a system of equal and indivisible security that would reliably protect all countries remain unanswered,"" he added. Russia is ""always open for direct and honest dialogue, for finding diplomatic solutions to the most difficult problems,"" he added. ""But I repeat: Russia's interests and the security of our citizens are non-negotiable for us."" The press attaché for Russia's embassy in Kyiv, Denis Golenko, told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Wednesday that the departure of diplomatic staff from the embassy had begun. Last week, the leaders of the Russian-backed self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk republics ordered the mass evacuation of women, children and the elderly to Russia, while barring men aged 18 to 55 from leaving. Denis Pushilin, leader of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), said Wednesday that the situation had become critical in the face of what he called ""Ukrainian aggression,"" but added that the separatists would win with the help of what he called ""the Russian world."" ""Russian troops are not here at the moment,"" he said. ""Is it possible for Russian troops to be here? Maybe. If there is a full-scale offensive, Russia, within the framework of the agreement, has the right to do so."" Ukraine's defense minister said that, as of Wednesday evening local time, territory under Ukrainian control had been shelled 59 times from the self-declared republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. One Ukrainian serviceman was killed and another injured, according to the ministry. The separatists in Donbas have had substantial backing from Moscow since 2014, when the conflict in eastern Ukraine first erupted, shortly after Russia's illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. Russia has long maintained that it has no soldiers on the ground there, but US, NATO and Ukrainian officials say the Russian government supplies the separatists, provides them with advisory support and intelligence, and embeds its own officers in their ranks. Details of EU sanctions to come In a national address Tuesday, Ukraine's President welcomed an offer by Turkey to broker talks between Ukraine and Russia and called for a summit of all permanent members of the UN Security Council along with Germany and Turkey. Zelensky also welcomed the sanctions announced by Western governments against Russia, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's decision to suspend certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. US President Joe Biden described the events underway in Ukraine as ""the beginning of a Russian invasion"" as he announced new sanctions against Moscow on Tuesday. Latvian Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Wednesday: ""According to the information at my disposal, Putin is moving additional forces and tanks into the occupied Donbas territories,"" . ""By any definition that's a crossing of a sovereign territory into a neighboring country."" Pressed specifically on whether he was referring to the entry of additional Russian troops since Moscow recognized the two separatist regions earlier this week, Kariņš replied: ""Yes, according to the information at my disposal, this is exactly what we're seeing."" Without providing evidence, both the European Union's Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that Russian troops had",4,3.2911810467671176,1.9477043489241113,1.3434766978430064,15

The US intelligence assessment comes as foreign leaders and top US officials are warning about an imminent attack and say that Russian troops are moving into the pro-Moscow region of eastern Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview with ABC News Wednesday evening tbihat while he couldn't give specifics, ""everything we've seen over the last 24 to 48 hours has Russia of putting the final touches on having its forces in place across all of Ukraine's borders, to the north, to the east, to the south, to be ready for a full on invasion."" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a media briefing in Australia, which occurred Tuesday evening eastern time, that ""Russia is at peak readiness to now complete a full-scale invasion of Ukraine."" Morrison, whose country is a member of the Five Eyes alliance that shares intelligence, said it was ""likely to occur within the next 24 hours."" And on Wednesday morning, the Prime Minister of Latvia, a NATO member, told CNN that Russian troops have moved into the separatist region of Ukraine that Russia has now recognized as ""independent."" Later on Wednesday, the Pentagon also said it believes Russian troops are moving into the region. ""We certainly believe that Russian, additional Russian military forces are moving into that region,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said at an on-camera briefing at the Pentagon. ""We can't confirm with any great specificity the numbers, and what the formations are, what the capabilities are, but we certainly believe that that's happening."" In an address posted to Facebook in the early hours Thursday Ukrainian time, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he tried to call Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday but was unsuccessful. ""Today I initiated a telephone conversation with the President of the Russian Federation. Silence. Although there should be silence in the Donbass,"" Zelensky said. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday night at the request of Ukraine. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting with a message for the Russian President. ""If indeed an operation is being prepared. I've only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart: President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine,"" he said. ""Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died."" Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said that US President Joe Biden told her to convey ""that the United States, and our allies and partners, will continue to respond to Russia's actions with unity, clarity, and conviction."" ""We are here tonight because we believe, along with Ukraine, that a full-scale, further invasion into Ukraine by Russia is imminent,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""This is a perilous moment. And we are here for one reason and one reason only: to ask Russia to stop. Return to your borders. ... Back away from the brink, before it is too late."" Amid the warnings Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday approved the government's declaration of a state of emergency, which would be imposed across the country starting at midnight Wednesday. ""According to the information at my disposal, Putin is moving additional forces and tanks into the occupied Donbas territories,"" Latvian Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš told CNN's Jim Sciutto. ""By any definition that's a crossing of a sovereign territory into a neighboring country."" Pressed specifically on whether he was referring to the entry of additional Russian troops since Moscow recognized the two separatist regions earlier this week, Kariņš replied: ""Yes, according to the information at my disposal, this is exactly what we're seeing."" The heads of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, the two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, asked Putin for help Wednesday repelling the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti. Two other sources familiar with US intelligence confirmed to CNN that additional Russian troops have in fact crossed the border into the Donbas region since Putin recognized the two regions and issued an order deploying ""peacekeepers"" into the Donbas on Tuesday. According to a senior US official familiar with the latest intelligence, Russia has deployed one to two so-called battalion tactical groups, Russia's main combat formation, each of which comprise an average of about 800 troops. CNN has not independently verified the presence of additional Russian troops in the Donbas. New intelligence warnings The new warning from US intelligence was conveyed to Ukraine on Tuesday morning local Kyiv time, according to three of the sources. A senior Ukrainian official said Ukraine has not verified the intelligence and noted that the United States has issued similar warnings before, for assaults that ultimately did not materialize. The US has assessed that Russia has completed all preparations for an invasion, a senior US defense official familiar with the latest intelligence. ""They are as ready as they can be,"" the official said. NATO allies have been given a similar intelligence assessment warning of an imminent attack, according to a NATO military official. The official cautioned that ""no one knows for sure"" what Putin is going to do. Newsweek first reported on the US warning. Of particular concern, the US warned, is the major northeastern city of Kharkiv, according to the senior Ukrainian official and a western official familiar with the intelligence. The Ukrainian foreign minister said on Tuesday there were no plans to evacuate the city, ""We do not have such plans,"" he said during a press conference in Washington alongside Secretary of State Antony Blinken The US believes Putin is ""improvising"" and ""adapting"" in response to the United States revealing information about his war plans, the White House alleged on Wednesday. Speaking during a daily briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Putin did not expect the level of transparency from the US about what it saw on the ground and how it expected Putin to proceed. ""Our assessment is that President Putin did not expect the United States to have the level of information that we have, did not expect us to put out this amount of information that we have put out, did not expect the global community to be as unified, including in the how unified the global community was in putting out the sanctions yesterday,"" she said. Psaki said the US was not predicting a ""day, a moment or an hour"" of a Russian attack but said the US still believes ""Russian military forces are in an attack position"" and ""they are capable of operationalizing."" Vice President Kamala Harris threatened further sanctions on Russia for the country's aggressive actions ahead of a meeting with leaders from the National Black Caucus of State Legislators on Wednesday, calling the situation on the ground a ""reinvasion."" ""If Russia goes further,"" Harris said, ""we will impose more costs that will be swift and severe."" US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would not only be ""a war of choice,"" but also ""a war of carnage"" that could kill thousands. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room,"" Sherman said ""thousands of lives could be lost"" if Putin launches a full-scale assault on Ukraine. Blinken pushed back on the notion that a Russian invasion into Ukraine would be a failure of US diplomacy during an interview with CBS Evening News. ""Diplomacy succeeded very effectively in bringing the world together the United States and Europe together in standing up to Russian aggression,"" Blinken said. Russian forces in ready positions, Pentagon says A senior defense official told reporters at the Pentagon Wednesday that 80% of Russian forces amassed on Ukraine's border are ""in what we would consider forward positions, ready to go."" a senior defense official told reporters during an off-camera briefing at the Pentagon on Wednesday. Russian military forces ""arrayed around Ukraine and Belarus are as ready as they can be,"" for an invasion, the official said. Russian military capabilities along the Ukraine border are ""near 100% of all forces"" that the Pentagon anticipated Putin would move into the area, the official added. Putin has a ""full range of capabilities"" already moved to the Ukraine border, including ""significant offensive missile capability,"" ""two dozen warships in the Black Sea"" and ""armor, artillery, certainly infantry,"" according to the official. A data-wiping hacking tool was found on hundreds of computers in Ukraine Wednesday, according to cybersecurity researchers, raising concerns that a destructive cyberattack was unfolding as the Russian military moved into Ukraine's separatist regions. It wasn't immediately clear who was responsible for the hacking incident, which followed a different cyberattack earlier Wednesday on Ukrainian government websites. The Ukrainian government did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Social media videos geolocated and analyzed by CNN over the past several days show a continuing buildup of armor and support vehicles less than 30 kilometers across the border in Russia. US officials have said that they anticipate both a ground invasion and airstrikes should Russia launch an attack. ""Russian missiles and bombs will drop across Ukraine. Communications will be jammed. Cyberattacks will shut down key Ukrainian institutions,"" Blinken said last week before the UN Security Council, describing how the US believed a Russian attack on Ukraine would unfold. ""After that, Russian tanks and soldiers will advance on key targets that have already been identified and mapped out in detailed plans."" US, Europe say more sanctions ready if Putin further escalates Biden on Tuesday described events now underway in Ukraine as ""the beginning of a Russian invasion,"" though senior administration officials did not initially confirm whether additional Russian troops had entered into the Donbas, where unmarked Russian forces have been propping up separatist fighters since 2014. The US and European allies invoked sanctions against Moscow on Tuesday in response to Putin's moves, and the White House announced Wednesday that it will allow sanctions to move forward on the company in charge of building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. Kariņš told CNN that the initial round of sanctions from the US and Europe was only the beginning of the Western response toward Moscow if Putin escalates further in Ukraine.

2022-02-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/europe/ukraine-government-commercial-organizations-data-wiping-hack/index.html,Key Ukrainian government websites hit by series of cyberattacks,"Key Ukrainian government websites were down early Thursday morning local time following a day in which Ukrainian agencies dealt with multiple cyberattacks and as concerns mounted over Russian troop movements into Ukraine's separatist regions. The websites of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, and those of the ministries of foreign affairs, infrastructure, education and others, were experiencing disruptions. In a separate and potentially more serious hacking incident hours earlier, a data-wiping tool was found on hundreds of computers in Ukraine, according to cybersecurity researchers, raising concerns that a destructive cyberattack was unfolding amid Russia's military escalation. Taken together, the incidents represented an apparent escalation in cyberattacks on Ukrainian infrastructure as the US and its allies warned of an imminent Russian invasion in Ukraine and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and elites. In televised remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced military action in Ukraine's Donbas region Thursday morning, urging Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home. ""We are aware of multiple commercial and government organizations in Ukraine impacted by the destructive malware today,"" Charles Carmakal, senior vice president and chief technology officer for cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told CNN. The hacking incidents came as United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres made an eleventh-hour appeal to Russia to curtail military action. ""If indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart: President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine,"" Guterres told an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Wednesday night in New York. ""Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died."" US officials have warned that Russia will very likely use cyber operations in conjunction with military action in Ukraine. President Joe Biden said last month the US could respond with cyberoperations of its own if Russia conducts additional cyberattacks in Ukraine. The website disruptions early Thursday in Ukraine followed news Wednesday afternoon of a cyberattack that temporarily knocked offline the websites of the Ukrainian parliament, Security Service and Cabinet of Ministers. It wasn't immediately clear who was responsible for the destructive hacking incident, or the website disruptions early Thursday morning. The Ukrainian government did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine said the cyberattacks on websites reported earlier Wednesday were ""a continuation"" of cyberattacks that hit Ukrainian government websites on February 15. The White House blamed Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, for those hacks, which are known as distribute denial of service (DDoS) attacks because they overwhelm computer servers with phony traffic and knock websites offline. Russia's embassy in Washington denied the accusation. Of all the cyber incidents, though, the destructive data-wiping tool -- known as ""wiper"" malware -- had the potential to be the most impactful. Wiper malware typically deletes data from computers and renders them inoperable. That has the potential to hobble organizations trying to stay online in a conflict. The hack hit at least one Ukrainian financial institution and two Ukrainian government contractors, one with a presence in Latvia and the other with a presence in Lithuania, Vikram Thakur, technical director at Broadcom's cybersecurity unit Symantec, told CNN. The malicious code affected ""large organizations"" in Ukraine, according to cybersecurity firm ESET, which has multiple clients in the country. The hacking tool appears to have been created two months ago, but ""was deployed only today and we have seen it only in Ukraine,"" said Jean-Ian Boutin, head of threat research ESET. In the event of a larger conflict between Russia and Ukraine, US officials are concerned that transportation networks and broadcast media in Ukraine could be shut down by kinetic or cyberattacks, a senior Department of Homeland Security told state and local officials Tuesday. The goal right now for Ukrainian government agencies and key business is resiliency in the face of waves of hacking. Some agencies have been able to come back online relatively quickly following the DDoS attacks last week. US and numerous allied governments, along with private-sector experts, are providing cybersecurity support to Ukraine on the ground and remotely. ""With a top-tier cyber power like Russia, you're not going to keep them out 100%, so the goal is resilience,"" Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN. Asked if the US should conduct its own hacking operations in response to Russian activities in Ukraine, Warner said the US generally avoids ""opening Pandora's Box in terms of cyber escalation."" ""So far, that's been the right approach,"" Warner added. ""But we've never seen this sort of circumstance where Putin is willing to unleash 190,000 troops"" and threaten Kyiv, he added. ""We don't know what he'll do in the cyber realm."" This headline and story have been updated with additional reporting.",20,3.567839588937934,5.322076642744271,-1.754237053806337,2
2022-02-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/biden-invasion-sanctions/index.html,Biden says Russia is beginning an 'invasion of Ukraine' as he unveils sanctions on Moscow,"President Joe Biden described events now underway in Ukraine as ""the beginning of a Russian invasion"" as he unveiled tough new sanctions to punish Moscow on Tuesday. He laid out what he called a ""first tranche"" of US sanctions against Russia for its moves, including on two large financial institutions, Russian sovereign debt and Russian elites and their family members. He said the moves would effectively ""cut off Russia's government from Western finance."" Biden also announced he was moving additional troops and equipment to ""strengthen"" US allies in the Baltic nations on NATO's eastern flank, but made clear they would not be there to ""fight Russia."" The President held out the possibility that diplomacy could still defuse the crisis, and said the US would remain open to talking with Russia and its partners to avert all-out war. ""The United States and our allies and partners remain open to diplomacy, if it is serious,"" he said. ""When all is said and done, we're going to judge Russia by its actions, not its words."" Still, Biden made plain his view that Putin was launching a bid to fundamentally redraw borders in Europe, violating international laws and putting pressure on the West to respond. ""Who in the Lord's name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbors? This is a flagrant violation of international law and demands a firm response from the international community,"" Biden said. Biden said Putin's remarks a day earlier were ""setting up a rationale to take more territory by force, in my view."" Biden's description of a Russian invasion in Ukraine immediately ups the stakes for his response. He and other senior officials have vowed to impose severe economic consequences if Russian troops cross into Ukraine, including on members of Putin's inner-circle and Russian financial institutions. The steps Biden announced Tuesday did not amount to the full scope of that response. Biden is reserving some of his toughest measures, hoping to use them should Putin wage the type of bloody and sustained attack US officials have been warning about for weeks. Tuesday's sanctions are ""only the sharp edge of the pain we can inflict,"" a senior US administration official said after Biden's remarks, suggesting the President is ready to go much further should an invasion of Ukraine escalate. ""This is the beginning of an invasion, and therefore this is the beginning of our response,"" the official said. Biden pledges to limit the impact on US gas prices Biden pledged his administration was using ""every tool at our disposal"" to limit the effect of sanctions on domestic gas prices, acknowledging that Americans will likely see rising prices at the pump in the coming months. ""As I said last week, defending freedom will have costs, for us as well and here at home,"" Biden said. ""We need to be honest about that. But as we do this, I'm going to take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours."" The administration began describing events in eastern Ukraine as an ""invasion"" earlier Tuesday after assessing the situation on the ground there, according to administration officials. The White House declined to provide specific intelligence that might further explain the shift in tone. ""We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia's latest invasion into Ukraine,"" US principal deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said in an interview on CNN's ""New Day,"" adding the sanctions imposed Monday were the merely the ""beginning"" of the US response. ""An invasion is an invasion and that is what is underway,"" Finer said. ""I am calling it an invasion."" Another top US official, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, told the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Russia's actions ""are the beginning of the latest Russian invasion of Ukraine."" ""They are utterly unprovoked and unjustified,"" Sherman said. ""Moscow calls these troops 'peacekeepers,' but we all know this is a lie."" That was further than US officials were willing to go on Monday evening, and reflected the growing sense among Biden's team that a fuller assault on Ukrainian territory would begin shortly. Officials said continued signs of Russian aggression overnight led to a change in tone. Still, Finer noted Russian troops have been operating in the two separatist regions since 2014, when Russia initiated an incursion into Ukraine, and suggested the latest steps taken by Moscow were an extension of that. ""I think 'latest' is important here,"" Finer said. ""An invasion is an invasion, and that is what is underway, but Russia has been invading Ukraine since 2014."" There are substantial numbers of Russian troops close to the borders with the newly recognized republics. But CNN has not seen social media video nor satellite imagery showing newly arrived Russian units inside either of the separatist-held regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. US still believes Putin may launch a fuller invasion The US continues to assess it is still possible Putin moves ahead with a fuller invasion, and Western officials are being vigilant for additional indicators, according to two US officials briefed on the assessment. There may be window of dry weather, making it easier for the Russians to move heavy equipment, along with cloud cover that could help obscure movements. Still, one of the officials acknowledged ""we don't know what his next move will be."" The developments were unfolding as Putin ordered Russian troops into two separatist-held regions of Eastern Ukraine after declaring them independent. Biden, responding in the hours after Putin signed the orders, issued a narrow set of restrictions limiting financial activity in the two regions. As he was readying Tuesday's announcement, the US was coordinating with allies in Europe in the hopes of averting a full-scale war. Earlier, Germany said it was halting certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, a step US leaders had been pressing for as the crisis heats up. ""With regard to the latest developments, we need to reassess the situation also with regard to Nord Stream 2. It sounds very technocratic but it is the necessary administrative step in order to stop certification of the pipeline,"" Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in Berlin. The 750-mile pipeline was completed in September but has not yet received final certification from German regulators. Without that, natural gas cannot flow through the Baltic Sea pipeline from Russia to Germany. The United Kingdom said Tuesday it was slapping sanctions on five Russian banks and three wealthy individuals following Putin's decision to recognize two separatist republics. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the sanctions in a statement to the UK parliament on Tuesday, saying Putin was ""establishing the pretext for full scale invasion"" of Ukraine. The European Union was also preparing a first package of sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, its top official said in a joint statement on Tuesday. The package will contain proposals targeting those involved in the ""illegal decision"" to recognize two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and banks that are ""financing Russian military and other operations in those territories."" Those sanctions will also limit Russian state and government to access the EU's capital and financial markets. This story has been updated to reflect additional developments on Tuesday.",4,2.1490061031984933,0.8189189590968831,1.3300871441016102,7
2022-02-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/ukraine-vladimir-putin-us-diplomacy-russia/index.html,Putin's next moves are critical for Ukraine -- and Americans,"What happens in the coming hours will decide how bad the Ukraine crisis gets for the vulnerable democracy in Russian President Vladimir Putin's sights but also its potentially huge impact on Americans and an already deeply unstable world. Whether Putin stages a full-scale invasion into all of Ukraine or limits his incursion to sending troops to two pro-Moscow regions in the east that he recognized as independent on Monday will dictate the severity of sanctions the US and its allies say will be the most consequential ever imposed on Moscow. The question of whether he has ambitions beyond eastern Ukraine also has wider implications. His alarming speech Monday that slammed NATO for disrespecting and threatening Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union could plunge Washington and Moscow back into a new Cold War-style confrontation after 30 years of relative calm in Europe. And developments in the hours and days to come will have massive implications for Americans. A Russian invasion of the rest of Ukraine send already sending the soaring gasoline prices and inflation that have hammered wallets in the US much higher. It would also land another blow against President Joe Biden's credibility and hand him an intractable challenge with his Democrats already at risk of huge losses in midterm election year. The omens are very, very dark. At the stroke of a pen Monday, Putin sliced off two more pieces of an independent, sovereign nation to add to his seizure of Crimea in 2014. Moscow said it would send what it called ""peacekeepers"" to the regions. Its euphemism notwithstanding, US officials fear that the force could be the vanguard of the full invasion mobilization they have predicted for days. As bad as this flash of gangster geopolitics already is, things could get a lot worse. If Putin were to stop here, it is possible that the Ukraine crisis could be contained, and even give the Russian President an opening to deescalate the situation and desist from a full invasion of the entire country after pocketing new territory in his quest to prevent Ukraine from moving toward the West. Such a step back -- perhaps designed to divide the US from less hawkish allies -- might avoid a wider global crisis. In the US, this interim scenario might also spare Americans a damaging new spike in gasoline prices and inflation and allow Biden to escape another blow to his credibility in a tough midterm election year. Unfortunately, however, the evidence of Putin's own furious rhetoric on Monday, the presence of up to 190,000 Russian troops on Ukraine's borders and most assessments of US leaders and intelligence officials suggest hopes for a limited conflict are wishful thinking. In his speech from the Kremlin, Putin made clear that he sees Ukraine as indistinguishable from Russia and not an independent entity -- hardly an argument that suggests restraint. In fact, his screed came across as a justification for a far larger venture than a limited incursion into the east of the country. He referred to Ukraine as ""an integral part of our own history, culture, spiritual space"" and referred to comrades, relatives and people ""connected with us by blood."" ""Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia,"" he added. In a United Nations Security Council emergency meeting on Monday evening, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield argued that Russia's designation of troops it was sending to eastern Ukraine as ""peacekeepers"" was ""nonsense."" She said the force was an ""attempt to create a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine."" A speech that set Ukrainians on edge Putin's propagandistic view of history did not amount to a declaration of an invasion or an attempt to reunite Ukraine with the Motherland. But it would be easy to read it as an attempt to prepare the Russian people for war. It also surely augured a long-term effort to dominate and destabilize a democracy that includes large numbers of citizens who yearn to join NATO and the European Union. Putin's most chilling line came when he appeared to lay the groundwork for treating any attack on Russian forces due to enter eastern Ukraine as a pretext for a wider conflict that the US has said could kill thousands of civilians and trigger refugee flows. ""From those who seized and hold power in Kyiv, we demand an immediate cessation of hostilities,"" Putin said of a government that, unlike him, was chosen in a free and fair election. ""Otherwise, all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine."" Just as ominously, multiple US officials told CNN that they interpreted Putin's move on the two eastern Ukrainian regions, which call themselves the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic (DPR and LPR), as part of a steady march to a wider invasion of Ukraine. ""This is Potemkin politics,"" a senior administration official told reporters on Monday. ""President Putin is accelerating the very conflict that he's created."" As soon as Putin made his announcement, Biden consulted with the leaders of France and Germany and quickly announced a package of trade and finance sanctions against the two pro-Moscow regions. But he did not immediately roll out the devastating wave of measures against the Russian economy that he has promised in the event of an invasion of Ukraine. US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told CNN's Brianna Keilar on ""New Day"" Tuesday that additional sanctions were coming later in the day as part of a ""swift and severe response"" to Moscow's actions. The President got himself in some political trouble last month when he suggested that a ""minor incursion"" into Ukraine would not trigger the full force of the most punitive sanctions ever levied on Moscow. He inadvertently told the truth about divisions at the time between US and European allies over the exact moment when the full sanctions would turn on. Biden later clarified his comment, saying that sanctions would be triggered if ""any assembled Russian units"" rolled across the Ukrainian border. But again on Monday, administration officials appeared to make a distinction between eastern Ukraine and the rest of the country. ""There have been Russian forces present in these areas"" since 2014, a senior official told reporters. ""So we're going to be looking very closely at what they do over the coming hours and days and our response will be measured, according, again, to their actions,"" the official said. It was not clear whether the administration position was due to sequencing issues with allies over sanctions or whether it was seeking to preserve one last-ditch point of potential leverage with Putin. In any case, the Russian leader scoffed at the idea of sanctions in his speech. It is prudent for the US to actually punish Russia for what it does rather than what Putin says. But the semantics over what constitutes an invasion does risk diminishing the action that the Russian President took on Monday. It is well known that what Russia has described as pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine were trained by Russia and took its orders. In effect, Putin took a piece of another country, without giving that state a say in its destiny. This is classic expansionist autocracy using ethnic justifications and false claims that Russians were being persecuted and targeted by genocide -- a playbook shockingly familiar from the horror of the 1930s. The question of what constitutes an invasion of Ukraine may soon be moot anyway. The US has accurately predicted Putin's move through a pre-invasion checklist in recent days that includes moves in eastern Ukraine. And it may be correct again. Pressure on Capitol Hill The Biden administration, which has largely succeeded in building a united NATO front against Putin in recent weeks, is already facing demands from Capitol Hill for a swifter, harsher response to his land grab -- even from some Democrats. Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the US needed to put down a flag and to correctly define the pending dispatch of ""peacekeepers"" to eastern Ukraine. ""That's an invasion by any sense of the imagination,"" he said, adding that the most consequential sanctions ever against Moscow must immediately follow. Two leading Republican lawmakers laid into the Biden administration. ""As we've said for months, setting the trigger for meaningful sanctions to Russian tanks rolling across Ukraine's border was a dangerous mistake,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. ""We must immediately impose real costs for this blatant act of aggression and flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Unfortunately, the sanctions previewed by the White House thus far are the definition of impotence,"" the two Republicans wrote. US officials said late Monday that they expected Russian troops to start rolling into eastern Ukraine and the two rebel regions within hours. The world will soon thereafter find out whether Putin's bitter fury on Monday was a precursor of a wider conflagration that would effectively end the post-Cold War era and usher in a new age of tension in Europe. That reality would require a huge rethink of transatlantic security -- including the likely dispatch of thousands of US troops back to bases they left in 1990s and early 2000s. Such deployments would also complicate Washington's desire to pivot its military might to Asia to wage a burgeoning new Cold War-style conflict against a rising superpower, China. A prolonged geopolitical tussle with Russia would also force US and European policy makers to consider just how far Putin might try to push his effort to rewrite the borders of Europe. ""What worries me is what happens after Ukraine,"" former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on CNN on Monday evening. ""We have got a real crisis on our hands here."" Putin's argument, for example, that Ukrainians were blood brothers of Russians was especially worrying since it could be applied to other countries that include large numbers of ethnic Russians -- including the Baltic states, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, which were formerly under Soviet rule. Any attempt by Putin to extend his principle there could be hugely dangerous since all are now in NATO and benefit from the alliance's guarantee of mutual self-defense. The next few days will show how willing Putin is to act upon his words and will begin to answer Clapper's question. The evidence so far looks ominous.",4,2.150032067443168,0.8023303393359293,1.3477017281072385,22

It comes as diplomatic efforts to avoid an escalation appear to have stalled after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced he had canceled a planned meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva this week. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday the US will sanction Russia's financial institutions and oligarchs. The United Kingdom, European Union, Canada, Australia and Japan also announced fresh sanctions on Russia. Earlier in the day, Germany said it halted certifying a $11 billion 750-mile pipeline that connects Russia directly to Germany. The Nord Stream 2 project was completed in September but has not yet received the final green light from German regulators. Russia sharply escalated its military campaign against Ukraine on Monday night, recognizing two pro-Russian breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine before ordering troops into the territories. Moscow has long maintained that it has no soldiers on the ground in eastern Ukraine. However NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that Russia has had troops inside the regions -- known as the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) -- since they were self-declared in 2014. Stoltenberg slammed the troop movement as a ""further invasion of a country that has already been invaded."" Putin has not yet set a timeline for troops to move into the separatist regions, but in a speech Tuesday afternoon, Biden described events now underway in Ukraine as ""the beginning of a Russian invasion."" ""This is a flagrant violation of international law and demands a firm response from the international community,"" Biden said. In a national address on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was still pursuing diplomacy as a way out of the crisis. Reservists would be called up for military training, he said, but there will be no general mobilization of armed forces. ""We desire peace and calm, but if we are quiet today then tomorrow we will disappear,"" Zelensky said. The Ukrainian President also referred to Putin's announcement that the Minsk Agreements -- designed to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine -- no longer applied, saying that Ukraine remained committed to seeking its sovereignty and integrity. Putin, who has steadily amassed some 150,000 military personnel near Ukraine's borders, appeared to cast doubt on the sovereignty of Russia's neighbor in an angry speech on Monday. ""Ukraine has never had traditions of its own statehood,"" he said, seemingly calling into question the country's right to exist as an independent nation, and referring to its eastern region as ""ancient Russian lands."" On Tuesday, the EU sanctioned 351 Russian lawmakers who voted to recognize the breakaway regions and the UK announced sanctions against five Russian banks and three Russian oligarchs. Other nations, including Australia and Japan, vowed to work in lockstep with the international community on sanctions. The Baltic states -- long fearful of Russian encirclement -- watched Monday's events with alarm. ""Putin just put (Franz) Kafka & (George) Orwell to shame: No limits to dictator's imagination, no lows too low, no lies too blatant, no red lines too red to cross,"" the Prime Minister of Lithuania, Ingrida Šimonytė, wrote on Twitter. ""What we witnessed tonight might seem surreal for democratic world. But the way we respond will define us for the generations to come,"" she said. International condemnation Amid the clamor of countries condemning Russia's planned incursion, some nations steered clear of criticizing Moscow. During an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council Monday evening, India called for ""restraint on all sides,"" stopping short of criticizing Russia. China's envoy to the United Nations on Monday called for ""all parties"" to exercise restraint and avoid ""fueling tensions"" in Ukraine, but stopped short of condemning the Kremlin's recognition of independence for the DPR and LPR. China's Foreign Ministry evaded more than a dozen questions regarding Ukraine at a briefing on Tuesday. Kenya's envoy to the United Nations, however, delivered a blistering statement on Putin's imperial ambitions in Ukraine. ""We believe that all states formed from empires that have collapsed or retreated have many peoples in them yearning for integration with peoples in neighboring states. This is normal and understandable. After all, who does not want to be joined to their brethren and to make common purpose with them?"" Martin Kimani said Monday, according to a readout of his remarks. ""However, Kenya rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force. We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of dominion and oppression,"" he said, adding that Kenya rejected ""expansion on any basis, including racial, ethnic, religious or cultural factors."" For almost eight years, the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk have seen a low-intensity conflict between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces, which has left more than 14,000 people dead. Moscow has also distributed hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to people in Donbas in recent years. Western officials and observers have accused Putin of attempting to establish facts on the ground by naturalizing Ukrainians as Russian citizens. Kyiv and the West maintain that the region is part of Ukrainian territory, although the Ukrainian government asserts the two regions have been, in effect, Russian-occupied since 2014, when the conflict in eastern Ukraine began.

2022-02-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/21/politics/donetsk-luhansk-putin-possible-invasion-ukraine/index.html,"Putin moves in eastern Ukraine could be opening phase of possible large-scale invasion, multiple US and western officials say","Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to recognize breakaway eastern Ukrainian territories as independent could be the opening phase of a larger potential military operation targeting Ukraine, nearly a dozen US and western officials told CNN. ""This is Potemkin politics,"" a senior administration official told reporters on Monday. ""President Putin is accelerating the very conflict that he's created."" The US and western officials said Putin's decision to sign the decrees, which proclaim that the Russia-backed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) are independent territories, has given Putin the justification he wanted to send in Russian forces and potentially wage a broader assault on Ukraine in the name of protecting the separatist regions. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield called the announcement a pretext to an invasion. ""Russia's announcement is nothing more than theater, apparently designed to create a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine,"" she said in a statement. The US expects Russian troops could move into the Donbas region of Ukraine as soon as Monday evening or Tuesday, after Putin recognized the two pro-Moscow territories as independent, a senior US official familiar with the latest intelligence told CNN. The US is still seeing preparations for a potential broad invasion including loading amphibious ships and loading equipment for airborne units. The Kremlin announced on Monday evening that Russia would be sending what it called ""peacekeeping"" forces into the breakaway territories, confirming many officials' worst fears. ""That's your invasion,"" said one European diplomat. ""If we don't act on this as we have said we would in case of a further invasion, we will have seriously undermined our credibility,"" the diplomat said. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper weighed in on the move from Russia, telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer Monday evening that ""when any Russian troops march into any part of Ukraine under any pretense regardless of what it's called that, to me, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's an invasion."" Still, in a call with reporters the senior administration official suggested that the mere movement of what Russia is calling ""peacekeeping"" forces into eastern Ukraine would not itself trigger the full sanctions package the Biden administration has threatened in the event of a Russian invasion, noting that ""there have been Russian forces present in these areas"" since 2014. ""So we're going to be looking very closely at what they do over the coming hours and days and our response will be measured, according, again, to their actions,"" the official said. The official said ""it now looks like Russia will be operating openly in that region, and we will be responding accordingly."" The official would not identify what line Russian troops would have to cross in Eastern Ukraine to be considered a new invasion. The White House said on Monday that Biden would impose new financial restrictions on the breakaway republics, and the senior administration official told reporters that more actions would be announced on Tuesday. But some officials say the penalties do not go far enough -- especially considering Biden's claim last month that if ""any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion,"" which would be met with ""severe and coordinated economic response."" 'We're now in a whole new era' Putin formally signed the decree and ordered the forces in following a lengthy speech in which he called the situation in Ukraine's Donbas region ""critical,"" and suggested that Ukraine was planning an attack on Russia. ""The US and NATO shamelessly turned Ukraine into a theater of potential military action against Russia,"" Putin said in his remarks, which ran nearly an hour. ""We're now in a whole new era,"" said one western diplomat. ""This kills Minsk. It's not clear where we go from here. It's a very dangerous time because we don't know what Putin will do next."" The Minsk Protocol is a framework for peace in eastern Ukraine that the US and its allies have been urging Russia to implement and abide by since 2015, when the agreement was first drawn up amid bloody clashes between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas. The officials said the US had been expecting that Putin would make a move to recognize the breakaway republics, as he has steadily been massing more forces near Ukraine's borders. ""We knew this was going to happen,"" said one US official, adding that ""this is exactly what we have been predicting -- that he would find a pretext to justify further action."" That sentiment was echoed by White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday. ""We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately,"" Psaki said in a statement, in which she also outlined the new executive order Biden will sign imposing financial restrictions on the separatist territories. Putin's decision has put the US and its allies in a tricky position with regard to imposing consequences, several of the officials said. While the Biden administration will impose a cost on Putin for his recognition of the breakaway republics, the west also wants to maintain the threat of the most aggressive options as a deterrent to a full-scale invasion. ""To be clear: these measures are separate from and would be in addition to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in coordination with Allies and partners should Russia further invade Ukraine,"" Psaki said in her statement. Still, US and western officials said they hoped stronger sanctions would come -- and soon. ""I hope it is just an opening salvo,"" another European diplomat said of the sanctions announced by the White House on Monday in response to Putin's recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk. ""I expect a punch, not finger-wagging,"" the diplomat added. A European defense official, meanwhile, said that Putin's recognition of the breakaway republics is likely not his final goal. ""It will be the opening of the offensive, not a 'try and see what happens,'"" the officials said. ""If he goes for war, he will have to get his objectives fast and start preparing the 'peace' negotiations with the West.""",4,0.8275637386832996,2.810288910507497,-1.9827251718241974,7
2022-02-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/21/politics/us-letter-russia-ukraine-kill-list/index.html,US says it has credible information about Russian 'kill list' in potential Ukraine invasion,"The US has written to the top United Nations human rights official that it has ""credible information"" that Russian forces are identifying Ukrainians ""to be killed or sent to camps"" if it further invades Ukraine and occupies it. ""Disturbing information recently obtained by the United States that indicates that human rights violations and abuses in the aftermath of a further invasion are being planned,"" Ambassador Bathsheba Nell Crocker, the US Representative to the Office of the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva, alleges in a letter to Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""These acts, which in past Russian operations have included targeted killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, unjust detentions, and the use of torture, would likely target those who oppose Russian actions, including Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists and anti-corruption activists, and vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons,"" reads the letter, which was first reported by The Washington Post and obtained by CNN. ""Specifically, we have credible information that indicates Russian forces are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation. We also have credible information that Russian forces will likely use lethal measures to disperse peaceful protests or otherwise counter peaceful exercises of perceived resistance from civilian populations,"" the letter says. The letter did not say how the US obtained the information. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed that it received the message. Crocker added that the aim for sharing this information with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights was to give ""an early warning that a further Russian invasion of Ukraine may create a human rights catastrophe."" She said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised these concerns to the Security Council on February 17. ""In particular, he stated that the United States has information that indicates Russia will target specific groups of Ukrainians,"" Crocker added. The Kremlin on Monday denied the claim regarding a kill list and called it ""absolute fiction."" ""This is an absolute hoax, this is a lie,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN. Pressed on if he is aware of the existence of such a list, Peskov said, ""I know that this is absolute fiction, there is no such list, it is fake news."" CNN reported on Friday that multiple US and western government officials confirmed to CNN that the US has intelligence that Russia has drawn up lists of current political figures that it would target for removal in the event it invades Ukraine and topples the current government in Kyiv. Sources familiar with the intelligence said the target lists are part of Russian planning to replace the current administration in Kyiv with a more Russia-friendly government, bolstering a previous disclosure by the British government identifying pro-Moscow figures it said Russia planned to install. The most likely outcome for those politicians and public figures whom Moscow has targeted to be ousted in the event Kyiv falls, these sources said to CNN, is jail or assassination. CNN has not seen the underlying intelligence intercepts or the documents that name the targets or the purported collaborators and their supposed positions in a pro-Russia administration. Blinken said on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" over the weekend that the US would continue supporting Ukrainians if there is an invasion and a Ukrainian insurgency is left to fight. ""(President Joe Biden) said that we will, in the event of an invasion, double down on our support for Ukraine, and that means in terms of security assistance, economic assistance, diplomatic assistance, political assistance, humanitarian assistance, you name it,"" Blinken said.",45,5.008683177054785,4.349527830484821,0.659155346569964,4
2022-02-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/europe/analysis-russia-ukraine-crisis-intl/index.html,Russia blows past another off ramp in the Ukraine crisis,"For those watching the Ukraine crisis, February 20 was supposed to be a date to watch. The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics ended on Sunday, and some observers worried the closing ceremony might be a convenient moment for Russian President Vladimir Putin to launch military action. After all, history does rhyme: Russia escalated a brief conflict with Georgia in 2008 during the Beijing Summer Olympics, and Russia began its slow-rolling annexation of Crimea at the tail end of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. But Sunday also offered Russia a potential opening for de-escalation. After all, massive joint Russian military exercises in Belarus were slated to end on February 20, and the Kremlin had suggested Russian troops would go home after they finished, without giving concrete dates. Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei even said ""not a single"" Russian solider or piece of Russian military equipment will remain in Belarus once the drills ended. Instead, Russia blew past another potential off-ramp in the crisis. In a Sunday statement released by the Belarusian military on Telegram, Belarusian Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Viktor Khrenin said the Russians and Belarusians would continue their drills, saying the ""increase in military activity near the external borders of the Union State"" -- Russia and Belarus -- and the heightened tensions in Donbas necessitated the decision. Eyes remained on Donbas Sunday, as evacuees from separatist-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine continued to cross into southern Russia and from separatist-controlled regions, while reports filtered in of more shelling. Local officials in Russia's Rostov region have declared a state of emergency after separatist leaders on Friday ordered the evacuation of civilians from the region. But Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov laid blame on separatists in the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk republics for escalating the situation, accusing Russian-backed separatists of putting heavy weaponry in civilian areas and using it to bombard areas under Ukrainian government control. Meanwhile, the massing of Russian forces around Ukraine's borders appears to have continued, according to US intelligence estimates. A US official with direct knowledge of the intelligence told CNN Russia now has arrayed close to 75% of its conventional forces parked at Ukraine's doorstep, pointing to a high level of readiness to attack. So is diplomacy dead? Not entirely. Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone Sunday and ""agreed to continue to keep the dialogue open at various levels"" regarding the situation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said. A sticking point, however, remains the Minsk Agreement, which the Kremlin insists is the only way to resolve the crisis. But the Kyiv government sees it as a hastily devised agreement it was forced to accept at gunpoint. And Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesperson, had a word of caution for leaders engaging with the Russian leader by phone. Speaking to Pavel Zarubin, host of the TV program ""Moscow. Kremlin. Putin,"" Peskov suggested the Kremlin was prepared to disclose confidential discussions of high-level talks with other world leaders to counter what he described as deliberate and misleading leaks by foreign officials. ""I hope that we will not live in a world where we have to read out the transcripts of the closed part of the presidents' talks,"" Peskov said. ""But when it is necessary to prove the correctness of our president, we can and will do anything.""",4,2.7663144705087848,3.7690293467140523,-1.0027148762052676,15
2022-02-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/politics/blinken-ukraine-russia-cnntv/index.html,Blinken says Russia's 'playbook' for an invasion of Ukraine is moving forward but war can still be averted,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Russia's ""playbook"" for an invasion of Ukraine is moving forward, though he said there still is a chance for diplomacy to avert a war. ""As we've described it, everything leading up to the actual invasion appears to be taking place,"" Blinken said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. Ukraine's defense ministry reported more than 100 ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine on Saturday and said that shelling continued into Sunday, while Russian troops remain in Belarus to continue military exercises that were supposed to have concluded. Blinken told CNN's Dana Bash he was concerned that the extension of the exercises was another sign that Russia was setting the stage to invade, following ""false-flag"" operations this week and the accumulation of more than 150,000 Russian forces along Ukraine's border. ""Now they're justifying the continuation of 'exercises' that they said would end now, the continuation indefinitely of those quote-unquote exercises on the situation in eastern Ukraine -- a situation that they created by continuing to ramp up tensions,"" Blinken said. Still, Blinken said the US would continue to try to find a last-ditch diplomatic path. He said President Joe Biden is willing to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin ""at any time, in any format"" if it will help prevent a war, saying the Biden administration will continue to take whatever steps it can to try to convince Moscow not to invade Ukraine. ""We believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling, and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,"" Blinken said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was in Germany on Saturday, where he met with Vice President Kamala Harris at the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky said that he was urging the US and Europe not to wait to put in place sanctions against Russia, arguing that they wouldn't help Ukraine if they only were invoked after an invasion had already begun. Blinken said on Sunday that the US did not want to unveil the sanctions ahead of time because that would ""allow Russia to try and plan against them."" ""The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war,"" he said. ""As soon as you trigger them, that deterrent is gone and until the last minute, as long as we can try to bring a deterrent effect to this, we're going to try to do that."" Blinken said that if Putin goes forward with an invasion, the US and NATO have been clear they're ""going to come down on him and Russia very, very hard."" Asked if Putin could be bluffing, Blinken said, ""There's always a chance, but every indication that we've seen, every move that he's made, that has followed the play that we laid out for the world to see in front of the United Nations Security Council, he is following the script almost to the letter."" ""Everything we're seeing suggests that this is dead serious, that we are on the brink of an invasion,"" he added. But Putin still has options on the table if he chooses to take a diplomatic off-ramp to the tensions, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Sunday. ""We have made serious proposals and talked about changing, for instance, the scope and scale of some of our exercises in Europe, being willing to talk about offensive missile capabilities in Europe. We have certainly put forward other proposals to try to convince Mr. Putin ... that we're serious,"" Kirby told Fox. He also made clear the issue of Ukraine's membership in NATO, however, is ""an issue for Ukraine and for NATO."" ""That is not something that Mr. Putin can simply institute a veto over or decide for himself,"" he said. And the US would not recognize the ceding of Crimea or any other territory in Eastern Ukraine to Russia as a way to avoid war, Blinken told CBS' Margaret Brennan Sunday. ""No,"" the secretary said when asked on ""Face the Nation"" if the US would use that tactic as a diplomatic way to avoid a larger war. Meanwhile, President Sauli Niinistö of Finland, which shares a border with Russia, told Bash in a separate interview Sunday that Putin has ""behaved in a way which is very difficult to predict"". ""It's very difficult to say and define what the other person actually, deep down, is. But so far, I would say that he has behaved in a way which is very difficult to predict but that might be also intentional, namely to behave in that way, because that brings confusion to surroundings,"" Niinistö said. Blinken is scheduled to meet later this week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Europe, in what would be another round of diplomatic talks that have gone on for weeks as Russia's troops have continue to mass on Ukraine's border. But Blinken said the meeting would be called off in the event of an invasion. ""It all depends on what Russia does in the coming days,"" he said. ""If it doesn't invade, I'll be there.""",4,1.848033882214935,1.8196849350521807,0.028348947162754268,20
2022-02-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/19/europe/surprising-unity-in-europe-ukraine-crisis-intl-cmd/index.html,Vladimir Putin has succeeded in uniting his opponents,"As the world watches and waits nervously to learn if Russian President Vladimir Putin will instruct his forces to invade Ukraine, European diplomats are privately finding one small silver lining to the crisis unfolding in Eastern Europe. The European Union and NATO have been remarkably united during this entire episode, which months ago was in no way a certainty. Behind the scenes, diplomats, NATO sources and EU officials have praised the ""unprecedented levels of unity and coordination"" which has ""strengthened the transatlantic alliance"" as both institutions have worked in lockstep with each other and the US, as one EU official put it. A senior European diplomat working in NATO said they had been ""really surprised but thankful"" at the regular contact and cooperation between leaderships of both the EU and NATO which has allowed the messaging directed at Moscow to be ""coordinated and consistent at the highest diplomatic level, despite the cultural and geographical differences of all the stakeholders."" While the two institutions should on paper be natural partners, this level of unity was never certain. Relations between the two Brussels-based bodies have been strained in recent years. A particular low came in 2019, when President Emmanuel Macron of France -- the EU's biggest military power since the departure of the UK -- said that what ""we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO,"" arguing that Europe needed to start thinking of itself as a strategic, geopolitical power. Macron has been Europe's strongest proponent of what Brussels calls ""strategic autonomy,"" a catch-all term used to describe the EU's diplomatic independence from larger global powers like the US and China. A large part of this drive for autonomy has been the EU's growing differences with traditional allies like the US and UK over economic and political relations with countries such as Russia and China. Across the EU's 27 member states there are varying levels of reliance on Chinese investment and Russian gas. Some EU nations are relatively relaxed about friendly relations with Moscow as a matter of economic convenience, while others, particularly former Soviet nations, look at what is happening in Ukraine with greater concern and view Putin's Russia with a similar degree of skepticism to the UK and US. The EU has also made efforts to have a greater control of its own security -- including the ability to deploy troops in its own right. Last year, the bloc put forward plans for something called the ""Strategic Compass,"" a proposal that would give Brussels the centralized power to activate ""rapid deployment groups"" of up to 5,000 troops provided by member states to tackle specific issues. Not all member states were thrilled with the idea as they fear it would undermine the security provided by NATO, meaning the proposal could be watered down and practically ineffective. With that in mind, a crisis like the one in Ukraine could almost have been tailor-made to sow division within the EU in a way that would prohibit strong action such as hard sanctions against Russia -- and create an almighty headache when it came to working alongside NATO in a unified Western response. However, in the face of Russian aggression, the EU has been unusually united and has complemented NATO's hard line, officials say. Officials say the reason it's worked so well is because the EU has stuck to its strengths, as has NATO. One senior NATO official told CNN that the Ukraine crisis has been a ""litmus test"" for how the two should operate. ""NATO is a political and military alliance and can talk about bolstering defenses on Europe's eastern flank. The EU is more of an economic powerhouse that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the US when it comes to sanctions,"" the official added. NATO officials, who have in recent years been irritated by and privately dismissive of the EU and its global ambitions, have acknowledged that Brussels has played a role that no other body could match in the crisis. A senior NATO diplomat explained that the EU has quickly put together proposals for a package of support funds, sanctions against Russia and emergency gas supplies. ""We cannot do that, we don't have the authority, and without even the proposal the Western response would unquestionably have been much weaker,"" they said. However, for all the warm words and talk of ""blueprints for cooperation"" over Ukraine, both sides accept that once this crisis is over -- however long that might be -- a frost could return to two of the West's most important defenders of democracy. ""What's worked well in this case is a clear delineation of duties based on competences. Where it won't work in the future is where that line gets blurred. The EU has only decided it wants to be a security player very recently and has made some errors in this crisis,"" a NATO official said. Multiple sources pointed to the coordinated response to a letter sent by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to several countries, including the US, Canada and European nations, outlining Russia's security concerns. Brussels delights in pointing out that despite sending the letter to dozens of national governments, Lavrov got just two replies: from NATO and the EU. An EU official told CNN that they could ""not think of a better example of the two bodies coming together as partners than the coordinated response to Lavrov."" But the senior NATO official explained that they thought the EU ""wasted far too much effort in writing a response to a letter that had probably been dashed off in five minutes and was designed to cause disruption."" In that respect, the official believes the EU was ""naive"" and played into Russia's hands, as the coordinated response ""consumed attention here for weeks but ultimately achieved little."" The European diplomat said that this specific crisis has worked well because ""it has been handled at very high diplomatic and geopolitical level. Things like coordinated visits and visible meetings of leaders."" However they too are pessimistic that anything ""in the weeds like energy or cyber security"" will see a return to two institutions with contradictory interests. Indeed, those issues could even become factors in Ukraine. But any self-congratulation in European capitals may be premature. Obviously, the situation on the Russian-Ukrainian border continues to be stark and terrifying. Clearly, the Western response to date has only pacified Putin so far and things could still get very ugly. However, after years of private -- and sometimes public hostility, the EU and NATO have found a way to get on the same page at a time of great uncertainty for the West. And with numerous looming crises beyond Ukraine, that can only be a good thing.",4,2.297368850923514,1.5999637397049793,0.6974051112185347,26
2022-02-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/europe/ukraine-crisis-whats-next-intl-cmd/index.html,The Ukraine conflict is moving fast. Here's what to watch for,"Tensions in Ukraine are escalating. The country's eastern Donbas region -- where fighting between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces have simmered since 2015 -- experienced its worst shelling in years this week. And diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions have, so far, failed to reach a conclusion. As tensions continue to spike, here's some key moments to watch in the ongoing Ukraine crisis. Ongoing wargames and nuclear drills Over the past week, Russian President Vladimir Putin has focused international attention onto a series of military drills that have tested Russia's conventional military power. Russia's Ministry of Defense has released flashy footage of live-fire exercises in neighboring Belarus involving tanks, artillery and fighter aircraft, and the wargames have showcased Russia's air defenses and its navy. On Saturday, Russia is set to test its strategic deterrent: its nuclear forces. The Kremlin announced Friday that Putin is ""likely to be in the situation center"" during military drills on Saturday, where ballistic and cruise missiles will be launched. Three decades after the end of the Cold War, both Russia and the United States have nuclear arsenals on ""hair trigger"" alert -- that is, nuclear warheads married up to their delivery systems and ready for launch at a moment's notice. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov noted that such training exercises are ""quite regular,"" and would involve appropriate international notifications. That's true, up to a point: These readiness exercises are happening against the background of international tensions over Ukraine that could actualize into a major war. Tensions escalate in Donbas Tensions in Ukraine reached their highest in years on Friday after pro-Russian separatist leaders in the breakaway republics of Ukraine's Donbas region called on civilians to evacuate -- and after an explosion wrecked a vehicle in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, creating more war jitters. Ukrainian officials deny any plans to retake Donbas by force, saying that they see this week's incidents as an effort by Russia to create a pretext to launch an invasion. But Russian state media have already sounded the alarm, showing images of civilians departing Donbas on buses heading to Russia's Rostov oblast, just across the border. It is unclear how many civilians will be evacuated or if there will other incidents in Ukraine's east that Russia might seize on as a potential pretext for war. A diplomatic balancing act Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to attend the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, despite US President Joe Biden's administration plea to reconsider those plans to leave Ukraine amid concerns about a possible Russian invasion. It's possible that unexpected surprises could cut his visit short. The US and NATO make moves The US has already bolstered its military presence in eastern Europe; the US military announced a training mission in Hungary. How will the US and its allies react to the latest moves by Russia? Will we see more evacuations of diplomats remaining in Kyiv? Olympics end Russia has said its military drills are slated to end on Sunday, coinciding with the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Will the Olympics be remembered as a unifying international moment, or as a tragic preamble to war? That is anyone's guess.",4,3.7320626016492406,1.8088207878490894,1.9232418138001512,15

In remarks at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Harris laid out retaliatory measures in a manner befitting her past career as a prosecutor, promising ""significant and unprecedented"" economic costs. ""We will impose far-reaching financial sanctions and export controls. We will target Russia's financial institutions and key industries. And we will target those who are complicit and those who aid and abet this unprovoked invasion,"" Harris said as she took center stage at the security conference, which is taking place as the brewing conflict between Russia and Ukraine reaches a boiling point. The vice president continued, ""Make no mistake: The imposition of these sweeping and coordinated measures will inflict great damage on those who must be held accountable."" In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour Saturday after he met with Harris, Zelensky said any list of sanctions on Russia should be made public before an invasion of Ukraine occurs. ""We don't need your sanctions after the bombardment will happen and after our country will be fired at or after we will have no borders, or after we will have no economy ... why would we need those sanctions then?"" he said. In their meeting in Munich, Harris told Zelensky that the US ""takes seriously the importance of the integrity and the territorial integrity of Ukraine and your sovereignty, and the United States stands with Ukraine in this regard."" ""Any threats to your country we take seriously, and we have rallied our allies and our partners to speak with one voice,"" the vice president said. Harris' office said in a statement that Harris and Zelensky ""discussed the united Transatlantic approach if Russia further invades Ukraine, and the Vice President outlined the swift and severe economic measures that have been prepared alongside our Allies and partners."" Zelensky said he was grateful for the US support, particularly in bolstering Ukraine's defense capacity. ""This is our land and the only thing we want is to have peace, bring the peace back to our country,"" he said. Harris held additional meetings Saturday with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, according to a White House official. ""In each meeting, they discussed Ukraine, recent developments, and the united Transatlantic response. In particular, they discussed the swift and severe economic measures that the U.S., the EU, and others are poised to impose if Russia further invades Ukraine. They also discussed ongoing efforts at both deterrence and diplomacy,"" the official said. 'Until the very last minute' US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday said Russia was ""moving into the right positions to conduct an attack,"" and echoed President Joe Biden's assertion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had made up his mind on invading. ""They're uncoiling and now poised to strike,"" Austin said, speaking from Vilnius, Lithuania. Austin said the US would pursue a diplomatic solution ""until the very last minute, until it's not possible."" An attempt by international mediators to convene a meeting of Ukrainian and Russian representatives on the deteriorating situation in eastern Ukraine failed Saturday after the Russian delegation did not attend. The meeting was due to be held under the auspices of the Trilateral Contact Group, which is chaired by a representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Ambassador Mikko Kinnunen. The US intends to sanction elite Russian government officials and business leaders if Russia invades Ukraine, CNN has reported. Biden has said he would consider sanctioning Putin himself, but the administration has not revealed the names of those it is looking to sanction. Another option US lawmakers are weighing that would have major repercussions inside Russia is cutting the nation off from the global banking system. Russia could be removed from SWIFT, the high-security network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world. The move would make it nearly impossible for financial institutions to send money in or out of Russia, which would deliver a shock to Russian companies and their customers abroad. If Russia is cut off from SWIFT, senior Russian lawmakers have said shipments of oil, gas and metals to Europe would stop. A unified response Harris' remarks at the conference Saturday echoed repeated pledges from top US officials in recent days of a unified response to efforts by Russia to mount an invasion. A bipartisan delegation of 40 members of Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, was also in Munich in a show of solidarity with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ""Not since the end of the Cold War has this forum convened under such dire circumstances,"" Harris said. ""Today, as we are all well aware, the foundation of European security is under direct threat in Ukraine."" The vice president emphasized the importance of international organizations, institutions, laws and treaties that she reiterated have led to ""unprecedented peace, security and prosperity"" in Europe in the wake of two world wars. Harris stressed that at the heart of these defining principles is the belief that the sovereignty of nations must be respected, that nations have the right to choose their own governments and alliances, and ""national borders should not be changed by force."" ""In the face of Russian aggression, I have been reassured and heartened by the widespread agreement across the trans-Atlantic community that these rules and norms will be defended,"" Harris said. Ratcheting up the rhetoric, Harris accused Putin of feigning ""ignorance and innocence"" while simultaneously working to fabricate a false pretext for an invasion. Harris warned the ""playbook"" of Russian aggression is ""too familiar to us all."" ""We now receive reports of what appears to be provocations and we see Russia spreading disinformation, lies and propaganda. Nonetheless, in a deliberate and coordinated effort, we together are one, exposing the truth and two, speaking with a unified voice,"" Harris said. Harris emphasized the US maintains an ""ironclad"" commitment to Article 5 of NATO, which says that if any alliance member is attacked, every other member will consider it an attack against all members and will take any swift action to retaliate. ""We will not stop with economic measures,"" Harris said. ""We will further reinforce our NATO allies on the eastern flank."" Biden formally approved the deployment of 3,000 US troops to Poland, Germany and Romania in order to bolster NATO countries in Eastern Europe as tens of thousands of Russian troops are amassed along Ukraine's border. The President has stressed these troops will not be deployed to fight inside Ukraine and are instead there to show support to NATO allies feeling threatened by Russia's military moves. ""Today, the United States, our allies and our partners are closer together,"" Harris said. A high-stakes moment The vice president's emphasis on Russia-Ukraine tensions follows several efforts by the United States on Friday to publicize Russia's aggressive actions in the region and attempt to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine under the guise of false pretenses. Biden said that he is now convinced Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine, adding that the US believes Russian forces intend to attack Ukraine ""in the coming week"" or sooner and that an attack will target the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. It was a major rhetorical shift for the President, who had previously indicated that he believed Putin had not yet made up his mind about an invasion. Still, Biden emphasized on Friday, there was room for diplomacy. Russian misinformation is building up to a false justification for Putin to order an invasion, Biden said, accusing Russia of cease fire violations in the ""rapidly escalating crisis."" The White House on Friday also blamed Russia for a massive cyberattack on Ukraine earlier in the week and warned that Russia could face extensive sanctions if it invades Ukraine, with Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for international economics and deputy director of the National Economic Council, calling them ""the most severe measures we've ever contemplated against Russia.""

2022-02-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/19/world/power-display-ukraine-russia-intl/index.html,"A split-screen moment for the Ukraine crisis, with hard and soft power on display","The Ukraine crisis had a split-screen moment on Saturday, as the Kremlin put on a display of hard power and the Ukrainian president staged a charm offensive. Russian President Vladimir Putin led headlines first, as he oversaw a major test of the readiness of Russia's nuclear triad: The land-, sea- and air-based components of his strategic deterrent. In other words, the Kremlin leader got to brandish his nukes. The drills were a classic key-turning exercise: The Russians rehearsed the scenarios for ordering the launch of a nuclear strike, with crews launching intercontinental ballistic missiles, bombers dropping cruise missiles and a submarine firing a ballistic missile. It's meant to impress. Nuclear deterrence involves an element of theater, and Putin played the role to the hilt, watching the big screen inside the Kremlin situation room alongside his ally and close partner, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Russia's nuclear drills, in some respects, were the icing on the cake of massive military drills that have taken place over the past nine days. The Kremlin has presented those exercises -- in Belarus, on the Black Sea and in other parts of the Russian Federation -- as a major test for Russia's conventional armed forces. But the Biden administration and its NATO allies believe, with high confidence, that those exercises are a smokescreen for positioning troops to invade Ukraine. The United States estimates Russia now has 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine, including Russian-led separatist forces inside the Donbas region of Ukraine. But despite a warning from President Joe Biden that Putin has made up his mind to invade Russia's neighbor, Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky left his country to attend the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. Speaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Zelensky made it clear why he felt it urgent to leave the country as the Ukraine crisis reached a new peak. ""I'm the president, it's important for all our partners and friends to not agree about anything behind our back,"" he said. ""We're not panicking, we're very consistent that we are not responding to any provocations."" Officially, at least, Russian-Belarusian military maneuvers are set to finish on Sunday. But the US and the Ukrainians are on high alert for any sign of a provocation that Russia might use as a pretext for using military force. Those fears were driven home after the shelling of a Ukrainian kindergarten Thursday and when separatist leaders urged the evacuation of civilians from breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine. Not all is what it seems, however. A CNN analysis of the metadata of a video appeal by pro-Russian separatist leaders urging evacuation indicated the videos were in fact recorded days earlier. That, in turn, further cast doubt on separatist claims the Ukrainian government was planning a large-scale offensive against separatist-held territory. In his remarks Saturday, Zelensky nodded to the information war and praised his forces for restraint. ""We have a lot of provocations and we see them, we see this through the mass media, they're disseminating different provocative information, we need to preserve our stability, we need to keep calm and be adults,"" he said. ""In these times, Ukraine's army is more adult than others.""",4,1.6029514183391083,3.9374771669796367,-2.3345257486405284,15
2022-02-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/politics/treasury-banks-russia-cyber-meeting/index.html,US officials prep big banks and utilities for potential Russian cyberattacks as Ukraine crisis deepens,"Officials from multiple US agencies met Thursday with executives from big US banks to discuss how they might respond to Russian hacking threats as US officials warn that Russia could invade Ukraine at any time, five people briefed on the meeting told CNN. The meeting — which covered how to defend against potential Russia-backed hacking attempts against US financial institutions should the Biden administration sanction Russian entities — shows how US officials continue to see cyberspace as a domain of risk so long as the Ukraine crisis drags on. It comes as other critical infrastructure sectors, such as electric utilities, are on alert for any Russian activity. The meeting came as President Joe Biden and his top officials spent the day laying out dire warnings about the potential for a Russian invasion. With an estimated 150,000 Russian troops positioned around the Ukrainian border, it was a day that underscored palpable concern that the pathway to a diplomatic off-ramp was growing exceedingly narrow. Biden said Friday that he was convinced Russian President Vladimir Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine, but emphasized that room for diplomacy remains. The administration's warnings have coincided with efforts to lay the groundwork for an array of sanctions the US and allies have promised would be deployed in the event of Russian military action. Officials from the White House, Treasury Department, FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) attended the cybersecurity meeting Thursday, the people familiar with the meeting said. Executives from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which is the only US bank currently operating in Ukraine, were invited. ""We have good insight into Russian capabilities, or those of aligned actors, based on past actions, so we've approached this [process] with those in mind,"" one US official told CNN. US officials such as CISA Director Jen Easterly continue to say there are ""no specific credible threats to the US homeland' stemming from the Russian military's surrounding Ukraine. But officials are also preaching vigilance and, as CNN reported Monday, asking private executives to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious digital activity to the government. As US officials keep a close eye for any Russian hacking activity on US networks, they moved quickly on Friday to blame Russia's GRU military intelligence agency for a cyberattack that temporarily blocked access to the websites of Ukrainian banks this week. The banking sector got a lesson in the cyber risks that can come with geopolitics in 2012 and 2013, when, following Western sanctions on Iran's nuclear program, Iranian hackers overwhelmed the websites of dozens of US banks with phony traffic, costing tens of millions of dollars in lost business. The experience has loomed large in the minds of cybersecurity executives at US financial institutions, which have strengthened their defenses in recent years. Experts consider the financial and electric sectors two of the more mature in its cyber defenses. A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment on Thursday's meeting. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup declined to comment. A senior administration official told CNN that the White House and federal agencies have been preparing since November for ""any potential disruptions to our critical infrastructure and possible impacts to individuals and communities."" 'Tabletop exercises' The potential cyber threat has also featured in so-called ""tabletop"" exercises that have taken place inside the administration in recent months, as officials across the government have met to game out response possibilities that come with Russian escalation and potential invasion. ""We have created a process for agencies to quickly assess the impact of cyber [and] physical incidents and to inform the White House of the same,"" the official added. One tipping point that could trigger Russia-backed hacking against US organizations is if the Biden administration imposes the ""swift and severe"" sanctions that officials have been promising if Russia further invades Ukraine. US officials have sought input on potential market effects of any new sanctions, which officials have suggested would go further than any package prior, with potential targets ranging from financial institutions and networks to export controls designed to impair critical Russian economic sectors reliant on American software and equipment. As tensions in the last several days have ratcheted up to their highest level yet, the tempo of the work to plan for what may occur in the wake of sanctions being put into place, already at a high level, has also increased, one official said. Grid regulator tells utilities to be at 'highest possible level' of preparedness Federal officials and executives from key sectors like banking and energy have been keeping a close eye on any potential spillover effects from US-Russia tensions over Ukraine. Those preparations included an Energy Department briefing on the history of Russian cyber capabilities in December for America's largest utilities, and a previous classified briefing from Treasury for big banks, CNN previously reported. North American electric utilities should be at their ""highest possible level"" of preparedness for ""potential Russia-linked cyber and disinformation activity"" in light of US-Russia tensions over Ukraine, the North American grid regulator said in an advisory to the power sector this week obtained by CNN. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) -- a not-for-profit regulatory authority backed by the US and Canadian governments -- said it was unaware of a ""specific, credible threat to the North American electricity industry from Russia [or associated threat actors]."" But the regulator said it was making a ""proactive recommendation"" for the electric industry to be vigilant for any anomalous cyber activity. ""During these heightened tensions, NERC recommends that entities adopt the highest possible security posture for their most critical system assets and have response, mitigation, and staffing plans in place for this escalating conflict,"" NERC said. NERC regularly tracks various cyber threats and communicates with utilities about them. The electric sector has also in the last year deployed additional threat-detection tools on the more sensitive industrial control systems that help deliver power as part of a US government-backed initiative. ""If one of us gets punched in the face, all of us know about it,"" said Robert M. Lee, CEO of industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos, of the greater visibility of threats in the sector. US electric utilities and officials have also carefully studied cyberattacks in 2015 and 2016 that cut power in parts of Ukraine, and which the Justice Department later blamed on Russia's GRU. The Department of Energy and the Pentagon's research arm have in recent years hosted a series of drills for US grid operators to drill for mock cyberattacks modeled after the Ukrainian incident. Patrick C. Miller, the CEO and owner of Oregon-based Ampere Industrial Security, said the NERC alert was in that spirit of preparing for advanced cyberattacks. The Ukraine cyberattacks in 2015 and 2016 ""established the fact that power systems"" are now fair game for adversaries, Miller told CNN.",20,3.8109399033051314,5.7535766137088755,-1.942636710403744,2

""You know that we had a Security Council meeting today and Secretary Blinken openly asked our Russian counterpart, 'Tell us here, the Security Council, you do not intend to invade,' and they did not do that. So their intentions are very clear,"" UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" ""When they do it, will be their decision. But we need to be ready when it happens."" The United States says evidence at Ukraine's border shows that Russia is ""moving towards an imminent invasion"" and is not withdrawing troops, despite Moscow's claims. At the UN meeting Thursday, Blinken detailed US intelligence about Russia's attempts to fabricate a pretext for an invasion in an attempt to ""influence Russia to abandon the path of war and choose a different path while there's still time."" Moscow, Blinken said, was likely to try to generate a pretext for the war, which could be a fabricated terrorist bombing inside Russia, the invented discovery of a mass grave or a staged drone strike. Russia has repeatedly dismissed the notion that it is preparing to attack Ukraine as ""baseless accusations."" Thomas-Greenfield pointed to the 150,000 Russian troops near the Ukraine border, as well as troops in Belarus, as an indication that Russia is ""prepared for an attack any day."" ""They have put these troops on the border. We saw them do this when they invaded Crimea. We've seen them do it when they invaded other parts of Eastern Europe,"" she told Burnett. The comments from the UN ambassador and other top US officials -- including President Joe Biden, who gave a blunt warning Thursday that he believed an attack would happen ""within the next several days"" -- mark an even greater sense of urgency from the Biden administration that Russia's actions indicated the Kremlin was moving forward with plans for war. ""Every indication that we have is that they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine,"" Biden told reporters as he left the White House. Thomas-Greenfield stressed Thursday that the US will ""continue to aggressively lean in on diplomacy and hopefully succeed with a diplomatic solution."" If a Russian invasion doesn't occur, she said, it will be because of diplomatic efforts. ""We hope we are sitting across the table from them next week to have a discussion on a way forward, with their concerns on the table, our concerns on the table, and a way forward that does not lead to a confrontation,"" she said.",4,5.897647320938553,2.827058139858496,3.070589181080057,17

The restive eastern part of the country has witnessed the worst shelling in years over the last two days. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Friday that shelling of Ukrainian territory from areas controlled by separatists had risen dramatically in the past day. Each side accuses the other of heavy shelling of civilian areas. Ukrainian authorities say there were 60 breaches of the ceasefire Thursday, many of them by heavy weapons. The Ukrainian government denies that it is planning any offensive in the east, accusing the separatists of launching a ""disinformation campaign."" Authorities in the breakaway states of Donetsk and Luhansk said they were organizing the evacuations. Leonid Pasechnik, the most senior official in the pro-Russian breakaway Luhansk People's Republic, urged men to take up arms. ""The Russian Federation is ready to provide organized reception and accommodation on its territory of residents of the Luhansk People's Republic,"" said Pasechnik. ""Once again, I appeal to all men who are able to hold weapons in their hands, to defend their land."" Ukrainians accuse separatists of staging attack in breakaway city On Friday, a vehicle explosion in Donetsk was dismissed by Ukrainian and US officials as a staged attack designed to stoke tensions in eastern Ukraine. Video showed a fire in a parking lot and a badly damaged military vehicle, near the headquarters of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic. Images and video showed emergency services at the scene and a badly damaged vehicle identified by CNN as a Russian-made jeep. There's no way to verify what caused the damage to the vehicle or the fire. ""We think that this is a staging and a provocation,"" Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, told CNN on WhatsApp. A US State Department spokesman described it as a ""false flag operation"" and said incidents like the vehicle explosion and calls from separatist leaders to evacuate because of alleged Ukrainian aggression represented ""further attempts to obscure through lies and disinformation that Russia is the aggressor in this conflict."" US President Joe Biden has said that there has been an uptick in Russian disinformation that could be used as a pretext for an invasion into Ukraine. Speaking at the White House on Friday, Biden said that he was ""convinced"" Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine, but added that ""diplomacy is always a possibility."" Biden said reports pushed to the Russian public that Ukraine is planning to launch an attack in separatist-controlled Donbas lacked evidence. He said those claims defied logic. ""All of these are consistent with the playbook the Russians have used before,"" Biden said. He added: ""This is also in line with the pretext scenario that the United States and our allies and partners have been warning about for weeks. Both the Ukrainian government and western officials have warned of the possibility of provocative actions by Russia and the separatist leadership to provide a pretext for a Russian offensive into Ukraine. ""We are in the most dangerous phase,"" a Western official told reporters Friday. ""They could move at any time. Russia could act within days. Everything we are seeing makes us more concerned about that."" The official said there are 110 Russian battalion tactical groups -- a fighting formation that normally comprises about 1,000 troops -- around Ukraine. Russia also has ""air power ready to go,"" the official added. Both the Ukrainian government and western officials have warned of the possibility of provocative actions by Russia and the separatist leadership to provide a pretext for a Russian offensive into Ukraine. The Donbas region has seen fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatist fighters since 2014. The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserts the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic are in effect Russian-occupied. The self-declared republics are not recognized by any government, including Russia. The Ukrainian government refuses to talk directly with either separatist republic. Russian President Vladimir Putin has distributed around 600,000 Russian passports to inhabitants of breakaway regions in recent years, a move that observers have argued could set the stage for a Russian intervention in Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in Donbas since 2014. Ukraine says 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with most staying in the areas of Donbas that remain under Ukrainian control and about 200,000 resettling in the wider Kyiv region. A Russian invasion of Ukraine would be ""catastrophic,"" UN Secretary General António Guterres said Friday during his opening remarks at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, calling for diplomatic efforts to continue. ""I am deeply concerned about heightened tensions and increased speculation about a military conflict in Europe. I still think it will not happen but, if it did, it would be catastrophic,"" Guterres said. US Vice President Kamala Harris from the Munich conference warned that ""aggressive action"" by Russia would be met with ""severe consequences"" of economic sanctions. Biden administration officials have privately urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky not to leave Ukraine and visit Munich on Saturday given concerns about a possible incursion, according to three US officials and one senior Ukrainian official. Some US officials are concerned that if he leaves the country that could open the door for Russia to make false claims that he has fled. While officials haven't explicitly asked Zelensky not to make the trip -- and have been careful to make clear it's up to him -- those concerns have been communicated, one of the officials said. The latest US intelligence assessment indicates that Russia is continuing with preparations to invade Ukraine, according to a senior US official with direct knowledge and another source directly familiar with the intelligence. The assessment -- described as ""bleak"" by the senior official -- indicates Russia could attack in the coming days. Earlier assessments forecasting military action by Russia this week did not bear out.",4,3.9282470735870616,2.6485018558307054,1.2797452177563562,15
2022-02-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/politics/us-intelligence-assessment-russia/index.html,'Bleak' new intelligence assessment driving new urgency from Biden administration on Russia,"The latest US intelligence assessment indicates that Russia is continuing with preparations to invade Ukraine, according to a senior US official with direct knowledge and another source directly familiar with the intelligence. The assessment -- described as ""bleak"" by the senior official -- indicates Russia could attack in the coming days. The US still expects any Russian invasion to be prefaced by a false flag operation, another US official said. However, US officials caution they do not know if Putin has made a final decision to invade and note he may delay action or not order it at all. Earlier assessments forecasting military action by Russia this week did not bear out. The US has briefed the Ukrainian military on the newest assessment, according to a senior US official and a senior Ukrainian government official. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, pointed to recent actions -- including Russia adding ""leading edge forces"" to its troops on Ukraine's border -- to show that Russia's coercive tactics towards Ukraine are already in play. ""Everything that we're seeing, including what you've described in the last 24, 48 hours is part of a scenarios that is already in play of creating false provocations, of then having to respond to those provocations, and ultimately committing new aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken said. Blinken said what Russia has done in recent days has the US on alert. ""The facts are that despite what Russia has said in recent days about pulling back forces from the border, that has not happened,"" he said. ""On the contrary, we see additional forces going to the border, including leading edge forces that would be part of any aggression. So we have to be informed by that. We have to be extremely vigilant."" President Joe Biden warned Thursday that ""every indication"" leads him to believe Russia could invade Ukraine in the coming days. ""My sense is it will happen in the next several days,"" the President said the White House South Lawn. The US is now watching for signs that Russian preparations have entered the final stage, including the loading of amphibious ships and the further positioning of combat units closer to the Ukrainian border. Austin warns Russia is moving military as if 'they were preparing to launch an attack' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warned Friday that Russia is moving military elements as if ""they were preparing to launch an attack,"" he added, noting that NATO has observed Russia moving and dispersing troops near the Ukrainian border, and increasing its logistical capabilities in the region. The US also remains concerned that Russia may attempt to create a false pretext for invasion by staging attacks on its own territory or forces which it would blame on Ukraine or the West. Blinken laid out the range of potential scenarios before the US Security Council Thursday. ""Russia may describe this event as ethnic cleansing or a genocide, making a mockery of a concept that we in this chamber do not take lightly,"" Blinken said. Separately, the US has obtained intelligence suggesting that Russia deliberately misled the world when it announced earlier this week that some Russian forces would begin withdrawing from Ukraine's borders, according to two sources directly familiar with the intelligence. The Washington Post first reported on the intelligence about Russia's deliberate deception. Putin had said on Tuesday that Russia had decided ""to partially pull back troops"" from Ukraine's borders, and the Russian Defense Ministry released videos on Wednesday showing some forces and equipment leaving Crimea. But the US has evidence that Russia intended to deliberately deceive the West when it announced these drawdowns, the sources said, and has instead increased its troop presence and moved forces closer to the border in some areas. The sources declined to go into further detail about the evidence, citing the need to protect sensitive sources, but emphasized the information about Russia's deception was not solely based on their movements on the ground and was based partly on intercepted communications. And as CNN has previously reported, US officials are aware that Russian military doctrine explicitly embraces deception -- a concept known in Russian as ""maskirovka,"" or ""masking."" Administration officials indicated as much on Wednesday, when they told reporters that despite its announcements about a partial withdrawal, Russia had actually increased its troop numbers by approximately 7,000 forces. The officials said Putin's public openness to diplomacy was a guise. ""Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk, and make claims about de-escalation, while privately mobilizing for war,"" one of the officials said on Wednesday. Shelling has also dramatically increased in eastern Ukraine in the last day, which Ukraine has attributed to Russia-backed forces.",4,1.8525806558086604,1.849400371748862,0.0031802840597983106,20
2022-02-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html,What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained,"After months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Ukraine's border, Russia is ratcheting up pressure on its ex-Soviet neighbor, threatening to destabilize Europe and draw in the United States. Russia has been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep. The aggression has sparked warnings from US intelligence officials that a Russian invasion could be imminent. A whirlwind of diplomatic efforts in recent weeks has so far failed to defuse tensions in the region. The escalation in the years-long conflict between Russia and Ukraine has triggered the greatest security crisis on the continent since the Cold War, raising the specter of a dangerous showdown between Western powers and Moscow. So how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know. What's the situation on the border? More than 150,000 Russian troops now encircle Ukraine on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials. The White House has repeatedly warned that Putin could launch a full invasion of Ukraine at any moment. On February 21, Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what could be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation. The move has been condemned by Western leaders for violating international law and breaching Ukraine's territorial integrity. A day later, Putin said Russia's recognition of the DNR and LNR actually encompasses the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Currently the pro-Russian separatists currently only control around a third of those districts, but their independence claims include the entire areas. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning an assault, but an escalation in shelling in eastern Ukraine has heightened fears that it could be stoking the violence to justify a wider conflict. As the situation on Ukraine's border has intensified, NATO has raised the readiness of its rapid response force, while member countries put troops on standby and deployed battalions, planes and ships to the region. The US ordered 3,000 additional soldiers to be deployed to Poland, bringing the total number of reinforcements sent to Europe in recent weeks to about 5,000. The US says it has no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. The US has unveiled a ""first tranche"" of new sanctions against Russia, including on two large financial institutions, the country's sovereign debt, and Russian elites and their family members. Biden and European leaders have previously warned that Russia would suffer serious consequences should Putin move ahead with a wider invasion. But that has not stopped Russia from continuing to bolster its military positions. In late 2021 and early 2022, satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow's closest international ally. Despite receiving funding, training and equipment from the US and other NATO member countries, experts say Ukraine would be significantly outmatched by Russia's military, which has been modernized under Putin's leadership. If an all-out war broke out between the two countries, tens of thousands of civilians could die and up to 5 million could be made refugees, according to some estimates. What has set the stage for the conflict? Ukraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future -- crossing a red line for Russia. Putin has indicated he sees NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act."" In interviews and speeches, he has emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe. In early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. In the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create ""a pretext for an invasion."" What does Putin want? In a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people,"" and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia's orbit through a ""forced change of identity."" That type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin's emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine's own sovereignty. But Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West's ""puppet."" In fact, Putin's efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance. In December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe -- proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters. Putin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. ""It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,"" he said at his annual news conference late last year. ""Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep."" High-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe's leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine's east -- known as the Normandy Format talks -- could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis. In a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a ""genocide"" against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress -- echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea. But less than a week later, after Russia's upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements ""no longer exist,"" adding: ""What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?"" The agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 -- which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine -- have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved. Moscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and -- although unclear in what sequence -- would also restore the Ukrainian government's control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics. Putin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. ""Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,"" Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: ""We are not his."" What is Ukraine's view? President Zelensky has repeatedly downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. There's a similar mood in Kyiv, where Ukrainians have continued to go about their daily business, despite international warnings and as foreign governments withdraw their diplomatic staff from the capital. Elsewhere in the country, residents have been preparing for the worst -- packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists. Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN. Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked.

The President also said the US believes Russian forces intend to attack Ukraine ""in the coming week"" or sooner, and that an attack will target the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday said Russia was ""moving into the right positions to conduct an attack,"" echoing Biden's assertion that Putin had made up his mind on invading. ""They're uncoiling and now poised to strike,"" Austin said, speaking from Vilnius, Lithuania. Austin said the US would pursue a diplomatic solution ""until the very last minute, until it's not possible."" Biden plans to spend the weekend monitoring the ongoing Ukraine crisis from the White House as he meets with his national security team and remains in close contact with world leaders, multiple officials say. Biden had considered traveling to Delaware, as he typically does, but decided to remain in Washington. Vice President Kamala Harris was in Munich, Germany, where she warned of ""swift, severe and united"" consequences for Russia in the event of an invasion. Throughout recent days, the Biden administration has publicly disclosed several intelligence details on Russian movements -- a marked shift in how US national security officials typically operate. The administration's decision to discuss their movements ""loudly and repeatedly,"" Biden said Friday inside the Roosevelt Room, was made ""to remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving."" ""Make no mistake. If Russia pursues its plans, it will be responsible for a catastrophic and needless war of choice,"" he added. The President's assertion on Friday that he's ""convinced"" Putin has ""made the decision"" to invade Ukraine is a significant change in his position. Biden previously stated he did not believe the Russian leader had made up his mind, but acknowledged his insights into Putin's thinking were limited. He did note that he hoped diplomacy could de-escalate the situation, saying on Friday that ""diplomacy is always a possibility."" Questioned on why he believed Putin is considering diplomacy at all, Biden said only: ""We have a significant intelligence capability."" Biden said Friday that Russian misinformation is building up to a false justification for Putin to invade Ukraine, accusing Russia of ceasefire violations in the ""rapidly escalating crisis."" ""Over the last few days, we've seen reports of a major uptick in violations of the ceasefire by Russian-backed fighters attempting to provoke Ukraine in the Donbas,"" Biden said, pointing to multiple examples of disinformation that he said have been spread by Russian state media, including a ""phony"" claim of genocide in the Donbas region. Surprise revelation Biden had not initially been planning to announce during his speech Friday that he believed Putin made up his mind, and the revelation was not included in his prepared remarks. He only made his view known afterward when questioned by a reporter, answering at first only in the affirmative and declining to expand. He also made clear there is a diplomatic path to resolve the crisis, even as US officials believe it is growing narrower as signs mount of an imminent invasion. The determination that Putin has decided to invade Ukraine was made in part based on the latest intelligence assessments showing nearly half of Russian forces massed on the borders have moved into attack position, administration officials and people familiar with the matter said. Defense officials said Friday the number of battalion tactical groups had swelled to approximately 120-125, and that Russian forces were continuing to move toward the border. Biden's view of Putin's decision-making reflected those developments and the broader assessments of the intelligence community, an administration official said. The President cited ""a significant intelligence capability"" for his view of Putin's thinking, which he'd previously said was something of a mystery. Russian response Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova responded to Biden's comments, saying on her Telegram, ""The most monstrous thing is that there's not a word about the true state of affairs of the civilian population in the Donbas. No people, no problems?"" But the claims by the Russians simply don't make sense, Biden argued earlier Friday, saying, ""It defies basic logic to believe the Ukrainians would choose this moment -- with well over 150,000 troops arranged on its borders -- to escalate a year-long conflict."" In reporting Zakharova's comments, Russia's state news agency RIA-Novosti also said, ""The American president repeated the unsubstantiated thesis about Russia's alleged attempts to 'attack' Ukraine, threatening Moscow with sanctions in the event of an escalation. The Russian Federation categorically denies such statements and escalation plans attributed to it."" White House officials have warned that Russia could face extensive sanctions if it invades Ukraine, calling them ""the most severe measures we've ever contemplated against Russia."" Despite the US' assessment of an imminent invasion of Ukraine, Biden said that it's up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to decide whether he will attend this weekend's security conference in Germany. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to meet with Zelensky during the conference on Saturday. Earlier on Friday, the White House blamed Russia for a massive cyberattack on Ukraine earlier in the week. ""We believe that the Russian government is responsible for widescale cyberattacks on Ukrainian banks this week. We have technical information that links the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, as known GRU infrastructure was seen transmitting high volumes of communication to Ukraine based IP addresses and domains,"" said Anne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology. The attribution for the attack was unusually fast for the US government, and Neuberger noted that Russia has previously benefited from US delays in attributing Russian hacking operations. ""Russia likes to move in the shadows and counts on a long process of attribution so it can continue its malicious behavior against Ukraine in cyberspace, including pre-positioning for its potential invasion,"" Neuberger told reporters in the White House briefing room. Biden's speech on Friday comes amid escalating tensions in the region. Nearly half of Russian forces surrounding Ukraine are in attack position, according to a defense official familiar with the latest assessment. The number of battalion tactical groups has swelled to approximately 120 to 125. The official said the Russian military has continued to move forces toward the border, and within the last 48 hours, the number of forces in attack position has reached 40% to 50%. US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Michael Carpenter warned earlier Friday that the US has assessed a significant Russian military buildup near Ukraine just in the last two weeks. ""Russia probably has massed between 169,000-190,000 personnel in and near Ukraine as compared with about 100,000 on January 30,"" he said in a statement at the OSCE meeting. That includes Russian troops on the borders of Ukraine as well as the Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine, which have not been included in previous US assessments of Russia's strength in the area. Shortly before his remarks, Biden spoke with allies in North America and Europe. He will hold a phone call with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, the European Union and NATO to discuss the ongoing crisis. During the call, the leaders ""expressed deep concern"" about the situation and reiterated their support for Ukraine and discussed further economic assistance to the country, according to a White House statement. ""They pledged to continue pursuing diplomacy to de-escalate tensions while ensuring readiness to impose swift, coordinated economic costs on Russia should it choose further conflict. The leaders also discussed efforts to ensure the defense and security of NATO's eastern flank,"" the statement said. The President on Friday also called into a meeting the vice president was holding with members of Congress, who are all attending the Munich Security Conference in Germany and, according to a person in the room, he reiterated the work the US and allies have been doing to try to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine. He also updated the members on the situation at Ukraine's borders.

2022-02-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/politics/us-russia-ukraine-officials-list/index.html,US officials say Russia has list of senior Ukrainian officials it would remove if it invades,"Multiple US and western government officials tell CNN that the US has intelligence that Russia has drawn up lists of current political figures that it would target for removal in the event it invades Ukraine and topples the current government in Kyiv. Sources familiar with the intelligence say the target lists are part of Russian planning to replace the current administration in Kyiv with a more Russia-friendly government, bolstering a previous disclosure by the British government identifying pro-Moscow figures it said Russia planned to install. The most likely outcome for those politicians and public figures whom Moscow has targeted to be ousted in the event Kyiv falls, these sources say, is jail or assassination. ""We'll see what kinds of choices these people will be given, but a lot of them will be jailed or killed,"" said one source familiar with the intelligence. ""I think for most it will depend on how cooperative these people are when the time comes and the circumstances in which they are captured or taken."" ""If it's in public"" — in front of cameras — ""that'll be different, very different, from somebody who they corner in the middle of nowhere,"" this person added. CNN has not seen the underlying intelligence intercepts or the documents that name the targets or the purported collaborators and their supposed positions in a pro-Russia administration. And for now, the threat remains contingent on invasion, even as Russia has massed between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine, including Russian-led forces in breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. American officials have continued to escalate warnings that Russia is prepared to launch an invasion in Ukraine in the coming days — including a full-scale march on Kyiv — but they caution that they don't believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued the order yet. Putin's exact plans remain stubbornly difficult to determine. Western intelligence officials have closely watched for signs that Russia has prepared a friendly government-in-waiting as a key indicator of its intentions. ""As we've seen in the past, we expect Russia will try to force cooperation through intimidation and repression,"" said a separate US official. ""These acts, which in past Russian operations have included targeted killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, detentions, and the use of torture, would likely target those who oppose Russian actions, including Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists and anti-corruption activists, and vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons."" CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian government for comment. Foreign Policy first reported on the details of US intelligence on the Russian planning. Biden administration has aggressively releasing intelligence The revealing of the intelligence comes as the Biden administration has pursued a deliberate strategy of releasing as much intelligence as possible about what it knows about Russian planning on the Ukrainian border — even as it has declined to provide evidence of its claims, citing the need to protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods. Russia's goal in the event of an invasion, said the source familiar with the intelligence, would be to establish a friendly collaborator government that it can point to internationally as the legitimate government of Ukraine. And it has plenty of options to choose from, including political figures with dual citizenship, pro-Moscow politicians who fled to Russia after the 2014 democratic revolution, and friendly politicians who already hold seats in the Ukrainian parliament. ""They're going to establish a collaborator local government very quickly,"" the source said. ""And they have identified the individuals who need to go and who they want to replace them."" In late January, the British government accused Russia of seeking to replace Ukraine's current government with a slate of pro-Moscow politicians. According to the British Foreign Office, those pro-Russian figures included former Ukrainian lawmaker Yevheniy Murayev — the head of a small, pro-Russia party that currently holds no seats in Ukraine's parliament — and other Ukrainian politicians it said had links with Russian intelligence services. Still, even as the intelligence revealing Russian military movements on the border has been unambiguous — and largely public — western officials still don't know precisely what Putin's goals and intentions are. In part, Russia has objected to Ukraine's bid to join NATO and has demanded legally binding assurances from the alliance that it will not be allowed to join — an assurance NATO and the US has said they won't make. But Russia has also demanded a limit on the deployment of troops and weapons on NATO's eastern flank, and officials increasingly believe that Putin hopes to force a more expansive shift in the security architecture of the region. ""Every indication we have is they're prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine,"" President Joe Biden said on Thursday. Broadly, current and former intelligence officials say, Putin wants to ensure a pro-Russia Ukraine. There are a number of different ways he might achieve this goal short of full invasion: It's possible that he could try to use cyberattacks, the lingering specter of military action, and other grayzone tactics to destabilize the Ukrainian government from afar. But Biden administration officials have in recent days begun to warn that the most drastic option — an attack on the Ukrainian capital — is likely. ""Russian tanks and soldiers will advance on key targets that have already been identified and mapped out in detailed plans,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an address to the UN Security Council on Thursday. ""We believe these targets include Russia's capital -- Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million people."" Biden administration officials have also ramped up warnings that Moscow could deploy a false pretext to justify an invasion into Ukraine at any moment, citing an increase in false claims by the Russians in recent days. Blinken laid out what he described as Russia's plan to ""manufacture a pretext for its attack."" ""We don't know exactly the form it will take,"" Blinken said. ""It could be a fabricated so-called 'terrorist' bombing inside Russia, the invented discovery of a mass grave, a staged drone strike against civilians, or a fake -- even a real -- attack using chemical weapons."" ""Next, the attack is planned to begin,"" he said.",4,3.223540228650275,4.071371054269461,-0.847830825619186,19
2022-02-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/russia-ukraine-us-blinken-what-matters/index.html,The US makes its case against Russia,"Far from a de-escalation, the standoff between Russia and the US over Ukraine feels more tense each day. President Joe Biden warned on Thursday that an attack on Ukraine could come in days. The White House also accused Russia of conducting ""Potemkin diplomacy"" -- a reference to the 18th-century Russian ""Potemkin villages,"" facades without anything behind them. Fake diplomacy? That's because while Russia claims to be trying to defuse the situation and pulling back, the US is seeing evidence to the contrary and warns Russia could launch a false-flag attack -- something to essentially justify an invasion of Ukraine. Possible false-flag scenarios the US anticipates include: Claims of provocation in the Donbas region. A claim of NATO activity in land or air. Claims of an incursion into Russian territory. False claims about mass graves, chemical or biological weapons activity, guerrilla activity or genocide. LISTEN: Tensions rise over Russia-Ukraine conflict Making the case. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken went to the United Nations Thursday and laid out the American case. He told the Security Council that Russia is laying the groundwork to justify starting a war and preparing to launch an attack on Ukraine in the coming days. ""Here today, we are laying it out in great detail with the hope that by sharing what we know with the world, we can influence Russia to abandon the path of war and choose a different path while there's still time,"" he said. RELATED: US says Russia plans to manufacture justification for war Blinken then traveled to Munich for a global security conference, along with Vice President Kamala Harris. She will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and other European leaders. A sort of unity in the US. While the US mission is to convince world powers that Russia is the aggressor and line up support to hold the country accountable, the American politics of the Russia-Ukraine situation are different. Republicans and Democrats, for now, sound relatively unified. Praising Biden. Here's Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday talking about President Joe Biden's comments earlier in the week: ""(Biden) was right to emphasize that the world will not shrug or stand idly by if Vladimir Putin tries to invade his neighbor, or redraw the map of Europe through deadly force,"" McConnell said. He added that Biden would have ""overwhelming bipartisan support to use his existing executive authorities for tough sanctions against Russia in the event of conflict."" But there's a difference between bipartisan agreement and actual bipartisan action. Blaming Biden. While McConnell praised Biden and blessed his use of executive action, he blamed Biden for weakness in the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which he argued created a power vacuum. ""But for the catastrophe in Afghanistan, there's not a doubt in my mind -- not a doubt in my mind -- that the Russians wouldn't be on the border of Ukraine with 100,000 or more troops, had we not indicated to the rest of the world we were pulling the plug on Afghanistan and going home,"" McConnell told reporters Tuesday. A failed sanctions effort. Separately, lawmakers have so far failed to pass a bipartisan slate of sanctions against Russia. A sanctions bill likely won't pass before a Russian invasion of Ukraine, if one should occur. The House and Senate are both scheduled to be out of session next week around the Presidents Day holiday. The Senate, however, did approve a symbolic resolution condemning Russia Thursday evening. The resolution, which almost didn't make it to the floor after Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul objected to it, condemns Russia for its aggressive actions toward Ukraine. Still, there are several differences between the parties, in particular over: How to address the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, which Russia wants to install around Ukraine to pump natural gas into Germany. How to punish Russian bankers. Democrats argue the differences are technical. Here's Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, speaking on Capitol Hill Thursday: ""We actually have agreed on the package,"" Kaine told reporters. ""It's just that we have a different view on what should trigger the sanctions -- should we do it before an invasion or should we wait for invasion -- but both sides are together, Democrat and Republican, on what we will do."" A GOP proposal. Republicans in the Senate, while not agreeing to a bipartisan proposal, introduced their own sanctions bill Tuesday, which Democrats slammed as political posturing since it includes a lot of things that were in the bipartisan bill. The Republican bill is called the Never Yielding Europe's Territory (NYET) Act. NYET. Get it? It's Russian for ""no."" It would ""mandate sanctions"" on the Nord Stream 2 project ""without a waiver should Russia invade,"" a release about the Act said, and it would sanction Putin's ""cronies, enablers and major banks,"" along with providing $500 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine. Read more from CNN's Lauren Fox. Republicans like Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, who introduced the GOP bill, say if there is an invasion, a bipartisan sanctions bill will pass quickly. There are steps the White House is taking even without a sanctions package. On Monday, Blinken announced up to $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine. The US, under executive authority, will also double ""funding for US military exercises in Europe,"" and create a new State Department Foreign Military Financing program for Eastern Europe to ""help European allies strengthen their own defensive capabilities,"" according to a release. ""A new normal."" There may be plenty of time for Republicans and Democrats to come together on Russia and Ukraine. NATO's Stoltenberg told CNN on Thursday the West will have to live, on some level, with this more aggressive Russia. ""Regardless of whether Russia invades Ukraine or not, what we have seen so far I'm afraid represents a new normal because what we have seen is that Russia has been willing to amass large number of combat ready troops to try to intimidate and threaten Ukraine, but also try to threaten NATO allies,"" he said. Global coordination. Biden will convene a call on Friday with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, European Union and NATO to discuss the Ukraine crisis, a source familiar with the plans told CNN. A White House official told the pool, ""The President will speak with trans-Atlantic leaders on a phone call tomorrow afternoon about Russia's buildup of military troops on the border of Ukraine and our continued efforts to pursue deterrence and diplomacy.""

2022-02-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/europe/russia-military-video-intl-cmd/index.html,Russia says its units are going home after exercises near Ukraine. Evidence suggests otherwise,"Don't Trust -- Do Verify: That's the unofficial mantra from Western officials in response to Russia's declarations that some of their units that have been encircling Ukraine are now returning to base. Russia appears keen to prove those declarations to the world through well-produced videos distributed by the Ministry of Defense on Tuesday and Wednesday. In several of those videos, units from the Southern and Western Military Districts were said to be going back to base from Crimea after completing their exercises there. Traffic heading east across the bridge over the Kerch Strait included tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and fuel trucks, which supported the units. Filmed from multiple angles, the videos were designed to reinforce what the Kremlin has insisted all along: that an invasion of Ukraine is not and never has been on its agenda. ""Southern Military District troops, which have completed their tasks as part of planned tactical exercises at combined arms ranges on the Crimean peninsula, have begun to return to their permanent deployment points,"" the ministry said Tuesday. But two of the units leaving, according to Russian newpaper Izvestia, were elements of the 3rd and 150th Motor Rifle Divisions. They are based close to Ukraine at Rostov-on-Don and Belgorod respectively, a short drive from the border. When those units get home, they will be closer to Ukraine than they were in Crimea. Other Russian footage from Tuesday -- including drone shots -- showed the elaborate departure of T72 tanks from an unidentified rural area. CNN geolocated the location to a training ground near Otreshkovo, a Russian village some 120 kilometers (around 75 miles) from the border. But the direction the departing tank convoy was taking is far from conclusive. The video shows tanks heading in two different directions, both to a railway station and to the training ground. The next day, the defense ministry posted more video of the same unit being loaded onto a train -- and then later published another video of the train rumbling eastwards at night. Its destination is unknown. Russian diplomats have seized on the Defense Ministry's declared pull-back to accuse the West of hysteria in amping up the threat of an invasion. Russia's Ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov told German newspaper Die Welt on Wednesday that there will be no attack on ""Wednesday, next week, neither in the coming weeks, nor months."" For the United States and NATO, the jury is still out. US President Joe Biden said Tuesday the US assessed there are some 150,000 Russian forces surrounding Ukraine. NATO's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg concurred, saying, ""just that we see movement of forces, so battle tanks, doesn't confirm a real withdrawal. It has been a bit up and down, back and forth all the way. But the trend over the last weeks and months has been a steady increase in the Russian capabilities close to Ukraine's borders."" CNN -- along with a number of independent experts -- continues to monitor and geolocate social media content emerging from Russia and Belarus that show its military on the move. The evidence to hand is that plenty of Russian armor remains close to the Ukrainian border -- and some of it is still moving closer. On Wednesday, T90 tanks were filmed moving through slush in Tomarovka, a village in the Belgorod region of Russia just miles from the Ukrainian frontier, according to multiple videos reviewed. In the nearby, village of Veselaya Lopan, satellite imagery shows a new temporary military camp. And in the past week, more helicopters -- for both combat and transport -- have arrived both in Crimea and in areas close to Ukraine's eastern border, according to satellite imagery reviewed by CNN. Those helicopters would provide important air support to any ground offensive. New satellite imagery also shows a curious development in southern Belarus, around six kilometers (approximately four miles) from the Ukrainian border and also close to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. A long pontoon bridge has been built in the last few days across the River Pripyat, not far from where Belarus and Russian forces are carrying out extensive joint exercises. While there is little military activity in the immediate area, the bridge would dramatically cut the time needed to reach the Ukrainian border and avoid population centers. An additional satellite image from Planet Labs also shows that after January 8, a new road was constructed that leads to the bridge. Western intelligence and military officials are closely tracking the construction as part of the support infrastructure Russia is putting in place in advance of a potential invasion, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Still, past exercises in the area have included the construction of pontoons, highlighting a well-known dilemma in intelligence capture: how to reconcile growing and changing capabilities with unknown intent. Another as yet unexplained development: Maxar had previously observed the establishment of a large detachment of Russian forces - including tanks - near the town of in south-eastern Belarus, some 30 miles from the border. Those forces appear to have dispersed, Maxar says, noting that a ""military convoy was seen moving west on today's imagery."" Analysts say it will take at least several days to establish whether there is a true drawdown of Russian forces from temporary positions around Ukraine, or whether -- as many western officials believe -- it's more maneuvering. The Conflict Intelligence Team, which has long experience tracking Russian military movements, told CNN: ""We are currently unable to either confirm or deny any actual withdrawal happening. We've seen vehicles of the 58th army of the Southern Military District being loaded on trains in Crimea (where they had previously deployed unannounced), but we would need some additional time and evidence to say if they are actually withdrawing to their permanent bases."" Konrad Muzyka, an analyst at Rochan Consulting, an aerospace and defense consultancy said in a tweet, ""Previously announced withdrawals meant more Russian troop deployments near Ukraine. New trains with equipment keep on arriving. The withdrawal would be a welcome development, but recent history tells us these announcements are not genuine. Need a few days to verify."" In January and early February, dozens of social media videos showed Russian forces heading towards Ukraine's borders nearly every day. So far, there's been no similar surge of content showing those forces moving in the opposite direction.",7,3.8550747334473567,3.0474209663409066,0.8076537671064501,16
2022-02-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/us-russia-ukraine-thursday/index.html,US says Russia plans to manufacture justification for war,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia was laying the groundwork to justify starting a war and preparing to launch an attack on Ukraine in the coming days, urging Moscow to change course at a tense United Nations Security Council meeting Thursday. Blinken changed his travel plans so he could speak Thursday's UN meeting, where the top US diplomat said he was detailing US intelligence about Russia's attempts to fabricate a pretext for an invasion in an attempt to ""influence Russia to abandon the path of war and choose a different path while there's still time."" ""I am here today not to start a war, but to prevent one,"" Blinken said. The United States says evidence at Ukraine's border shows that Russia is ""moving towards an imminent invasion"" and is not withdrawing troops, despite Moscow's claims. The comments from Blinken and other top US officials Thursday -- including President Joe Biden's blunt warning that he believed an attack would happen ""within the next several days"" -- marked an even greater sense of urgency from the Biden administration that Russia's actions indicated the Kremlin was moving forward with plans for war. ""Every indication that we have is that they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine,"" Biden told reporters as he left the White House on Thursday. Russia once again dismissed the notion it was preparing to attack Ukraine as ""baseless accusations."" In his address to the Security Council, Blinken laid out several steps the US expected Russia to take in the coming days in an attempt to justify military action in Ukraine. He said Moscow was likely to try to generate a pretext for the war, which could be a fabricated terrorist bombing inside Russia, the invented discovery of a mass grave or a staged drone strike. ""Russia may describe this event as ethnic cleansing or a genocide, making a mockery of a concept that we in this chamber do not take lightly,"" Blinken said. Blinken said that top Russian officials were likely to hold urgent meetings before an attack that would include Russian bombings across Ukraine and cyberattacks. Blinken said the US believes Moscow has already selected targets that Russian tanks and troops would advance on, including Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Blinken acknowledged ""that some have called into question our information,"" nodding to past problems with US intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq War. But he said the US would be relieved if it's predictions are proven incorrect and Russia changes course. ""The information I presented here is validated by what we've seen unfolding in plain sight before our eyes for months,"" Blinken said. ""Remember that while Russia has repeatedly regarded our warnings as melodrama and nonsense, they've been steadily amassing more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders."" Russia accuses US of making 'baseless accusations' Russian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey Vershinin, who spoke before Blinken at Thursday's Security Council meeting, warned others about making the UN meeting a ""circus,"" saying they should not present ""baseless accusations saying that Russia allegedly was going to attack Ukraine."" ""We have long ago clarified everything and explained everything. And the announced date of this so-called invasion is behind us, so therefore ... my advice to you is [to] not present yourself in an awkward situation,"" Vershinin said. On Thursday, the US received a response from Russia to the written proposals the US submitted to Russia three weeks ago, a senior State Department official said. In an 11-page document published by state news agency RIA-Novosti, Moscow said the US did not provide a constructive response and that ""the increasing US and NATO military activity close to Russian borders is alarming."" ""It's about giving up the further expansion of NATO,"" the response said. As tensions continued to ratchet up, the State Department said Thursday that Russia expelled the second-most senior diplomat at the US embassy in Moscow without any justification, in what the Biden administration views as an escalatory move. Gorman departed Moscow last week, according to a senior State Department official. He was expelled by Moscow earlier this year and given two weeks to depart. ""Russia's actions against our deputy chief of mission, who was a key member of the embassy's leadership team, was unprovoked,"" White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""Now more than ever, it is critical that our countries have the necessary diplomatic personnel in place to facilitate communication between our governments.""addressing the UN because ""this is a crucial moment."" ""The evidence on the ground is that Russia is moving towards an imminent invasion,"" she said. ""Our goal is to convey the gravity of the situation,"" she said. Blinken said that he proposed in a letter a meeting next week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Europe to continue diplomacy, along with meetings of the NATO-Russia council and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. US says Russian still adding troops and capabilities on Ukraine's border US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Thursday also said the US government is not seeing any kind of withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's border, instead seeing Russia adding to its capabilities and troops ""even in the last couple of days."" During a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Austin said the US is seeing Russia move some troops closer to the border, fly in more combat and support aircraft, stock up on blood supplies and ""sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea."" ""I was a soldier myself not that long ago, and I know firsthand that you don't do these sort of things for no reason, and you certainly don't do them if you're getting ready to pack up and go home, so we and our allies will stay vigilant,"" he said Thursday. Russia has rockets and artillery arrayed in a way that can target cities and other concentrated population areas, according to a US official. The US has been flying aerial surveillance over Ukraine for some time now, using a combination of RC-135 Rivet Joints and RQ-4 Global Hawks, as part of its intelligence gathering efforts. Those flights have continued, even as concerns of an invasion have grown. Echoing comments from Biden and other administrations officials, the US official said the Russians have everything in place to conduct a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, far more than is needed if the goal was only to target the Ukrainian military. The official did not say Putin has made a final decision to invade and noted he could call troops back any time he wants, but warned, ""Everything we see speaks to intent."" In trying to figure out Putin's next move, the US is looking at the total environment in eastern Europe -- from renewed fighting in Donbas to the false flag operations to the Russian disinformation campaign -- and comparing that to the latest intelligence to connect those elements as a possible pretext for an invasion. But it is imprecise work and not possible to draw out an absolute conclusion about whether or when Putin will move in. Still, there is growing confidence in Putin's eventual move. The official said the US is seeing preparations that already show the ""intentions to do military operations."" In eastern Ukraine, monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported a sharp escalation in ceasefire violations along the frontlines dividing Ukrainian and separatist forces. Both Ukrainian armed forces and separatists controlling parts of eastern Ukraine spoke of renewed shelling in the region early Thursday. Video and images confirmed by CNN show that a kindergarten in Ukrainian-controlled territory was hit by a shell Thursday. In a statement on Twitter, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said the village of Stanytsia Luhanska ""was shelled with heavy weapons from the occupied territory of the Donbas. Kuleba accused Russian-backed separatists of using a tank to carry out artillery fire in eastern Ukraine. Speaking alongside his British counterpart, Liz Truss, the Ukrainian foreign minister accused Russia of spreading disinformation to blame Ukraine. ""These shells came from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, which are controlled by Russia,"" Kuleba said in Kyiv. Top officials gather in Munich NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier Thursday that NATO allies are concerned that Russia is attempting to ""stage a pretext"" for an armed attack against Ukraine. He added that NATO has observed ""false flag operations"" in Ukraine by Russian intelligence officers to ""provide an excuse for invading Ukraine."" ""We don't know what will happen, but what we do know is that Russia has amassed the biggest force we have seen for decades in and around Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said. Amid the tension between Russia and the West, US, NATO and European officials are converging in Munich for an annual conference to address global security issues. Russia is not planning to attend. Vice President Kamala Harris is leading the US delegation that includes Blinken to the Munich Security Conference, and plans to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Stoltenberg during the trip. Austin has also been traveling this week, meeting with other defense ministers of NATO to discuss Russia's military buildup, before he heads to Poland and Lithuania to meet with the country's leaders and US troops.

But the images of a shelled kindergarten in eastern Ukraine shifted international focus to the Donbas region, where the world braced itself for signs that the simmering conflict there might escalate very seriously and catastrophically. Thankfully, the shell that hit the Stanytsia Luhanska school took no lives. But they were a reminder of the very real stakes for people living near the Line of Contact that separates Ukrainian government forces from Russian-backed separatists. For weeks, world leaders have been shuttling back and forth to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and making high-level phone calls to try to put the brakes on a confrontation between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis. Yet in Moscow today, there's been no signs of a breakthrough, but a clear ratcheting up of tension. On Thursday afternoon local time, US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan paid a visit to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he received a long-awaited response from the Russian government to a written document delivered to Russia three weeks earlier. The document made clear that the Russians laid full blame on the US and its allies for stoking the Ukraine crisis, even as evidence continues to mount of that as many as 150,000 Russian troops are arrayed around Ukraine's borders. ""There is no plan for a 'Russian invasion' of Ukraine, as the U.S. and its allies have been alleging at the official level since last Autumn,"" the document, released by Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti said. ""Therefore, claims about 'Russian culpability for the escalation' cannot be interpreted as anything other than an attempt to pressure and devalue Russian offers of security guarantees."" At about the same time, the US State Department confirmed Russia had expelled the second-most senior diplomat at the US diplomatic mission in Moscow, a move that US President Joe Biden's administration called an ""escalatory"" step. That escalation has clearly been incremental: A senior State Department official said that Bart Gorman, the US deputy chief of mission in Moscow was formally expelled by Moscow earlier this year, given two weeks to depart and left Moscow last week. So where does that leave diplomacy? It's still not entirely dead. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met on Thursday with his Italian counterpart, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. Lavrov essentially laid out the same complaint that was in the written reply delivered to the US: The Americans and NATO have ignored Russia's core security concerns, he said, and none of the secondary issues -- on the technical details of arms control, for instance -- can be resolved ""until we agree on our key positions."" And on those key positions, particularly regarding the issue of who can join NATO, Russia and the West remain very, very far apart.",4,2.1451698818837084,3.6085666775375946,-1.4633967956538863,17
2022-02-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/us-russia-defense-contractors-hackers/index.html,US says Russian hackers have collected intelligence from American defense contractors,"Russian government-backed hackers have acquired sensitive information on the development and deployment of US weapons by breaching American defense contractors over the last two years, US security agencies said in a public advisory on Wednesday. The information gathered is unclassified, but offers ""significant insight into US weapons platforms development and deployment timelines,"" and also covers export-controlled technology, according to the FBI, National Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). It's one of the clearest public statements yet from the US government on how Kremlin-linked hackers have gathered intelligence on US defense contractors — a problem Washington has faced for years. The intrusions hit contractors supporting every US military branch, including the Air Force, Army, Navy and Space Force, as well as firms that work on defense and intelligence programs, US officials said. The advisory comes as US officials warn Russia against further invading Ukraine, along whose border Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops, according to US President Joe Biden. US government agencies have for years regularly released information on state-sponsored hacking threats, and US officials continue to say there is no credible, specific cyber threat to the US homeland tied to the Ukraine crisis. Contractors targeted by Russian hackers over the last two years have been involved in aircraft design and the development of combat and weapons systems, among other things, the US agencies said. ""By acquiring proprietary internal documents and email communications, adversaries may be able to adjust their own military plans and priorities, hasten technological development efforts, inform foreign policymakers of US intentions, and target potential sources for recruitment,"" the advisory says. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the US advisory. Russia routinely denies allegations that it conducts hacking operations. ""Both the United States and Russia are continually probing, through cyber, to pick up information on weapons systems, on intelligence, etc.,"" Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday when asked about the new US advisory. ""The compromise of intelligence information is [on] both sides,"" said Reed, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""And I think we're very well prepared with our cyber operations to assist the Ukrainians."" Reed said that the US generally has a ""very active cyber operation against Russia. That was demonstrated ... before the 2020 elections, when we literally took out some Russian sites who we knew were interfering with our election."" President Joe Biden said at a January 19 news conference that the US could respond with hacking operations of its own to further Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine. US officials have been publicly and privately advising US critical infrastructure firms for weeks to check their networks for potential Russian hacking threats. Reed said that US Cyber Command, the military's hacking and cyber defense unit, ""is on full alert"" in the event of any escalation from Russia in cyberspace. US spy agencies have long used cyber tools to collect intelligence on rival powers such as Russia and China. The US National Security Agency looked for ways to exploit products made by Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, The New York Times reported in 2014, citing classified documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

2022-02-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/russian-troops-biden-administration/index.html,"US says Russia has added 7,000 troops along Ukraine border, despite claims of pullback","Russian forces massed along Ukraine's borders have increased by approximately 7,000 troops in recent days, the United States alleged Wednesday evening, despite claims from Moscow it was pulling back. A senior US administration official said the increase renders Russia's assertion of withdrawal ""false,"" and warned President Vladimir Putin's public openness to diplomacy was a guise. ""Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk, and make claims about de-escalation, while privately mobilizing for war,"" the official said. The new estimates would place the number of Russian forces north of the 150,000 figure President Joe Biden cited in a televised address earlier this week. Western leaders had already greeted Russia's claims of withdrawal with skepticism. On Tuesday, Biden said during a speech in the East Room that a withdrawal of Russian troops would be ""good,"" but that he had yet to see any evidence that such a pullback was underway. ""Our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position,"" Biden said. ""And the fact remains right now Russia has more than 150,000 troops encircling Ukraine and Belarus and along Ukraine's border."" The senior official again warned Russia could use a false pretext for an attack, including making claims about NATO activity or an incursion into Russian territory, or alleging atrocities were occurring in the eastern Donbas region, which has been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. ""We should expect more false reports from Russian state media over the coming days,"" the official said. ""We don't know what form the false pretext will take. But we hope the world is ready."" The announcements, delivered on an early evening briefing call, painted a stark picture as the US and Europe wait on tenterhooks for Putin to signal his intentions. American officials have said the window is open for a potential invasion but that the enigmatic Russian leader will still need to make the final decision. A day earlier, Biden had seized on signals from Moscow that it is willing to resume negotiations, saying there was ""plenty of room for diplomacy."" But the official speaking a day later largely discounted those prospects while still saying talks would continue. ""We will continue to pursue diplomacy over the coming days while being prepared to respond swiftly and decisively,"" the official said. ""Russia keeps saying it wants to pursue a diplomatic solution; their actions indicate otherwise. We hope they will change course before starting a war that will bring catastrophic death and destruction."" On Tuesday, Putin claimed Russia was sending some troops back to base after completing drills in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014. But US and European leaders uniformly cast doubt on the claim. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had not yet seen ""any sign of de-escalation on the ground,"" but added that ""signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue"" were grounds for cautious optimism. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told a news conference in Kyiv that he was abiding by a rule when it comes to Russian claims: ""Do not hear and then believe. But do see and then believe."" And US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a morning interview Wednesday there is ""a difference between what Russia says and what it does."" ""What we're seeing is no meaningful pullback,"" Blinken told ABC News. This story has been updated with more reporting.",4,3.524208067306151,2.21613221843873,1.308075848867421,20
2022-02-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/europe/ukraine-russia-news-wednesday/index.html,"Russian buildup continues, but insufficient for full-scale invasion, Ukrainian military intelligence says","Russia's buildup of troops at Ukraine's borders has persisted, despite Moscow's claims of a drawdown, but the number of Russian forces remains insufficient for an invasion, according to a Ukrainian intelligence report shared exclusively with CNN. The total number of Russian troops at the border has increased in recent days to more than 148,000, including more than 126,000 ground troops, the report says, echoing US intelligence about the build-up. A Ukrainian presidential spokesperson affirmed the reporting in comments to CNN ahead of an address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was sending some of its troops at the border back to base after completing exercises. On Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg rejected Putin's claim and said the military buildup was continuing, describing it as ""the most serious crisis in decades."" A statement by NATO later on Wednesday said the buildup was ""very large scale, unprovoked and unjustified."" NATO also said it was deploying additional land forces in the eastern part of the alliance, in addition to maritime and air assets. The measures, the statement said, remained ""proportionate"" and ""non-escalatory,"" in response to the ""serious threat"" of the Russian troop buildup. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said that there was ""no meaningful pullback."" ""Unfortunately there's a difference between what Russia says and what it does. And what we're seeing is no meaningful pullback,"" Blinken said on ABC's Good Morning America. ""On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border,"" he said. The US alleged on Wednesday evening that Russian forces massed along Ukraine's borders have increased by approximately 7,000 troops in recent days, with a senior US administration official saying the increase renders Russia's assertion of withdrawal ""false."" The official said that Putin's public openness to diplomacy was a guise, saying, ""Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk, and make claims about de-escalation, while privately mobilizing for war."" According to the new Ukrainian intelligence report, 87 Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) are on constant alert around Ukraine, up from 53 which are usually based in the area. BTGs are formations that consist of 800 to 1,000 Russian troops. The numbers are consistent with the latest US assessment of the Russian troop buildup, but deviates from Western statements by playing down the threat of a full-scale invasion. ""The Russian military contingent near the Ukrainian border is insufficient to carry out a successful large-scale armed aggression against Ukraine,"" the report said. Instead, Ukrainian intelligence believes that Russia has focused its efforts on ""destabilizing Ukraine's internal situation"" using punitive economic and energy-related tactics, as well as cyberattacks. Largest cyberattack of its kind A high-volume cyberattack that temporarily blocked access to the websites of Ukrainian defense agencies and banks on Tuesday was ""the largest (such attack) in the history of Ukraine,"" according to a government minister. Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who is also the minister of digital transformation, added that it is too early to tell who was responsible for the attack. The so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack -- which bombarded Ukrainian websites with phony traffic -- was coordinated and well planned, officials said. DDoS attacks often disrupt access to IT systems, but their impact can be more psychological rather than having any direct effect on a country's critical infrastructure. 'Day of Unity' Meanwhile on Wednesday, Ukraine marked a so-called ""Day of Unity"" -- called for by Zelensky -- as a show of defiance against Russia. Hundreds of people observed flag-raising ceremonies in some of Ukraine's city centers. ""This gathering is how we show our power to Putin,"" Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy told CNN. Speaking from the port city of Mariupol, which is believed to be vulnerable to attack in the case of an invasion, Zelensky vowed to ""not succumb"" to Russian provocations. ""We are not intimidated by any predictions (of war), any people, enemies, or any dates, because we will defend ourselves, whether it's February 16th, 17th, or 18th -- in March or April or September or December,"" he said. ""What's important is this is the year 2022, not 2014. We've become much stronger,"" Zelensky added, referring to Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Ukraine blamed Russia for Tuesday's cyberattack. Authorities have only raised the possibility that Moscow could have been behind the incident.",4,3.7506443248107537,1.6672983428956583,2.0833459819150955,20

The so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack -- which bombarded Ukrainian websites with phony traffic -- was coordinated and well planned, officials said. DDoS attacks often disrupt access to IT systems, but their impact can be more psychological rather than having any direct effect on a country's critical infrastructure. While down for parts of Tuesday, the websites of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces, and those of two prominent banks, were back up Wednesday, according to CNN journalists in Ukraine. The DDoS attack, however, is ongoing, Ukrainian officials said. The incident comes as Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops close to Ukraine's border, according to US President Joe Biden, and as US officials warn that a fresh Russian invasion could come at any time. Russia has denied it is planning to invade Ukraine. The US government is investigating the cyberattack on Ukrainian websites, a top State Department official said Wednesday, while suggesting that Russia has a history of carrying out such hacks. ""But who is best at this, who uses this weapon all around the world? Obviously, the Kremlin,"" Undersecretary of State Toria Nuland said on CBS This Morning. ""While we're still investigating and doing forensics along with the Ukrainians, I think what's most important is that these cyberattacks were not very successful,"" Nuland said. She credited Ukrainian officials for responding quickly and helping the websites recover. Internet traffic hitting Ukrainian websites during the DDoS attack was ""three orders of magnitude more than regularly observed traffic,"" according to data collected by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. Ninety-nine percent of the traffic involved a type of digital request to computer servers, ""indicating the attackers were attempting to overwhelm Ukrainian servers,"" said Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike's senior vice president of intelligence. A Ukrainian intelligence report recently obtained by CNN pointed to Russia's effort to destabilize ""Ukraine's internal situation by using economic, energy, information, cyber, social, ethnic, and other tools."" Ukraine has concluded that Russia and Belarus were responsible for a separate cyberattack that hit government websites last month. ""As a result of a massive hacker attack on the night of January 14, 2022, the web pages of the Government of Ukraine"" were shut down. The attacks were carried out by a group affiliated with the Russian and Belarusian special services,"" the Ukrainian intelligence report said. Similarities in the infrastructure used in Tuesday's DDoS attack and the one last month suggest the incidents could be connected, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday. In mid-January scores of Ukrainian government websites were targeted in a cyberattack with threatening text warning Ukrainians to ""be afraid and wait for the worst,"" and alleging their personal information had been hacked. Ukraine claimed Russia was most likely behind the attack, which affected the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies.",20,3.1758573569784216,6.014230049323482,-2.83837269234506,2

""On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border,"" Blinken said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" On Tuesday, Moscow claimed that some of its troops were moving away from the border of Ukraine, but multiple US and Western officials have said that while they would welcome such a move, they have yet to see this happen. US officials have maintained the Russia retains the ability to invade its neighbor at any moment, including as soon as this week. ""We have heard signs from Moscow about readiness to continue diplomatic efforts, but so far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground. On the contrary, it appears that Russia continues the military build-up,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday. US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Toria Nuland underscored that their concern ""is that the troops that matter, those that are ringing Ukraine to the north, to the east, and to the south are actually increasing their readiness, so he is maintaining every option to go in at a time of his choosing."" Blinken said Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""could pull the trigger."" ""He could pull it today. He could pull it tomorrow. He could pull it next week. The forces are there if he wants to renew aggression against Ukraine,"" the top US diplomat said. However, a Ukrainian intelligence report obtained by CNN showed that the government in Kyiv does not assess the current Russian troop build-up is enough to carry out ""a successful large-scale armed aggression against Ukraine."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has consistently expressed far less alarm publicly about the potential imminence of an invasion, in contrast to officials from the US. Zelenzky 'trying to maintain calm' Blinken said Wednesday that he believes Zelensky is taking the threat ""very seriously."" ""He's trying to maintain calm. He doesn't want his people to panic. That's the right thing to do,"" Blinken said on ABC. ""But I think the Ukrainians are taking it very seriously. And of course, if there is renewed aggression by Russia, the consequences would be terrible, and first and foremost terrible for the Ukrainian people. So he recognizes that,"" he said. Moscow has consistently denied it intends to invade neighboring Ukraine, and on Wednesday Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was ""positive"" that President Joe BIden wants to continue diplomacy. In remarks at the White House Tuesday, Biden said he believed the door for diplomacy remains open, saying the countries ""should give the diplomacy every chance to succeed and I believe there are real ways to address our respective security concerns.""

CNN has geolocated and authenticated social media videos of these movements -- though there are likely many more that are not being observed. Some of the videos come from official sources; most are from TikTok or YouTube. They are being analyzed by online observers and often complement satellite imagery. Convoys near Belgorod Here's a convoy moving near Belgorod in western Russia, just across the border from the major Ukrainian city of Kharkiv: There's plenty of other evidence of the military build-up in the Belgorod region too. CNN geolocated these videos at the village of Sereteno, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the border. They were uploaded on Sunday and show tanks moving through the area. These videos can be geolocated to this spot: Night-time movements Russian forces are also moving at night in the area -- with tanks being offloaded from trains. There's more snow here than further south -- CNN geolocated this video to a village near Belgorod: Tanks around Voronezh The area around Voronezh also appears to be getting pretty crowded. A large collection of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles was filmed in the last couple of days from a passing train. According to analysts they are part of the Russian 1st Guards Tank Army. And seen from other angles: CNN has geolocated these clips to this spot: Helicopters near Belgorod In the last couple of days, more social media videos have featured the arrival of helicopters near the Ukrainian border. They could offer important protection for ground troops in the event of an offensive. These were filmed near Belgorod: The Russian build-up includes tanks, infantry fighting vehicles known as BMPs and self-propelled artillery -- as seen here on a train on the outskirts of Belgorod: A lot of the hardware is traveling south from the city of Kursk. CNN geolocated this video, which appears to have been filmed Saturday. Missiles and artillery support Michael Kofman, Russia analyst at CNA, a nonprofit organization based in Virginia, notes that units in Kursk (such as the 6th Combined Arms Army) ""appear to be moving up to Belgorod with district level artillery support. He says the 1st Guards Tank Army has started to move too -- ""presumably to a final staging area."" Of particular concern is the movement of convoys of Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles, which seems to have picked up in the last few weeks in various parts of western Russia. If a conflict began, these would likely be used to attack fixed Ukrainian positions -- such as command and control sites. They have a range of up to 250 miles (402 km) and have been spotted in recent satellite imagery. Rocket launchers near border Russian and Belarusian troops began sizeable joint exercises last week near the Polish border, but some Russian forces are on the move many miles from where the exercises are taking place and have taken up positions close to where the borders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus meet. CNN geolocated this convoy, which includes multiple rocket launchers, to a spot about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of the Ukrainian border. Russian weaponry -- and ships -- continue to close in on the Ukrainian border. Sites where equipment had been pre-positioned more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the border have been progressively emptied as units have moved forward. There are Russian units within a few miles of Ukraine all the way from the Sea of Azov, along the Ukrainian border and into Belarus. ""Russia's current military buildup near Ukraine is unprecedented,"" tweeted Rob Lee, from the Department of War Studies at King's College London. ""This is not like previous war scares or the buildup in the spring [of 2021]. The amount of Russian aerial, ground, and naval military power near Ukraine now is quantifiably far greater.""

2022-02-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-speech/index.html,Biden says US ready to give 'diplomacy every chance to succeed' in defusing Russia-Ukraine crisis,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday made an appeal for diplomacy to continue as the world watches to see if Russian President Vladimir Putin orders an invasion of neighboring Ukraine, but also warned that a Russian attack on Ukraine will ""be met with overwhelming international condemnation."" In a speech at the White House, Biden said to Russian citizens that the US and its allies are not a threat to them and that there's ""plenty"" of room for diplomacy with Russia to avoid a conflict in Europe. ""The United States and NATO are not a threat to Russia. Ukraine is not a threat to Russia. Neither the US nor NATO have missiles in Ukraine. We do not -- do not -- have plans to put them there, as well. We're not targeting the people of Russia. We do not seek to destabilize Russia. To the citizens of Russia: you are not our enemy,"" Biden said. The President told Russians he did not believe they wanted ""a bloody destructive war against Ukraine, a country and the people with whom you share such deep ties of family history and culture."" He harkened back to World War II, pointing out that Americans and Russians had ""fought and sacrificed side by side in the worst war in history."" ""World War II was a war of necessity, but if Russia attacks Ukraine, it would be a war of choice -- a war without cause or reason,"" he said, adding that he was not trying to ""provoke,"" but instead wanted to ""speak the truth."" ""If Russia does invade in the days and weeks ahead, the human costs for Ukraine will be immense, and the strategic cost for Russia will also be immense,"" the President warned. ""If Russia attacks Ukraine, to be met with overwhelming international condemnation."" ""The world will not forget that Russia chose needless death and destruction,"" he said. ""Invading Ukraine will prove to be a self-inflicted wound."" Biden sounded optimistic that diplomacy would resolve the crisis after Russia publicly proposed to continue talks, saying, ""We should give the diplomacy every chance to succeed and I believe there are real ways to address our respective security concerns."" The President said the US is ""proposing new arms control measures, new transparency measures (and) new strategic stability measures,"" adding that ""these measures apply to all parties -- NATO and Russia alike."" ""We're willing to make practical, result-oriented steps that can advance our common security,"" he continued. ""We will not sacrifice basic principles, though. Nations have a right to sovereignty and territorial integrity. They have the freedom to set their own course and choose with whom they will associate. But that still leaves plenty of room for diplomacy and for de-escalation. That's the best way forward for all parties in our view."" Despite his optimism about a path forward through diplomacy, Biden also cautioned that the US has not yet verified that Russia has begun the withdrawal of some troops following the completion of recent military drills. ""We have not yet verified the Russian military units are returning to their home bases. Indeed, our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position,"" Biden said. The President also underscored that ""Russia has more than 150,000 troops circling Ukraine and Belarus and along Ukraine's border, and invasion remains distinctly possible."" That amassing of troops has continued to raise fears among Western and Ukrainian intelligence officials that an invasion could be imminent. The Russian defense ministry said troops from its Southern and Western military districts -- parts of which are next door to Ukraine -- had begun to return to their home stations, though the announcement did not say precisely where those troops were permanently based, where they had been exercising, or how many of them were withdrawing. Russia announced earlier Tuesday that some of its troops would return to base after completing recent drills, but stressed that major military exercises would continue. Biden, on Tuesday, said that though the US is ""not seeking direct confrontation with Russia,"" he's been clear ""that if Russia targets Americans in Ukraine, we will respond forcefully."" ""If Russia attacks the United States or allies through asymmetric means, like disruptive cyberattacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we're prepared to respond,"" Biden said. He also addressed the consequences Americans will face if Russia moves into Ukraine, saying that ""the American people understand that defending democracy and liberty is never without cost."" The US is prepared to respond to higher energy prices and the potential for cyberattacks, he said. ""I will not pretend this will be painless,"" Biden noted. Biden held phone calls with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over the weekend. A senior Biden administration official called the Putin call ""professional and substantive,"" but said, ""There was no fundamental change in the dynamic that has been unfolding now for several weeks."" And a White House statement on Sunday's Ukraine call indicated that Biden said the US would respond ""swiftly and decisively"" if Russia takes further steps toward invasion. Last week and through the weekend, Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, publicly warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen in the coming days. ""We cannot perfectly predict the day, but we have now been saying for some time that we are in the window, and an invasion could begin, a major military action could begin by Russia in Ukraine any day now -- that includes this coming week, before the end of the Olympics,"" Sullivan told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday's ""State of the Union."" He added, ""The way they have built up their forces, the way they have maneuvered things in place, makes it a distinct possibility there will be major military action very soon. And we are prepared to continue to work on diplomacy, but we are also prepared to respond in a united and decisive way with our allies and partners should Russia proceed."" The US and other nations have warned their citizens in recent days to leave Ukraine. And on Monday, US announced it would be temporarily relocating its embassy in Kyiv to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine ""due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday accused Western countries and the press of spreading a ""large-scale disinformation campaign"" about an allegedly impending Russian invasion of Ukraine ""in order to divert attention from their own aggressive actions."" ""At the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, the global information space faced a media campaign unprecedented in its scale and sophistication, the purpose of which is to convince the world community that the Russian Federation is preparing an invasion of the territory of Ukraine,"" the Ministry said in a statement published on its website. CNN's Stephen Collinson writes the Ukraine crisis is largely a creation of Putin and his personal and disputed version of history, which that holds that the country, which was part of the Soviet Union until its breakup in 1991, should be part of greater Russia. There is also a deep resentment about how the Cold War ended with the admission of former Warsaw Pact nations, which were aligned with the Soviets -- like Poland, Romania and the Baltic states -- into NATO. While the alliance is defensive in nature, Putin sees its move into eastern Europe as a direct threat to Russia and his notion that Moscow is entitled to a sphere of influence in the region. Ukraine is not a NATO member so the US will not send troops to defend it. But Washington also says it should not be up to Putin to decide the destiny of another independent, sovereign democracy. In effect, Putin is holding Ukraine hostage with a demand for the withdrawal of NATO forces from eastern Europe that would amount to a major rewriting of the post-Cold War world that Washington will never accept. But he may perceive a historic moment in which he can open divisions in the alliance, forever crush Ukrainian dreams of joining the West, avenge the fall of the Soviet Union and advance his notion of Russian greatness. As tensions have escalated, Western allies have offered increasing forms of aid and assistance, including lethal aid. The US has shipped weapons supplies and ammunition to Ukraine and offered a sovereign loan guarantee to Ukraine of up to $1 billion to support its economic reform agenda and continued engagement with the International Monetary Fund.

2022-02-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/europe/russia-troops-bases-analysis-intl/index.html,Russia says it's moving some troops to their bases. What does this mean?,"On Wednesday, Belarus' foreign minister said ""not a single"" Russian soldier or piece of military equipment would remain in its territory after joint military drills conclude, while the Russian Ministry of Defense released video showing military equipment crossing the bridge from Crimea into Russia. This all comes a day after Russia announced that some troops would be returning to their home bases after completing exercises -- but President Joe Biden said the US had not yet verified any drawdown of the 150,000 Russian troops amassed near Ukraine's borders. How significant are the latest developments? Let's start with what we know. The statement given on Tuesday by Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, was very short on specifics. Troops of Russia's Southern and Western Military Districts, he said, had begun loading up their gear to return to their bases, but gave few specifics about where those units had been exercising, what their home stations are, or how many troops in total were heading home. What's more, we know from Ministry of Defense news releases that exercises in Belarus involve a significant number of troops from around the Russian Federation, including units based in Russia's Eastern Military District -- several time zones east of European Russia, a massive region bounded at its eastern edge by the Pacific Ocean. Russia is a massive country spanning 11 time zones; its military divides the country into five administrative territories: the Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Districts and the Northern Fleet. Troops leaving exercises in Crimea -- annexed by Russia in 2014 -- were technically exercising inside Russia's Southern Military District. Troops of the Southern Military District could potentially be returning to bases in the north Caucasus or Rostov oblast. Tuesday's statements, then, gives us very little official clue about how significant this move is: It could easily be a rotation -- with fresh troops falling in -- or a gradual drawdown after exercises. And Konashenkov made it clear that Russia's current exercises at sea have a fairly global sweep, taking place in ""operationally important areas of the world's oceans"" and in the waters adjacent to the territory of Russia. There are things to watch out for in the coming days. Putin and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko are set to meet this week, and we may get some hint on when the exercises in Belarus will conclude -- and when Russian soldiers there will go home. Asked about whether a decision on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarus would be made during that meeting, Kremlin spokesperson Peskov said: ""Let's not jump ahead. Let's wait for the meeting."" In the meantime, some Western officials were skeptical of the Russian troop announcement and said there had been no proof that a de-escalation of the crisis is on the cards. ""The signs coming from Moscow about willingness to continue to engage in diplomatic efforts ... gives some reason for cautious optimism. But we will, of course, follow very closely what's happening on the ground and whether this is reflected in some real de-escalation of the Russian military build-up in around Ukraine,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Tuesday.",4,3.8539472648599498,2.057668740095112,1.7962785247648378,16
2022-02-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/europe/ukraine-russia-news-tuesday-troop-pullback-intl/index.html,"Putin says some Russian troops are withdrawing after drills, but skepticism in Ukraine and US remains","President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Russia was sending some troops back to base after completing drills and that while he is open to further negotiations on the Ukraine crisis, Moscow's security demands were an ""unconditional priority."" Russia's claims about troop movements were met with skepticism from Western officials, who said they had seen no evidence that any partial withdrawal had begun. United States President Joe Biden told reporters Tuesday that the US has ""not yet verified the Russian military units are returning to their home bases,"" saying that they ""remain very much in a threatening position."" Speaking earlier at a news conference in Moscow alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Putin said he continued to view Western deterrence measures as a ""direct and immediate threat to national security."" ""The responses we received from the United States and NATO members to security guarantees proposals, in our opinion, do not meet the three basic Russian requirements,"" Putin said. ""We are ready to continue this joint work further. We are also ready to follow the negotiation track but all issues must be considered as a whole, without being separated from the main Russian proposals, the implementation of which is an unconditional priority for us."" Biden said Tuesday that Russia has amassed ""more than 150,000 troops circling Ukraine and Belarus, and along Ukraine's border,"" underscoring fears from Western and Ukrainian intelligence officials that an invasion could be imminent. Among the Kremlin's demands are a guarantee that Ukraine will never be permitted to join NATO and that the alliance roll back its expansion in Eastern Europe. The US and its NATO allies have repeatedly said such proposals are non-starters. Putin also invoked the word ""genocide"" Tuesday to describe the situation in territories in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatist militants, calling out the West for what he insinuated was a double standard for justifying military intervention. Claims of discrimination against Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine were one of the justifications Russia used when it annexed Crimea in 2014. Putin's comments came hours after the Russian defense ministry said some troops from its Southern and Western military districts had begun to return to their home stations. The announcement did not specify where those troops were permanently based, where they had been exercising, or how many of them were withdrawing, and it was viewed with skepticism by officials from Ukraine, the US and NATO, who called on Russia to provide proof it was willing to deescalate the crisis on the border. ""Various statements are constantly being made from the Russian Federation, so we already have a rule: 'Do not hear and then believe. But do see and then believe,'"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a news conference in Kyiv. ""When we see the withdrawal, then we will believe in de-escalation."" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had not yet seen ""any sign of deescalation on the ground,"" but added that ""signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue"" were grounds for cautious optimism. Personnel from Russia's Southern military district began returning to base from Crimea -- the territory annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 -- following the conclusion of exercises, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported Tuesday, citing Southern military district spokesperson Col. Vadim Astafyev. ""The personnel of the battalion tactical groups made marches to the areas of railway stations, where the loading of military equipment on the echelons is organized. Heavy tracked armored vehicles -- tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery -- are fixed on the platforms of the wagons, Astafyev said. Earlier Tuesday, Major General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian defense ministry, announced the troop movements but also added that large-scale drills would continue. ""In the armed forces of the Russian Federation, a complex of large-scale operational training measures by the forces continues, with almost all military districts, fleets and airborne troops taking part in them,"" he said. ""As part of the test of the reaction forces of the Union State, a joint Russian-Belarusian exercise 'Allied Resolve-2022' is being held on the territory of the Republic of Belarus."" Konashenkov also said a series of naval drills -- involving surface ships, submarines and naval aviation -- was underway both in ""operationally important areas of the world's oceans"" and in the waters adjacent to the territory of Russia. ""Exercises are continuing with formations and military units at other training grounds on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" he added. Meanwhile on Tuesday, a cyberattack hit the websites of Ukraine's defense ministry and armed forces, and the websites of two Ukrainian banks. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the hacking incident. 'Still time to step back from the brink' The Kremlin's troop announcement came a day after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said there was still room for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. In a carefully choreographed meeting that was shown on Russian television on Monday, Putin asked Lavrov: is there a ""chance to reach an agreement with our partners on key issues that are of concern to us, or is it just an attempt to drag us into an endless negotiation process that has no logical resolution?"" Seated at the opposite end of a very long table, Lavrov responded: ""If we are ready to listen to some counter-proposals, it seems to me that our possibilities are far from being exhausted."" NATO's Stoltenberg on Tuesday expressed hope that a war could be avoided, but said the alliance would not compromise on its core principles. ""Everything is now in place for a new attack, but Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday. The flurry of high-profile diplomacy continued Tuesday with Scholz becoming the latest leader to travel to Moscow for talks. Scholz, who was meeting Putin for the first time as the German Chancellor, said it was the leaders' ""damned duty to prevent a war in Europe."" ""For us Germans, but also for all Europeans, it is important that sustainable security cannot be achieved against Russia, but only with Russia,"" Scholz said. However, while Scholz was urging de-escalation, he didn't shy away from criticizing Russia, specifically mentioning the jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who is currently facing another trial. ""As far as Mr. Navalny is concerned, my position is very clear, this is not compatible with the principles of the rule of law."" Meanwhile, US ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said Tuesday the US was ""monitoring the situation"" after the Kremlin's troop announcement, but added that the US ""will have to verify"" any claims of a potential move towards deescalation by Russia. ""We have noticed today that Russia is claiming that they are moving towards some sort of de-escalation. We are monitoring the situation,"" Smith said. ""We will have to verify whether or not that is in fact the case. Speaking during a press briefing in Brussels, the US ambassador further noted that Russia ""made a similar claim"" regarding a potential de-escalation of tensions in December, but this later proved false. But while the Kremlin was talking about troops returning home, satellite images released by Maxar Technologies revealed fresh signs of a Russian buildup. An analysis of the images showed that at least 60 helicopters had landed within the past few days at a previously vacant airbase in Russian-occupied Crimea. The helicopters are a mixture of transport and attack aircraft. Archival satellite imagery reviewed by CNN indicates the base at Donuzlav Lake on the northwest coast of Crimea has been vacant since at least 2003. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he was not encouraged by the latest intelligence on Russia's buildup around Ukraine and said western leaders were receiving ""mixed signals"" from Moscow. ""We've got Russian field hospitals being constructed near the border with Ukraine, in Belarus for [what] only can be construed as a preparation for an invasion,"" Johnson said. ""You've got more battalion tactical groups actually being brought closer to the border with Ukraine, according to the intelligence that we're seeing."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave a noncommittal response Tuesday when asked about a move by Russian lawmakers to appeal to President Putin to recognize two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent. Donetsk and Luhank have been controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Asked in a conference call with reporters about the legislative action, Peskov said: ""No one remains indifferent to the fate of Donbas. But still, Russia has repeatedly declared that it remains committed to the Minsk package of measures, and that Russia is in favor of the implementation of the entire Minsk plan as soon as possible, in the sequence that exists."" Donbas refers to the territories in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russia-backed separatist militants. Asked about the issue during the news conference with Scholz, Putin said there were ""mass and systematic violations of human rights in Ukraine and outright discrimination of Russian speaking citizens on legislative level."" Putin responded abruptly when Scholz expressed hope for a peaceful resolution in Ukraine, after recalling NATO's military intervention in response to the danger of genocide in the former Yugoslavia. ""According to our estimates, what is happening in the Donbas today is genocide,"" Putin responded. Putin has spoken repeatedly about what he describes as the violation of the rights of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine and elsewhere, and has stated that it is within Russia's rights to intervene militarily to protect them. It was not the first time he's used the word ""genocide"" to describe what he calls Russophobia or discrimination against Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. It's a term -- much like the word ""fascist"" -- that can be thrown around loosely in Russian political speech and does not necessarily imply direct comparison to internationally defined and recognized cases of genocide.",4,2.0929632129252655,3.8296327724904673,-1.7366695595652017,17
2022-02-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/politics/russia-ukraine-politics-us-putin-diplomacy/index.html,A world on edge awaits Putin's critical move,"The world is suspended in an extraordinary moment of geopolitical limbo, on edge for a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine amid conflicting signals in Moscow, confusion in Kyiv and dire warnings from Washington. Already extreme tensions rose even further as one of the most dangerous moments in Europe since World War II stretches nerves and leaves everyone -- apart perhaps from President Vladimir Putin -- wondering what is next. On Monday, there were signs of a possible last-minute openness to a diplomatic off-ramp in the Kremlin, but the spectacle of an estimated 130,000 troops on high alert outside Ukraine's borders suggested a feint as much as a blink by Putin. And Russia announced Tuesday that some of its troops would return to their bases after completing recent drills, but stressed that major military exercises would continue. It was not immediately clear how many troops were involved, following weeks of military buildups. Still, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said signs from Moscow showed that ""diplomacy should continue."" He added: ""This gives grounds for cautious optimism. But so far, we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground."" Tuesday's developments saw confusion reigning -- not for the first time -- in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, as President Volodymyr Zelensky, a young leader facing the highest stakes, sarcastically dismissed Western projections of a possible Russian invasion on February 16. And in contrast with the foreboding signs elsewhere, couples flocked to Kyiv's bars and restaurants to celebrate Valentine's Day despite the looming threat of war. In Washington, the mood music grew even darker. While believing that Putin hasn't finally made up his mind, multiple officials suggested Russia could move against Ukraine at any moment. And one source familiar with the matter predicted an invasion was more likely this week than not -- and said Moscow could maintain its current force posture for quite some time even if it doesn't cross the border. There is a palpable sense that Russia and the West have reached a historic fork in the road. Down one route lies a return to the confrontation and tensions that prevailed for decades during the Cold War. Down the other might lie a diplomatic fudge that no key player seems able to frame given stark Russian demands. A crisis America doesn't need At a moment when many Americans are facing rising prices for basic goods and gasoline and are exhausted by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ukraine crisis seems distant and esoteric. But a Russian invasion could force up energy prices even more and rock stock markets, on which many rely for their retirements. The crisis is largely a creation of Putin and his personal and disputed version of history that holds that Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union until its breakup in 1991, should be part of greater Russia. It also stems from his deep resentment about how the Cold War ended and the admission of former Warsaw Pact nations, which had been aligned with Soviets, into NATO. In effect, Putin is holding Ukraine hostage with a demand for the withdrawal of those NATO forces from Eastern Europe -- a concession that would contradict 70 years of the West's doctrine that independent nations choose their own destinies. If America's long support for democracy and free-market capitalism is to mean anything in a new era when its power and example are being challenged by autocracies like China, it has no alternative but to stand up for Ukraine. Waiting on Putin In essence, the world was left wondering and worrying Monday what one man -- Putin -- will do next. There are plenty of reasons why the Russian leader may step back at the brink. An invasion might swiftly overcome Ukraine's forces. But the country is bigger than Germany or France and an insurgency -- perhaps supported by US weapons and funds -- could be a disaster for Russia. The sight of Russian troops being killed could further hurt Putin's declining popularity. But a burst of nationalism triggered by war abroad could boost his standing in a nation he rules with an iron fist. And Putin is not shy about wielding military might for political advantage, for instance against separatists in the Russian republic of Chechnya and in his annexation of Crimea -- in Ukraine -- in 2014. But some analysts believe that he has already achieved many of his objectives -- effectively setting back any aspirations Ukraine may have of joining NATO in the future. He has inserted Russia, disdained by many leaders as a declining power, back into the spotlight and is welcoming a parade of foreign leaders and ministers to Moscow. On Tuesday, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will visit the vastly more experienced Putin in a test of his resolve stiffened by a White House visit last week. The continuing diplomatic dance is a reason for hope that war could be avoided. But the fact that Putin has built such a massive force around Ukraine, in Russia, Belarus and in the Black Sea means that a decision not to invade may be seen as a loss of face. The former KGB officer, who was in East Germany when the Berlin Wall fell, also feels the humiliation of the Soviet collapse deeply. He seems to believe that NATO, a defensive alliance, is an offensive threat to Russia, one that may require him to build a buffer around Russian territory by invading Ukraine -- which has borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania -- all NATO members once behind the Iron Curtain. The US will not send troops to Ukraine, because it's not a NATO member. But if Putin invades, troops from the US and Russia, the world's two top nuclear powers, could soon be in close proximity in Europe, with the alarming possibility of miscalculations. Hope for diplomacy? A day that saw glimmers of hope and ended with even more chilling warnings from the United States started in Moscow, where Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had what appeared to be a scripted on-camera event. ""I must say that there is always a chance,"" Lavrov said, referring to the prospects for diplomacy. Putin had earlier asked Lavrov whether efforts to talk Russia down were ""just an attempt to drag us into an endless negotiation process that has no logical resolution."" His comment was ironic since many in the West believe this is exactly Putin's game and that talks are just a bluff until the moment is right to move on Ukraine. Still, the appearance could indicate Putin is finally seeking a diplomatic off-ramp, though NATO would never accept his demands to leave Eastern Europe. ""Signals today suggest that they may be looking at some last-minute diplomatic maneuvers,"" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN's Becky Anderson in an interview. ""I do think as Putin gets closer to pulling the trigger here, he is better understanding the costs."" Washington and its allies have threatened the most crippling sanctions ever on Russia's economy if Putin invades. Michael Bociurkiw, the former spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, also expressed tempered hope. ""It's hard to know what to believe coming out of Mr. Lavrov's mouth,"" Bociurkiw said on ""CNN Newsroom"" but added that the airing of his encounter with Putin on Russian state TV was significant. ""To me, it indicated that they're willing to hold off on a possible military solution to their Ukraine issue. There are more foreign ministers coming later in the week. ... So that was their way of saying, 'We're open to more dialogue.' "" Dark warnings from Washington Still, if US sources are to be believed, the photo op in Moscow was all for show. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Putin ""continues to add to"" his ""menu of options"" with new land, sea and air forces. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the US had closed its Kyiv embassy ""due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces."" A source familiar with the matter told CNN's Natasha Bertrand that a Russian attack on Ukraine is more likely this week than not, and if it doesn't happen on that timetable it doesn't mean that the threat has passed. Senators emerging from a briefing with national security adviser Jake Sullivan were equally pessimistic. ""This is a very dangerous situation,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters. The committee's chair, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, added: ""The forces the Russians have massed, they could launch at any point. Nothing I heard today dissuaded me from that."" Grim US rhetoric continued a trend of remarkably frank US and Western commentary on the situation based on declassified information, apparently designed both to increase pressure on Putin and to smoke out any attempt by Moscow to fake an incident as a ruse to justify an invasion. But all along, there has been a gap between Washington and Kyiv on the possibility of an invasion. Zelensky sent shock waves all the way to the US on Monday when he named February 16 a day of national unity, while referencing foreign fears of an invasion. But when CNN asked Mykhailo Podoliak, a presidential adviser, how to take his comments, he replied: ""Of course, with irony."" It seems an odd time for sarcasm. But Zelensky is a former comic actor and might feel justified in dark humor given the circumstances.

2022-02-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/politics/us-russia-ukraine-misinformation/index.html,US accuses Moscow spies of working with Russian-language media outlets to spread Ukraine disinformation,"The US believes Russian intelligence agencies have worked closely with the editorial staff of five Russian-language media outlets to boost public support for a renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine, US officials familiar with the intelligence assessment told CNN in a media briefing. Officers with Russia's domestic and foreign intelligence agencies, the FSB and SVR, have covertly planted articles in publications that blame the West for tensions with Russia over Ukraine, question the legitimacy of the Ukrainian government and challenge the US commitment to its European allies, US officials alleged. A pillar of the alleged propaganda scheme is the Strategic Culture Foundation, a Russian journal that the US Treasury Department sanctioned last April for spreading disinformation in the 2020 US election, officials said. The US officials did not present the underlying intelligence the allegations were based on, and they declined to describe how the information was obtained. Some of the information is corroborated by open-source reporting. The disclosure is part of a furious effort by the Biden administration to declassify intelligence in the hope of preempting Russian military action in Ukraine, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other US officials have said could happen at any time. Russia has massed an estimated 130,000 troops on Ukraine's border, according to two sources familiar with recent assessments. The disinformation campaign ""is a primary vector for how the Russian government will bolster support domestically for an invasion into Ukraine, as well as spread any disinformation on a false flag operation,"" a US official authorized to speak on background with the media told CNN. Neither the Strategic Culture Foundation nor the Russian Embassy in Washington responded to a request for comment. Russia has previously denied US allegations that the Kremlin was spreading misinformation. The declassified US assessment reflects the views of agencies across the government and of US allies, officials said, and it illuminates how US spy agencies view the intermingling of Russian publishers and intelligence operatives. US officials allege that Vladimir Maximenko, the head of the Strategic Culture Foundation, has met in person with his SVR handlers and that publications controlled by Maximenko -- known as Fondsk and Odna Rodyna -- have been spreading disinformation on Ukraine. Neither Fondsk nor Odna Rodyna responded to a request for comment. Russia's FSB intelligence agency, meanwhile, pulls the strings on media outlets known as News Front, Antifaschst and Politnavigator, according to US intelligence. The coordination is so close that known FSB officers tell the journals when to publish articles and when to delete certain content, according to US officials. The US Treasury sanctioned Crimea-based News Front last year for spreading disinformation. In addition to Russian, the outlet publishes in English, Polish and other languages in an effort to reach a wide audience. News Front is led by Konstantin Knyrik, who has been active for years in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. US officials allege that senior FSB officers have praised Knyrik for spreading misinformation in Ukraine. News Front did not respond to a request for comment on the US allegations against Knyrik. Biden administration officials have aggressively sought to out alleged Russian machinations in Ukraine in recent weeks, including by speaking publicly about alleged Russian plans to make a video, replete with actors and corpses, depicting a fake attack on Russia as a pretext for invading Ukraine. ""The costs of inaction at this moment likely offset any risk"" for the US intelligence community in disclosing intelligence on Russian activities in Ukraine, said Gavin Wilde, a former National Security Council official focused on Russia. ""The Biden administration is creating all the friction it can, and I think that's a positive development that I hope carries forward,"" Wilde, who is now a managing consultant at Krebs Stamos Group, told CNN.",20,4.401470494420783,4.31098259013936,0.0904879042814235,19
2022-02-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/world/ukraine-cyberattack-intl/index.html,Cyberattack hits websites of Ukraine defense ministry and armed forces,"A cyberattack hit the websites of Ukraine's defense ministry and armed forces, and the websites of two Ukrainian banks on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian government agencies' statements. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the hacking incident. ""It's too early to attribute"" responsibility, Victor Zhora, a deputy chairman at the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP) -- who is investigating the incident -- told CNN. The incident comes as Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops close to Ukraine's border, according to United States President Joe Biden, and as US officials warn that a fresh Russian invasion could come at any time. Russia has denied it is planning to invade Ukraine. SSSCIP identified the incident as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which floods a website with phony traffic to disrupt access to it. DDoS attacks are relatively cheap and easy to carry out. While they can be disruptive, they do not necessarily require sophistication. Ukrainian officials said that by 7:30 p.m. local time (12:30 p.m. ET) access to the websites of the banks -- PrivatBank and Oschadbank -- had been restored. CNN journalists in Ukraine reported difficulty accessing the websites of the defense agencies Tuesday night. Ukrainian government officials ""continue to monitor and cut off"" the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from which the hackers are flooding Ukrainian websites with traffic, Zhora said. DDoS attacks can be difficult to trace to their source as hackers can spoof their locations to make it seem they are in a country they are not. Matt Tait, a cybersecurity expert and former information security specialist with the UK government's signals intelligence agency, said the DDoS attack appears to ""be part of a general campaign of harassment and demoralization against the public encouraged by the Russian government."" ""That said, this is quite distinct from military/kinetic cyberattacks that might be used in direct conflict, such as to disable utilities or achieve direct military objectives,"" Tait told CNN. ""For this reason, I would urge caution in seeing this event as a direct precursor to invasion."" Russia routinely denies conducting cyberattacks. A separate cyberattack hit Ukrainian government websites last month. Ukrainian officials suggested Russian and Belarusian involvement, but investigators have not formally blamed those countries for the cyberattack.",20,6.4395336094947115,4.975187414210698,1.4643461952840138,2
2022-02-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/politics/us-embassy-kyiv-closure/index.html,US closing embassy in Kyiv and moving remaining diplomats to western Ukraine amid fears of Russian invasion,"The United States is closing the US Embassy in Kyiv and ""temporarily relocating"" the small number of remaining diplomatic personnel in the country to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, ""due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Monday. ""I have ordered these measures for one reason -- the safety of our staff -- and we strongly urge any remaining US citizens in Ukraine to leave the country immediately,"" Blinken said in a statement. The moves comes days after the US ordered the vast majority of US government employees to leave the country and announced that consular services at the US Embassy would be suspended as of Sunday amid fears of an imminent Russian invasion, even as US officials stressed they remain committed to trying to find a diplomatic outcome. Although Moscow has said it is open to negotiation, State Department spokesperson Ned Price noted Monday that ""it remains unclear to us whether Russia is interested in pursuing a diplomatic path as opposed to the use of force."" A source familiar with the matter told CNN that a Russian attack on Ukraine sometime this week is more likely than not. But if Russia does not make a move this week, the source noted, it does not necessarily mean it won't happen -- Russia can maintain its current force posture for quite some time. Price said the decision to move all remaining diplomats from Kyiv to western Ukraine was made because the State Department felt it was ""absolutely necessary"" due to the ""distinct possibility, perhaps more real than ever before, that Russia may decide to proceed with military action."" ""We are basing our assessment on what we are seeing on the ground with our own eyes, which is a continued and unprovoked Russian buildup on the border of Ukraine and no accompanying evidence of de-escalation,"" he said at a briefing at the State Department, noting that Lviv's location ""affords it a degree of protection that other places in Ukraine may not have."" Price said there had been ""great deal of meticulous planning that went into"" relocating the embassy ""and as a testament to that, for example, we did not have to destroy any valid passports."" ""We have undertaken prudent precautions when it comes to sensitive documents, sensitive equipment, but just can't offer a whole lot of detail there,"" he said. A senior State Department official said Saturday that US diplomats had gotten rid of classified information in recent days in preparation of the embassy draw down. Price noted that if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to invade Ukraine, ""There would be widespread human suffering."" US officials have repeatedly called on American citizens to leave Ukraine immediately, warning that a Russian invasion come at any moment, including as soon as this week. ""What we are trying to do publicly is be transparent to American citizens that they should leave Ukraine immediately, because there will not be a military evacuation in the event of an invasion,"" National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. 'Intention to return' Price said the Ukrainian National Guard Police will guard the US Embassy in Kyiv, adding, ""It is certainly our intention to return to that embassy in Kyiv just as soon as it is safe for us to do so."" The staff relocated to Lviv include the ""core"" diplomatic team, including charge d'affaires Kristina Kvien and they ""will remain engaged with Ukrainian government coordinating on diplomatic efforts,"" Price said. The source familiar told CNN that they believe the gap between the US and Ukraine when it comes to the likelihood of a Russian attack is narrowing -- Ukraine has been skeptical that such an invasion is imminent, but in private conversations they have been more focused on expressing concerns about how the US' warnings about an invasion have impacted them domestically, politically and economically. Blinken spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Monday -- their second conversation in a matter of days -- and stressed the US and allies' ""commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including its economic and financial stability."" The two discussed macro-financial support, according to Kyiv, and the Biden administration is considering offering up to $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine amid concerns over a potential Russian invasion, multiple sources familiar with the matter said. The US has also had conversations with Moscow in recent days. Blinken spoke with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ahead of President Joe Biden's call with Putin. ""On our call, Foreign Minister Lavrov said that Russians are working on a response to the paper that we sent to Moscow more than two weeks ago, proposing concrete areas for discussion,"" Blinken said Saturday, adding that ""it remains to be seen if they'll follow through on that, but if they do we'll be ready to engage together with our allies and partners."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov late Monday told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen that Putin is ""willing to negotiate,"" saying the Ukraine crisis was only one part of Russia's larger security concerns. Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Putin he saw a ""chance"" for diplomatic dialogue with the West over Russia's security concerns, saying he recommended such efforts continue. As of Monday, the US had yet to receive that response from Moscow, Price said, ""and in order for this to bear fruit, it will also have to take place in the context of de-escalation, and that is just not something we've seen to date.""

2022-02-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/europe/ukraine-russia-disinformation-us-uk-intelligence-cmd-gbr-intl/index.html,"The West is a player in the Ukraine information war. Unlike Russia, it has to convince the public","Corpses strewn through wrecked buildings in the aftermath of an apparently deadly explosion. Distraught mourners, grieving for lost loved ones. And amid the smoldering ruins, evidence of Western military equipment. In a world all too familiar with graphic images of one disaster after another, it's easy to imagine the grim footage. And the United States says that's exactly what this is: make-believe violence. It says Russia is plotting to stage a fake attack, and shoot a gory propaganda video of it, as a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. The clip would frame the Ukrainian military -- and by extension, their NATO allies -- for an attack on Russian-speaking people. But while the US government declassified the information about the alleged plot last week, it didn't share any of its underlying evidence with the public. In a heated briefing room exchange last week, journalists demanded proof to support the claim, with one reporter accusing the State Department of veering into ""Alex Jones territory."" State Department spokesperson Ned Price responded that the government was confident in the information but would not say if the US had seen any such video. ""We are trying to deter the Russians from moving forward with this type of activity. That is why we are making it public,"" Price said, before adding: ""If you doubt the credibility of the US government, of the British government, of other governments, and want to find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do. "" The US claim came days after the British government warned of a Russian plot to install a pro-Kremlin leader in Ukraine, citing intelligence that it also declined to release publicly. Analysts said the developments showed the West was becoming more determined to take on Russia in the information war, a sphere in which the Kremlin has often had the upper hand in recent years. But that is not without its risks. It is one thing to try to deter potential disinformation campaigns, which are designed to give plausible deniability to leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin. But it becomes another when a liberal democracy relies on unpublished intelligence to convince an already skeptical public of a looming threat. News of the alleged false flag attack comes at a time of historically low levels of public trust in the US and British governments. As a result, there is more pressure for officials to lift the veil on their intelligence. ""During the Cold War, most people knew about the Soviet threat, and we did not need to provide evidence to show that was an issue,"" said Dan Lomas, an intelligence and security studies lecturer at London's Brunel University, explaining that in a ""bipolar world the threat was pretty real to more people."" Western intelligence agencies during the Cold War would ""collect, analyze information, and then provide that to governments who will then use that to shape policy responses,"" he said. That process is less straightforward in our current multipolar world. ""Now we are getting into a world of multiple threats, the water has been muddied, and often evidence needs to be cited to justify policy actions taken"" by liberal democracies, Lomas said. Despite last Thursday's heated briefing room exchange, four disinformation analysts CNN spoke to were adamant that declassifying intelligence of this sort was unprecedented for the US. They said it also showed that democracies were finally taking pre-emptive action against the Kremlin's disinformation playbook -- which primed Russians for the 2014 invasion of Crimea and caught out NATO and its allies. Russian Ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov told CNN last week that Moscow was not planning any false flag operations as a pretext to invade Ukraine. But Russia is no stranger to such tactics. ""In 2014, an actress claimed that a little boy had been crucified in the Donbas, and that was completely false,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert and fellow at the Wilson Center, a non-partisan think tank. ""It was debunked, but this story ran on Russian media and, to my knowledge, they still run with that story."" Jankowicz told CNN that Russia had ""handily misattributed footage from the Balkan wars that they claimed to be from South Ossetia and Abkhazia"" during its five-day war with Georgia in 2008. She said ""prebuttals"" to Russian disinformation were a vital deterrent in an information war in which the West has largely been on the back foot. Patchy record But there are credible reasons for not revealing intelligence: doing so risks unmasking sources and divulging the methodologies employed to gather it. Lomas said that in 1927 the British government read out diplomatic signals intelligence in Parliament to justify a raid on a Soviet trade delegation in London. ""The Russians then knew that their communications were being read by the British government,"" he explained. As a result, Russia changed its messaging system, impacting Britain's ability to intercept Russian communications for years. Yet journalists are understandably wary of reporting messages they are unable to verify independently -- especially when the official narrative hasn't always proved accurate. Last August, when a Hellfire missile fired by a US drone struck a car in a Kabul compound, the Pentagon insisted that the dead were terrorists. An investigation later revealed that all those killed were civilians, among them seven children. Past intelligence failures, like the ""weapons of mass destruction"" given as the rationale for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, continue to haunt public opinion of American and British interventions. In 2013, the British government lost a parliamentary vote on joining US-led airstrikes in Syria despite intelligence linking Syrian government forces to a chemical weapons attack in Damascus. Polling at the time showed the majority of the British public opposed airstrikes. Ahead of the vote, then-Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""One thing is indisputable: The well of public opinion was well and truly poisoned by the Iraq episode, and we need to understand the public skepticism."" Nevertheless, there are ways to fix the credibility problem. Lomas suggests finding a better messenger. When the British government alleged in January that Russia was looking to install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv, the revelation came just as Prime Minister Boris Johnson was embroiled in a political crisis over alleged parties in Downing Street while the UK was under Covid-19 restrictions. This meant that Britain's release of sensitive intelligence was greeted with skepticism by some commentators, who wondered whether the hawkish tone was part of a strategy designed to help keep Johnson in power. Lomas said the news might have landed better if it had been announced by Britain's intelligence agencies, since ""polling consistently tells us that intelligence agencies and ... civil servants are trusted far more than politicians in delivering key messages."" Information wars The debate over how to handle intelligence-based claims presented without evidence shows just how uneven the playing field is when dealing with autocracies such as Russia -- which has long used the information space as an active front in its conflicts. Most recently, Russia accused the search and rescue volunteer organization, the ""White Helmets"" group, in 2018 of chemical attacks linked to the Syrian regime -- a Moscow ally. The group, celebrated internationally for their live-saving work in Syria, was a frequent target of pro-Kremlin disinformation sites, which sought to delegitimize their work by claiming they were terrorists or stooges of Western intelligence. ""All we have on our side is the truth,"" said Jankowicz. ""Russia is willing to create troll accounts and other false amplifiers, and play with the facts, and manipulate images."" ""It is not fighting fire with fire in that regard,"" she explained. ""We're always going to be a little bit less equipped to deal with this stuff."" Since 2014, when pro-Russian rebels began seizing territory in eastern Ukraine, there has been a constant stream of disinformation about Ukraine. None of the analysts CNN spoke to have seen evidence of the alleged Russian false flag operation revealed by the US last week -- but none of them doubt the intelligence. ""What's interesting is, starting in December, the Russians were the ones promoting the idea that this war would be started by a Ukrainian false flag,"" Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy, told CNN. Schafer points to a statement made last December by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu who claimed that US mercenaries were helping Ukrainian special forces ""for active hostilities"" in eastern Ukraine. According to a transcript shared on the government's website, Shoigu alleged that supplies of an ""unidentified chemical component"" had been delivered to the region ""to carry out provocations."" The US has denied the claim. Shafer said Russian media sites ran with the claim, echoing a narrative already being pumped out on pro-Russian websites. ""What is interesting is the Russians were the ones promoting the idea that the war would be started by a Ukrainian/US-NATO false flag,"" he said. ""It has been a sort of a back and forth of the two sides accusing the other of a false flag [operation]."" In recent years, the crackdown by social media companies on Russian bots has led to higher profile voices, such as news sites and personalities like Shoigu, playing a major role in the Kremlin's drumbeat. Analysis from Schafer's team found that since November last year, Russian propagandists and news sites have claimed that: Ukraine is a failed state; Ukrainian politicians are neo-Nazis; US and NATO are to blame for the increasing likelihood of war and that -- despite amassing more than 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine's borders -- Russia is not the aggressor. The UK-based Centre for Information Resilience, where Jankowicz is a senior adviser, has seen a 200% increase in posts claiming Ukraine is the aggressor against Russia compared to this time in 2021. Online narratives around Ukrainian neo-Nazis and NATO aggression have also seen a ""huge spike in the past week,"" she said. And American media personalities have helped launder some of these talking points. In December, Fox News host Tucker Carlson reported that a ""NATO takeover of Ukraine would compromise Russia's access to its Sevastopol Naval Base."" Jankowicz said the US is badly disadvantaged ""because the issue of Russian disinformation [became] so polarized"" in the Trump era, she said. ""People hear the word Russia, and there's a huge dose of distrust that comes along with that for certain parts of the political spectrum on ... the far left and the far right.""

The Russian Foreign Ministry statement comes just hours ahead of an expected call between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, and as the US issued a stark warning that a Russian assault on Ukraine was imminent. ""At the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, the global information space faced a media campaign unprecedented in its scale and sophistication, the purpose of which is to convince the world community that the Russian Federation is preparing an invasion of the territory of Ukraine,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement late Friday. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned Friday that a Russian assault on Ukraine could begin soon, including with bombs and missiles. Sullivan advised all Americans to depart the country as quickly as possible for their own safety, echoing the call of a growing number of embassies that are doing the same. While Sullivan said it is not clear whether Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, he said there was a ""very distinct possibility"" that Russia would act militarily. The Kremlin has long denied it is planning to attack and has argued that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. Earlier Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US continues ""to see very troubling signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border."" The US estimates Russia has more than 100,000 troops near the Ukraine border, with thousands added just this week, according to an administration official. On Thursday, new satellite images released by the US-based technology company Maxar appeared to show the continuing Russian military buildup in Crimea, western Russia and Belarus. The images were released on the same day Russia and Belarus began 10 days of joint military drills, underscoring Ukrainian intelligence officials' fear that Russia could use Belarus as a ""full-fledged theater of operations."" Russia ramped up its military presence in Belarus from several thousand troops in January to an estimated 30,000 sometime this month. Meanwhile, in the Ukrainian capital Friday, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko outlined steps to safeguard ""critical and social infrastructure facilities"" in ""the event of a possible emergency."" In a statement issued on Telegram, Klitschko said, ""Our efforts are aimed at preventing or overcoming both possible provocations and withstanding a military attack."" He said those efforts included generating additional electricity production and creating fuel reserves for ""a period of up to 10 days,"" adding there are more than 500 storage facilities and nearly 4,500 ""dual-use structures"" available as civil protection services across the city. Klitschko also said evacuation plans had been set up at the district level across the capital. Blinken reaffirmed ""the United States' robust support for Ukraine in the face of an increasingly acute threat of possible further Russian aggression"" in a call with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Saturday morning local time in Australia. Blinken ""underscored that any and all aggression against Ukraine by Russia will be met with swift, severe and united consequences,"" spokesperson Ned Price said.",4,2.4941156901133925,3.1407087663231827,-0.6465930762097902,20
2022-02-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/politics/us-security-intelligence-prep-russian-hacking-threats/index.html,US security and intelligence agencies prep for potential Russian hacking threats,"Intelligence and national security agencies across the US government met on Friday to discuss how the Biden administration might respond to cyberattacks from Russia in light of the Ukraine crisis, three US officials familiar with the meeting told CNN. The meeting -- which convened officials from the White House, intelligence agencies, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies via videoconference -- underscores how the Biden administration sees cyberspace as a key front in the tensions over Russia's threat to again invade Ukraine. The focus of the meeting was how US agencies can work with companies across critical sectors of the economy to respond to potential hacking incidents, whether from criminal operations or state actors, the three officials said. One issue raised was the possibility of an uptick in ransomware attacks on US companies by Russian-speaking criminal gangs, two of the officials said. Another point of discussion was how the US can provide cybersecurity assistance for Ukraine, whose government faced a string of cyberattacks in mid-January, two of the US officials said. There's a ""specific, credible threat"" to Ukrainian infrastructure right now, but not to US infrastructure, one official told CNN. The goal is to be ready if that changes, and for federal officials to be able to respond with affected companies should any big hacks take place. The interagency meeting comes as US officials have urged companies to be on high alert for hacking threats from Russia, with the FBI surveying companies for signs of compromise. Officials from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security briefed state and local government officials Monday on potential Russian hacking threats, asking attendees to lower their thresholds for reporting unusual cyber activity, two people familiar with the call told CNN. Yahoo News first reported on the Monday briefing. Ransomware attacks from Russian-speaking hackers have hobbled US critical infrastructure companies in the past year, including an incident last year that forced major US fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline to shut down for days. Russia has historically been reluctant to crack down on cybercriminals operating from its soil -- so long as the hackers leave Russian organizations alone. But in recent weeks -- as Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border -- Russian authorities have also taken the rare step of arresting high-profile cybercriminals. White House officials believe Russia's domestic intelligence agency in January arrested the person responsible for the cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline attack. A senior administration official previously denied any connection between tensions over Ukraine and the FSB arrests. But Dmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert who is chairman of the non-profit Silverado Policy Accelerator, sees the Russian move as ""ransomware diplomacy."" It was a signal, he previously told CNN, from the Kremlin that if the US retaliates with harsh sanctions over Russian aggression in Ukraine, any semblance of US-Russia cooperation on cybercrime could disappear. A National Security Council spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""While there are not currently any specific credible threats to the U.S. homeland, we are mindful of the potential for Russia to consider escalating its destabilizing actions in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine,"" a senior administration official previously told CNN.

In Moscow, you might not know it","Read most headlines coming out of the West around Ukraine, and the situation looks dire. Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""could begin at any time""-- US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. ""American citizens should leave now"" -- President Joe Biden. ""The number of (Russian) troops is going up, while the warning time is going down"" -- NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. In Kyiv, many embassies are advising their citizens to pack their bags and leave as fresh shipments of military aid -- including pallets of US-made Javelin anti-tank missiles -- arrive on the tarmac in Ukraine. But in Moscow, it's still possible to get a late booking at the swish Café Pushkin, although it's a bit harder to get a table at another prime people-watching venue, Dr. Zhivago, a stone's throw from Red Square. That's not to suggest the Ukraine crisis is not front and center in Russia. A flurry of high-level diplomatic visits has dominated the airwaves this week, beginning with French President Emmanuel Macron's one-on-one meeting with Russian President Putin and concluding with a sit-down between Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu and UK Secretary of State for Defense Ben Wallace. But in the glittering disco-ball that is Russia's capital city, the geopolitical drama feels like an illusion. Despite the talk of an imminent Russian attack -- and the indisputable evidence that Russia has ringed the Ukrainian border with more than 100,000 combat ready troops and sent new warships into the Black Sea -- Russia hardly seems to be on a war footing, at least as far as the public discussion goes. Take for instance, Russian state media's coverage of UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday. The tone was jovial, and sometimes outright trolling. Russian observers focused on Truss' sartorial choices (with state television channel Russia 24 noting her fur hat à la Russe) and her unfortunate gaffe over the location of Rostov and Voronezh oblasts (they are regions that are part of sovereign Russia, as Truss later made clear in an interview with the Russian outlet RBC). And online, Russians also made light of an especially serious moment: The over five-hour-long meeting between Putin and Macron. Macron's Moscow trip represented the most serious potential diplomatic opening in a weeks-long crisis, but it was the 20-foot long table that separated the two leaders in the Kremlin (after the French leader declined the Kremlin's request for a Russian Covid-19 test) that launched a thousand memes. One of those memes featured Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of the Chechen Republic, dancing on the massive table. It was a reminder that Putin still has domestic headaches to worry about, such as the regional leader apparently taking the law into his own hands -- not just in his home territory, but beyond it. In a conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the idea that Kadyrov was out of control, but he declined to give a readout of a meeting between Putin and Kadyrov, and had to bat away a journalist's question about whether the Kremlin feared Kadyrov. ""Why should Putin be afraid of the head of the Russian region?"" Peskov said. But the Kremlin does care about ratings, and Putin must certainly be mindful of the fact that a major war with Ukraine -- with potential massive casualties, broadcast to the world -- could conceivably be unpopular, unlike Russia's 2014 Crimea annexation, which was swift, relatively bloodless and provided a major boost to the Russian President's ratings. Divining Putin's intentions in Ukraine is an impossible task, and anyone who claims to know is a fool. But if conflict is averted, might public opinion be a factor? Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center suggested as much in a conversation with CNN's Kim Brunhuber. ""A real war could be unpopular. Until now, military operations were quite popular and the approval rating of Putin was based on the support after military operations [that were] successful, short, triumphal, just like Crimea, which provoked a wave of patriotism."" ""But right now we are talking about a bloody war, which will not be short, which will not be without victims, just like it was when Putin took Crimea. And this is another story,"" Kolesnikov said. Whether that tragic story plays out, then, is anyone's guess but Putin's.",4,4.1451692648584615,3.7064166409889605,0.438752623869501,17

In a roughly hour-long phone call, the White House said Biden made clear to Putin what he would be risking with an invasion. A senior administration official told reporters following the call that the discussion was substantive but the US fears Russia may still launch a military attack anyway. ""President Biden was clear that, if Russia undertakes a further invasion of Ukraine, the United States together with our Allies and partners will respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs on Russia. President Biden reiterated that a further Russian invasion of Ukraine would produce widespread human suffering and diminish Russia's standing,"" the White House said in a statement, adding Biden ""was clear with President Putin that while the United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy, in full coordination with our Allies and partners, we are equally prepared for other scenarios."" The call between the two leaders comes hours after the US moved some of its forces out of Ukraine and ordered the evacuation of most of its embassy staff on Saturday as fears mount that a Russian invasion of the country could take place in the next few days. The moves were yet another sign that the US fears Putin could order an invasion at any time, just one day after Biden's national security adviser warned Americans in Ukraine to leave and that military action could begin with an aerial bombardment that could kill civilians. A senior administration official told reporters Saturday afternoon that the call between the two presidents was ""professional and substantive,"" but ""there was no fundamental change in the dynamic that has been unfolding now for several weeks."" ""The two Presidents agreed that our teams will stay engaged in the days ahead,"" the official told reporters after the call. ""Russia may decide to proceed with military action anyway. Indeed, that is a distinct possibility."" The official said that Biden reiterated the US' ideas on how to enhance European security while also addressing some of Russia's security concerns, but noted that it ""remains unclear whether Russia is interested in pursuing its goals diplomatically."" Asked whether Russia has made a decision to invade, the official said, ""I think the honest answer to that question is we don't have full visibility into President Putin's decision making."" ""But you know, we are not basing our assessment of this on what the Russians say publicly,"" the official continued. ""We are basing his assessment on what we are seeing on the ground ... which is a continued Russian buildup on the border with Ukraine, and no meaningful evidence of de-escalation, or really of any interest in de-escalation."" Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov described the call Saturday as ""balanced and businesslike,"" but said the US and NATO had failed to address Russia's main security concerns. Ushakov said the conversation ""took place in an atmosphere of hysteria about the supposedly imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine by American officials, everyone knows this."" Ushakov added: ""The pressure around the topic of the invasion was carried out in a coordinated manner and the hysteria has reached its climax."" According to Ushakov, Biden told Putin he was ""committed to the diplomatic path and had laid out a range of considerations that he sees as addressing many of Russia's concerns."" Putin said the US and its allies had been ""pumping up"" Ukraine with new weaponry and encouraging provocations by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region and in Crimea, Ushakov said. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had on Friday accused Western countries and the press of spreading a ""large-scale disinformation campaign"" about an allegedly impending Russian invasion of Ukraine ""in order to divert attention from their own aggressive actions."" ""At the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, the global information space faced a media campaign unprecedented in its scale and sophistication, the purpose of which is to convince the world community that the Russian Federation is preparing an invasion of the territory of Ukraine,"" the Ministry said in a statement published on its website. All eyes on Ukraine The US has estimated that Russia has more than 100,000 troops near the Ukraine border, with thousands added just this week, according to an administration official. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Friday that a Russian assault on Ukraine could begin soon, beginning with aerial bombings and missile attacks. He advised all Americans in Ukraine to depart the country for their own safety as quickly as possible. ""We obviously cannot predict the future, we don't know exactly what is going to happen. But the risk is now high enough and the threat is now immediate enough that this is what prudence demands,"" he said. In Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko outlined preparations the city is taking to safeguard ""critical and social infrastructure facilities"" in ""the event of a possible emergency."" In the statement issued on Telegram ahead of the weekend, Klitschko said, ""Our efforts are aimed at preventing or overcoming both possible provocations and withstanding a military attack."" The senior administration official on Saturday said that US will continue, and even increase, its support for Ukraine to help it defend itself should Russia continue to escalate its aggression. ""As to our plans going forward, I think President Biden and other officials have been clear, that should Russia continue down the path to escalation, the United States will continue to increase our support to Ukraine, to enable it to defend itself, and you know, that approach has not changed,"" the official said. The call on Saturday was the latest attempt at diplomacy between the two leaders aimed at de-escalating the situation. Putin and Biden had last spoke on the phone late last year. Prior to that, on December 7, they had negotiations via video-conference. The first face-to-face meeting between Putin and Biden as heads of state took place in Geneva in June 2021. The Russian President has also engaged a series of Western leaders in talks that have so far appeared fruitless in defusing the situation. The attempts at diplomacy with the Russians would continue, the senior administration official said. ""We remain committed to keeping the prospect of de-escalation through diplomacy alive,"" the official said. ""But we're also clear eyed about the prospects of that, given the readily apparent steps Russia is taking on the ground in plain sight, right before our eyes. The stakes of this are too high not to give Russia every chance to avoid an action that we believe would be catastrophic. So as always, we continue along two paths."" Biden, who is spending the weekend at Camp David, took part in a virtual meeting from the White House on Friday with leaders from Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, NATO, the European Commission and the European Council to discuss escalating tensions. Along with the US, several other countries are calling for their citizens to leave Ukraine immediately as well.

2022-02-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/europe/russia-ukraine-invasion-paths-map-cmd-intl/index.html,Russia has surrounded Ukraine on three sides. Here's where an invasion could be launched,"Russia has amassed more than 130,000 troops near Ukraine's border in recent weeks, according to US estimates, raising fears from Western and Ukrainian intelligence officials that an invasion could be imminent. As frantic diplomatic efforts are made to avert war, Russia announced Tuesday that some of its troops would return to base after completing recent drills on Ukraine's doorstep, but said that major military exercises would continue. Still, Western leaders and analysts are warning that Russia's military poses an immediate threat to Ukraine. If an invasion were to occur, it is not clear where it would begin. Russia has created pressure points on three sides of Ukraine -- in Crimea to the south, on the Russian side of the two countries' border, and in Belarus to the north. Here are the three fronts Ukraine and the West are watching, and the recent Russian movements detected in each. Eastern Ukraine Most attention has been paid to the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists have been in conflict since 2014. The foremost assumption of those watching Russian movements is that Moscow could boost the military might it already possesses in the region, therefore making eastern Ukraine the easiest position from which to launch an invasion. Satellite imagery obtained by CNN shows that a large base at Yelnya, which held Russian tanks, artillery and other armor, has been largely emptied, with the equipment apparently being moved much closer to the frontier in recent days. Large amounts of weaponry were moved to the base late in 2021 before disappearing -- including some 700 tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and ballistic missile launchers. Social media videos since show some of that equipment on trains and roads much further south in the Bryansk region, which is close to Ukraine. The armor and vehicles are identifiably from the same units that had pre-positioned at Yelnya. Stephen Wood, senior director at satellite imagery company Maxar, told CNN: ""It looks to me like a considerable amount of the vehicles [tanks, self-propelled artillery and other support vehicles] have departed from the northeastern vehicle park; additional armored vehicles departed from the more central vehicle park."" Meanwhile, heightened activity in the Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts, which border northeastern Ukraine, has added to concerns. ""We are seeing a massive influx of vehicles and personnel in Kursk,"" Konrad Muzyka, an expert in tracking military movements with Rochan Consulting, warned on Twitter. Phillip Karber of the Potomac Foundation in Washington, who has also studied Russian troop movements in detail, told CNN this month: ""Russia's strongest offensive formation -- the First Guards Tank Army, which is normally stationed in the Moscow area -- has moved south 400 kilometers (250 miles) and is assembling in the optimum area for a rapid armored offensive on the Khursk-Kyiv invasion route."" Belarus Concerns have also grown over a vast build-up of Russian troops in Belarus, a country closely allied to Moscow that could provide another way into Ukraine. Russia and Belarus began 10 days of joint military drills on February 10, the size and timing of which has sparked fears in the West. Moscow's deployment into Belarus is believed to be its biggest there since the Cold War, with ""an expected 30,000 combat troops, Spetsnaz special operation forces, fighter jets including SU-35, Iskander dual-capable missiles and S-400 air defense systems,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on February 3. It is also the largest exercise the Belarusian armed forces have conducted at any time of year, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed the purpose of the drills, called ""Allied Resolve-2022,"" included repelling ""external aggression."" Some fear the build-up points to a Russian plan to surge towards Kyiv from the north. One European diplomat told CNN earlier this month that the massing of forces is a ""big, big worry,"" noting this would be the missing piece that Moscow would need to launch a quick attack on the Ukrainian capital. The joint drills would also provide cover for a flanking movement through Belarus and into northern Ukraine, CSIS warns. Satellite images released by Maxar in early February appeared to show that Russia's military had advanced deployments at several locations in Belarus. The deployments are likely linked to the joint exercises, but other photographs show camps being established close to the border with Ukraine, hundreds of miles from where the exercises are taking place. Troops and equipment deployed to an area near the Belarusian city of Rechitsa -- less than 30 miles (45 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine -- appeared on February 14 to have departed, though it was not clear to where, according to the Maxar imagery. But if Russia were to focus on the Belarusian border as its entry point to Ukraine, the route would be fraught with difficulties. Russian soldiers would have to negotiate the Pinsk Marshes, also known as the Pripet Marshes, one of Europe's largest wetlands, which straddles the border between Belarus and Ukraine -- a dense, waterlogged and densely forested terrain stretching across 104,000 square miles. That region impeded Nazi forces during Operation Barbarossa, Germany's doomed invasion of the Soviet Union, in 1941. According to the Institute for the Study of War, ""the marshes can be difficult, in some places likely impossible, for mechanized forces to traverse when wet."" Crimea The peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014 would provide a natural staging ground for any new operation, but it is unclear whether Moscow would attempt to launch a move into Ukraine from Crimea. At least 60 helicopters have landed within the past few days at a previously vacant airbase at Donuzlav Lake on the northwest coast of Crimea, according to Maxar's satellite images dated February 13. The arrival of the helicopters coincides with a major Russian naval exercise in the Black Sea, involving more than 30 ships. And large deployment of troops and equipment have been observed by Maxar, which assesses that more than 550 troop tents and hundreds of vehicles have arrived north of the Crimean capital, Simferopol. A new deployment was identified by Maxar for the first time on Thursday near the town of Slavne on the northwest coast of Crimea, including armored vehicles. Those new deployments were observed on the same day that several Russian warships arrived in Sevastopol, Crimea's main port. The Russian Defense Ministry posted images Thursday of six large amphibious landing ships at the port. Ukraine's Navy responded that ""Russia continues to militarize the Black Sea Region, transferring additional landing ships to put pressure on Ukraine and the world."" Ukraine's naval forces ""are ready for development of any scenarios and provocations, to defend the country from the sea,"" it added. Any move into southern Ukraine could be aided by troops in Transnistria, the Russian-supported breakaway region of Moldova, where build-up has also been reported. CSIS analysts say Russian troops could attempt a coup de main on Odessa, a Ukrainian port city the northwest of Crimea, by ""sailing its amphibious ships straight into Odessa's port and moving directly into the city."" It calls such a move ""a high gain but also a high-risk operation."" Odessa is a well-populated city and urban combat there would favor those defending it, while Russian forces would need to eliminate Ukraine's air defenses and then link up with troops arriving from the east of the country.",4,4.313597742639539,4.741856424558755,-0.4282586819192158,16
2022-02-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/politics/ukraine-russia-washington-white-house/index.html,Biden and Putin will talk Saturday as US warns Americans to leave Ukraine in 48 hours over fears of Russian attack,"President Joe Biden plans to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, a person familiar with the matter said, as the US warns Russia could attack Ukraine using bombs and missiles at any moment. The high-stakes talks come at what US officials describe as a critical juncture in the ongoing crisis. A significant increase of Russian ground forces and military assets have surrounded Ukraine, and Putin could decide at any moment to activate them into a deadly invasion. He hasn't decided whether to act, the White House said Friday. But that has not stopped American officials from dramatically increasing their warnings an attack is now a ""distinct possibility"" and could occur swiftly. Biden's phone conversation with Putin -- scheduled for 11 a.m. ET Saturday, according to the Kremlin -- will be his first since the end of December. Since then, the number of Russian troops near Ukraine has increased and the prospects of an invasion have increased, according to American intelligence assessments. Putin has also engaged a series of Western leaders in talks that have so far appeared fruitless in defusing the situation. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Friday accused Western countries and the media is spreading a ""large-scale disinformation campaign,"" which promotes the thesis about an allegedly impending Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""At the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, the global information space faced a media campaign unprecedented in its scale and sophistication, the purpose of which is to convince the world community that the Russian Federation is preparing an invasion of the territory of Ukraine,"" the Ministry said in a statement published on its website, accusing Western nations and media outlets of spreading disinformation ""in order to divert attention from their own aggressive actions."" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Friday the two men would speak by phone but didn't specify when. The President was planning the spend the weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat. Earlier Friday, Sullivan warned a Russian assault on Ukraine could begin soon, beginning with aerial bombings and missile attacks. He advised all Americans to depart the country for their own safety as quickly as possible. ""Any American in Ukraine should leave as soon as possible, and in any event in the next 24 to 48 hours,"" Sullivan said. ""We obviously cannot predict the future, we don't know exactly what is going to happen. But the risk is now high enough and the threat is now immediate enough that this is what prudence demands."" ""If a Russian attack on Ukraine proceeds, it is likely to begin with aerial bombings and missile attacks that could obviously kill civilians without regard to their nationality. A subsequent ground invasion would obviously involve the onslaught of a massive force,"" he continued. The warning came just before a senior defense official told CNN that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had ordered 3,000 more soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division to deploy to Poland, joining the 1,700 already there. The soldiers are there to help Americans who may try to leave Ukraine. The State Department is calling Americans in Ukraine to find out if they have plans to leave as the US continues to urge Americans to leave the country. Lee Humerian, an American living in Ukraine with his family and working as a missionary, told CNN that he got a call from the State Department Friday, asking if he had plans to leave the country. The official asked if he read the most recent email from the State Department encouraging Americans to leave, according to Humerian. He told the official he had read it and he did not have plans to leave. Humerian registered with the State Department's program that tracks Americans abroad. The State Department did not immediately respond to request for comment about these calls. Despite those warnings, Sullivan added that it's not clear if Putin has decided to invade Ukraine. ""I want to be crystal clear. A final decision has not been taken by President Putin, but we have a sufficient level of concern based on what we're see on the ground and what our intelligence analysts have picked up that we're sending this clear message and it remains a message that we have now been sending for some time. And it is an urgent message because we're in an urgent situation,"" Sullivan said. Later, he said there was a ""very distinct possibility"" that Russia would act militarily, but couldn't pinpoint when or how. ""I'm not going to get into intelligence information, but if you look at forces in both Belarus and in Russia on the other side of the Ukrainian border from the north and from the east, the Russians are in a position to be able to mount a major military action in Ukraine in day now,"" he said. Earlier Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US believes a Russian invasion of Ukraine could begin ""at any time,"" including during the ongoing Olympics in Beijing. He also said the US continues ""to see very troubling signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border."" Abrupt Situation Room meeting On Thursday evening, Biden's aides attended an abruptly scheduled meeting in the basement Situation Room that was called in the context of Russia's escalating military buildup. It had not been organized in advance, a source familiar with the meeting said. Biden joined for part of the meeting. Afterward, officials began warning publicly that Russia could invade Ukraine before the end of the Beijing Olympics, which conclude February 20. ""We continue to see signs of Russian escalation including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border. As we've said before, we are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time should Vladimir Putin decide to order it,"" Sullivan said Thursday. ""I do want to be clear, it could begin during the Olympics, despite a lot of speculation that it will only happen after the Olympics."" ""Russians are in a position to be able to mount a major military action in Ukraine any day now,"" Sullivan said. The urgent messages from Biden's top aides came a week after the administration had decided to no longer use the word ""imminent"" to describe the likelihood of an invasion. ""I used that once. I think others have used that once. And then we stopped using it because I think it sent a message that we weren't intending to send, which was that we knew President Putin had made a decision,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said. US planning to pull observers from Ukraine, send troops to Poland The fears over an invasion has led to the US planning to pull its impartial observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission in Ukraine as the security environment deteriorates, two sources familiar with the discussions said. The Biden administration is also discussing the possibility of further reducing the number of staff at the US Embassy in Kyiv and pulling other US government employees out of Ukraine amid new US intelligence suggesting that Russia could move to attack Ukraine prior to the end of the Beijing Olympics next week. The US has estimated that Russia has more than 100,000 troops near the Ukraine border, with thousands added just this week, according to an administration official. ""We're continuing to draw down our embassy,"" Blinken said during a press conference on Friday. ""We will continue that process. And we've also been very clear that any American citizens who remain in Ukraine should leave now."" OSCE observers' ""main tasks are to observe and report in an impartial and objective way on the situation in Ukraine; and to facilitate dialogue among all parties to the crisis,"" according to their website. They also have been responsible for tracking ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine. The US last month ordered the departure of diplomats' family members from the US Embassy in Kyiv and allowed nonessential personnel to leave on a voluntary basis. CNN has reached out to OSCE and State Department for comment. As the plans are made for the observers are made to leave Ukraine, the troops from the 82nd Airborne will be heading to neighboring Poland. The soldiers will fall under the command of Maj. Gen. Christopher Donahue, who was the commander of forces during the final evacuation and withdrawal from Afghanistan. Three hundred members of the 18th Airborne Corps have also arrived in Germany, the official said. They are under the command of Lt. Gen. Michael Kurilla, who's slated to be the next head of US Central Command. This group of 5,000 troops will ""reassure our NATO allies, deter any potential aggression against NATO's eastern flank, train with host-nation forces, and contribute to a wide range of contingencies,"" the senior defense official said. On Wednesday, CNN reported that the White House has approved a plan for members of the 82nd Airborne in Poland to help Americans who may try to leave Ukraine. The troops will begin setting up processing areas and temporary shelters. 'The risk of conflict in Europe is real' Biden on Thursday urged Americans in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, warning that ""things could go crazy quickly"" in the region. ""American citizens should leave now,"" Biden said in an interview that was taped Thursday with NBC News' Lester Holt. The President spoke with the leaders from Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, NATO, the European Commission, and the European Council in a call that lasted more than an hour Friday morning. Some leaders on the call later expressed concerns about the risk of invasion and urged the redoubling of diplomatic efforts with Russia. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement that ""the risk of conflict in Europe is real."" ""Participants made clear that any further Russian aggression against Ukraine would come at a high cost, while reiterating that they were ready to continue dialogue with Russia,"" he said. A Downing Street spokesperson said United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told allies on the call that he feared for the security of Europe due to the situation in Ukraine. ""He impressed the need for NATO allies to make it absolutely clear that there will be a heavy package of economic sanctions ready to go, should Russia make the devastating and destructive decision to invade Ukraine,"" the spokesperson said. Later Friday, a British diplomat told CNN that staff are not evacuating the British Embassy in Kyiv, but they are ""temporarily removing all nonessential staff and dependents"" and ""a core team will remain to continue with essential duties."" The French government said in a statement that the leaders on the call with allies discussed Russian military exercises that recently began in Belarus, stating that the ""leaders remain extremely vigilant in this regard.""

2022-02-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/politics/biden-administration-russia-intelligence/index.html,How the Biden administration is aggressively releasing intelligence in an attempt to deter Russia,"For months, the Biden administration has fueled alarming headlines and surprised Washington with a remarkable drumbeat of official disclosures of previously classified intelligence revealing Russian moves as Moscow masses troops on the Ukrainian border. Administration officials tell CNN the disclosures have been carefully coordinated among the National Security Council, the intelligence community and other national security agencies in an effort to disrupt Russian planning, blunt the effectiveness of any ""false flag"" operations and, ultimately, deter military action. And there are signs the strategy is working, US officials say. The Biden administration believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has been caught off guard by some of the releases, according to one senior US official, and intelligence intercepts have picked up Russian military and intelligence officials grumbling about the exposure of their plans, CNN has previously reported. ""The hope is that the Russians are surprised about the allied knowledge of these things, and that they have an internal reaction,"" a senior Western intelligence official told CNN. ""Usually, what you'd expect to see would be the Russians wondering if they have a mole."" ""That's useful to make them doubt themselves. It's useful to make them question whether they can actually execute some of these plans and still have secrecy and surprise,"" this person continued. ""Sometimes, if you put enough doubt in the system, they may actually remove some competent people who they suspect of being spies who, in fact, aren't spies at all."" Although the United States has downgraded and publicized classified information in the past in service of other foreign-policy goals -- sometimes effectively; sometimes, as in the run-up to the Iraq War, disastrously -- the sheer volume of disclosures makes Biden's approach to the slow-rolling crisis notable. Clashes with the media The strategy has also led to clashes with the US media over the administration's unwillingness to show proof of its claims. The disclosures have largely come in the form of statements from agency spokesmen and officials have provided little by way of evidence -- in effect, asking reporters to report the material without confirmation. (Other media reports on the crisis, of course, have come from conventional reporting and unauthorized leaks.) ""If you doubt the credibility of the US government, of the British government, of other governments and want to, you know, find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said when challenged last week. He subsequently called the reporter in question to apologize. Last week, spokespeople for multiple US agencies said the US had intelligence showing Russia planned to release a scripted video showing staged attacks by Ukrainian forces to drum up a pretext for military action. In January, the US said it had credible information indicating Russia had prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a separate false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine. And in December, the White House released a declassified document that said Russia was planning an offensive in early 2022 involving up to 175,000 troops. Officials have also been remarkably detailed in public about the number of Russian troops they see amassed on the border -- intelligence that has been backed up by commercial satellite imagery released by private companies. ""We're not instrumentalizing the press. What we're doing is conducting a strategic communications campaign,"" the Western intelligence official said. ""Keep in mind that there are many potential audiences of these disclosures, whether they're made from the podium or they're made in a background briefing or in other formats. I would judge that the State Department was probably also trying to tell the American people that 'This is the nature of this crisis. This is what we see.' "" The tactic has some high-profile Cold War precedents. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy's administration released photographs of Soviet ballistic missiles positioned in Cuba amid the escalating crisis there, in part to convince a skeptical press corps in the US and the UK. In 2022, the goal is more operational: It's an effort to deny Russia the same element of surprise that it took advantage of in 2014, when it annexed Crimea. Many of the same US officials in government now had front row seats to the decision-making in 2014 and are ""absolutely"" responding to lessons learned from that experience, Western diplomats told CNN. In 2014, Western officials were caught flat-footed by Russia's denials that it was sending unmarked troops into the peninsula ahead of the actual assault, according to one Western diplomat. Officials told reporters on background that they were skeptical of the ""little green men"" on the ground, but did not go on the record to counter Russia's denials. The United States has long struggled to respond to Russia's use of so-called ""grayzone"" warfare tactics -- things like disinformation and false-flag operations -- which the US military historically isn't set up to carry out or counter. Intelligence officials have for decades debated how and when to make early disclosures of intelligence to disrupt those sorts of asymmetric tactics. Those discussions have only escalated as Putin's Russia has capitalized on the digital age to conduct sophisticated information warfare, current and former officials say. But the Biden administration's strategy of repeated disclosures offers one of the first sustained examples of a relatively new and untested doctrine. ""The new doctrine is the potential to use intelligence as an information operations weapon,"" said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who noted that the Obama administration had made similar disclosures after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Case-by-case basis The releases have also drawn attention because much of the information could not have been learned from satellite images alone -- which are often duplicated in public channels -- instead signaling clear US access to Russian military and intelligence channels. Satellite images offer comparatively limited insights, current and former intelligence officials note. It's impossible to glean Putin's intent from mere tank formations, which can be used as decoys. US officials are aware that Russian military doctrine explicitly embraces deception -- a concept known in Russian as ""maskirovka,"" or ""masking."" But the intelligence releases on alleged false-flag operations are also the riskiest to the United States, former officials say. ""Obviously, the downsides to doing stuff like this is, 'Is whatever source we got that from going to dry up on us?' "" Clapper said. ""That's always the risk-gain assessment that you have to do."" Another source familiar with the intelligence admitted that he has been ""personally a little surprised at how much has been publicly revealed, though I can appreciate the balance between revealing Russian schemes and burning sensitive sources and methods."" Current US officials say the decision to downgrade any one piece of information has gone through normal processes, led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and that no disclosure has been made that could expose the means by which the United States gathered the information in the first place. ""The intelligence community used its standard declassification procedures, which are in place to protect sources and methods,"" said a US intelligence official. Meanwhile, an extraordinary amount of the Russian buildup has played out in public, freeing the administration to publicly discuss the kind of hard intelligence about troop numbers and force positioning that in past confrontations would have been classified. As commercial satellites have proliferated and advanced in recent years, high-resolution photos of Russian troop and tank formations that would once have been the sole purview of government satellites are now made public by private companies like Maxar. The strategy has also been part and parcel of a larger effort by the Biden administration to share intelligence to keep its partners and allies on the same page about the nature of the threat. ""I have never seen it work like this. It is a whole-of-government approach. US officials are thinking about who should we bring into the conversation in a very proactive way,"" said a State Department official familiar with the process. ""And a lot of these conversations about intelligence sharing are happening because certain countries just do not believe what we are saying is true."" Publicly, Russia has responded by flatly denying the American reports, characterizing them as propaganda and hysteria. ""So far, all these statements have been unfounded and have not been confirmed by anything,"" Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for Putin, said after a recent disclosure. Reporters, often explicitly recalling credulous reporting of Bush administration claims of intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq War, have pressed officials to provide evidence backing up the releases. In 2003, much of the intelligence deliberately released to reporters and the global community, alleging evidence that Saddam Hussein was reconstituting a nuclear weapons program, turned out to be grievously wrong -- in part thanks to the US reliance on a single, unreliable source. A National Security Council spokesman said Tuesday that the administration cannot make any of the underlying information public ""without compromising intelligence sources and methods,"" adding that ""there is value to the public in exposing these operations and to dissuading Russia from pursuing them."" Still, Biden's disclosures have broadly earned positive reviews as a judicious and effective use of intelligence, according to sources across the US government who are familiar with the underlying information. ""I think it's a good thing to do, because by diming out the Russians, particularly if you can do it preemptively, then you may prevent that very thing from happening -- and it would appear, at least so far, that may be the case,"" Clapper said.",20,4.172195409987625,4.056644050867849,0.11555135911977565,19
2022-02-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/europe/nato-troops-eastern-europe-map-intl-cmd/index.html,Here's where Alliance forces are deployed across Eastern Europe,"The threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine has placed heightened importance on the United States' and NATO's defenses across eastern Europe, which for decades have acted as a buffer between Russia and the West. NATO has four multinational battalion-size battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which operate on a rotational basis. Each is led by the UK, Canada, Germany or the US, and contains troops from several member countries. The alliance said last month that all four groups are ""robust and combat-ready forces."" Its Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has also said it is prepared to rapidly reinforce that presence further by sending additional forces and capabilities into the area. And the NATO deployments are supported by US troops. The US has its own bases in Lithuania and Romania, along with several in Poland. President Joe Biden last week formally approved the deployment of 3,000 more US troops to Poland, Germany and Romania, with 8,500 others personnel on heightened alert. NATO does not have any troops in Ukraine, and no plans have been announced to send troops from the alliance into the country. But although Ukraine is not a NATO member, the alliance also provides strategic-level advice to the country and has described the relationship as ""one of the most substantial of NATO's partnerships."" Other assets at NATO's disposal in the region include a missile defense system in Romania, designed to ""detect, track, engage, and destroy"" ballistic missiles in the atmosphere. A similar facility in Poland is set to become operational this year.",4,4.737166688695746,3.9813661890656014,0.7558004996301446,26
2022-02-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/politics/ukraine-russia-invasion-signs/index.html,What the US is watching that could signal Russia is launching an invasion of Ukraine,"It might be a cyberattack targeting Ukraine's energy grid. Or the movement of Russian battalions and tanks along the border and into firing range. Or perhaps even a long-range missile attack. They're all potential signs US and European officials are closely monitoring that could reveal President Vladimir Putin is moving forward with an invasion of Ukraine. With more than 100,000 Russian troops amassed along the Ukrainian border -- a number that continues to grow -- military and intelligence officials are scrutinizing the latest tactical maneuvers to try to anticipate when Moscow might shift from threatening an invasion to launching one. US officials say they're closely monitoring cyber intrusions, like the attack that hit Ukraine's government last month. They're watching not just Russian troops that amass on the border but where they're positioned, and they're keeping an eye on what Russia is doing with its equipment like tanks that would be central to any ground invasion. At the same time, current and former officials tell CNN that ultimately there may not be a clear tip-off for an attack on Ukraine. Like the rumbling of an earthquake, there may be little or no advance warning of an invasion before it's already underway, officials say. ""If you look at the lower-end options, all of which are executable immediately with little to no warning with the forces that are already deployed — things like a punitive strike or raid in the East, a breakout from the south, a raid from the north—those forces are already in position and in the right number with the right capability,"" a Western intelligence official told CNN. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told CNN that the US may not see the beginning of a whole-hog invasion until they see it. ""If he shoots into Kyiv or any other major cities, then you know it's a real deal,"" Clapper said. The assessment helps explain why President Joe Biden and top US officials have warned that a Russian invasion is imminent -- an explanation that angered Ukrainian officials -- because the Kremlin may need very little lead time before an attack is launched. Invasion could happen 'any day now' While the White House said it would no longer call a Russian invasion ""imminent,"" a senior administration official said the assessment that an attack could happen ""any day now"" remains valid as the Russians have added logistics and sustainment to their forces on the border, as well as additional offensive and defensive weapons. Russian officials have repeatedly denied they're preparing to invade Ukraine, accusing the West of being responsible for escalating tensions there. The White House on Wednesday approved a plan presented by the Pentagon for the nearly 2,000 US troops in Poland to help Americans who may try to evacuate Ukraine if Russia invades, according to two US officials familiar with the matter. The US forces are not currently authorized to enter Ukraine if a war breaks out, and there are no plans for them to conduct an evacuation like the US operation in Afghanistan last year, the officials emphasized. Biden has also suggested that Americans should leave Ukraine now, and State Department officials have said they may not be in a position to help Americans still in the country should Russia invade. Officials say there's a distinction between different potential scenarios, whether Russia attacks Ukraine in a targeted way or whether the Kremlin is preparing for a full-scale invasion of the country to try to overthrow the government in Kyiv. In the latter case, the Russians would need more troops along the border, officials say, and satellite images would capture the continued build-up that the West has watched for months now. ""I don't think the math is as simple as saying, there's a magical number of (battalion tactical groups),"" the Western official said. ""It's just generally speaking, more than we see now."" But officials cautioned that Putin could also begin by using long-range artillery to attack Ukraine, where ground forces would not need to be in range. Still, one of the key things the US is watching is for when a significant number of Russian forces leave their training areas near the border and move within firing range of their targets, which are specific ground positions, one administration official said. Another signal that US officials are monitoring is the movement of Russian tanks, one US official said. One sign the Russian military could be gearing up for an invasion is if they start moving around tanks on the border, or turning them on or off, the official said, because if they sit there and don't move for a few days the oil could freeze. If they are turning them on and off, it prevents that from happening -- meaning the tanks would be ready to go quickly. So far, the official said, the tanks are just sitting there, according to commercial satellite imagery. The weather in Ukraine could also play a role, the assessment being that colder temperatures -- and frozen terrain -- would make a Russian incursion easier. On alert for cyberattacks US and Ukrainian officials say there's a wide expectation that any Russian invasion could be carried out in conjunction with offensive cyber aggression toward Ukraine. Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian official who investigated the January cyberattack of Ukrainian government websites, said last month there was ""no doubt that (any Russian invasion) can be supported by cyber aggression — or at least they will stay active in cyberspace."" US officials are closely watching for any signs of cyberattacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure and are in touch with their Ukrainian counterparts on the issue, one US official told CNN. One concern is that Russia could use its hacking prowess to try to erode public confidence in the Ukrainian government. ""Could cyber be used to suggest the Ukrainian government is inept?"" the US official said. Since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, suspected Russian hackers have disrupted Ukrainian critical infrastructure on multiple occasions, including by cutting power in parts of the country in 2015 and 2016. ""Cyber is an ideal tool for Russia to use prior to an invasion,"" said John Hultquist, vice president of intelligence analysis at cybersecurity firm Mandiant, who closely tracks the Russian hacking group accused of the 2015 and 2016 disruptions. ""You can use (cyber operations) to be aggressive, to signal (intent) and potentially erode the influence of your adversary before bullets fly or without necessary escalating the situation to war."" Officials say Russia is already making use of so-called hybrid warfare techniques — unconventional tactics like cyberattacks, information warfare and the famous ""little green men"" that Russia famously relied on in the run-up to its 2014 assault on Crimea — making it difficult to pinpoint any one incident as a definitive signal that Moscow is preparing to escalate. The State Department claimed last week that Russia was prepared to fabricate ""a pretext for an invasion"" through a false-flag video. The Western official noted that Ukraine was hit by a cyber operation last month that did not precede a conventional Russian attack. ""This one of the hardest questions to answer it because the baseline level of activity is so high focused on Ukraine — and here I mean hybrid and cyber,"" the official said. ""A one-off may not be the indicator that we're looking for that a campaign is beginning.""",20,2.99115060400987,3.797827677544139,-0.806677073534269,9
2022-02-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/europe/russia-military-buildup-images-intl/index.html,New satellite images show continuing Russian military buildup on three sides of Ukraine,"New satellite images released by a US-based technology company appear to show continuing Russian military buildup in Crimea, western Russia and Belarus, as pressure continues to mount on Ukraine from three directions, underscoring fears that the Kremlin is planning an incursion into Ukrainian territory. In Crimea, a large deployment of troops and equipment was observed by Maxar in images collected Thursday, according to Stephen Wood, a senior director at the company. The deployment is at the formerly disused Oktyabrskoye airfield, north of the Crimean capital Simferopol. Maxar assesses that more than 550 troop tents and hundreds of vehicles have arrived at the site. Other sites in Crimea have also seen an influx of troops and equipment, including at Novoozernoye, where there have been extensive artillery deployments and training exercises. A new deployment was identified by Maxar for the first time near the town of Slavne on the northwest coast of Crimea, including armored vehicles. The new deployments in Crimea were observed on the same day that several Russian warships, including large amphibious landing ships, arrived in Sevastopol, Crimea's main port. The warships are expected to participate in scheduled naval exercises that would block off large parts of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, raising protests from Ukraine that commercial shipping routes would be choked. The Kremlin has denied that shipping routes will be blocked. The exercises are part of joint military drills by Russia and its ally Belarus, starting Thursday in Belarus' territory and expected to last 10 days. Moscow's deployment in Belarus is believed to be its biggest there since the Cold War, and the United States has expressed reservations about the buildup of Russian troops in the country, which shares a border with Ukraine. In Belarus, Maxar observed what it calls a ""new deployment of troops, military vehicles and helicopters"" at the Zyabrovka airfield near the city of Gomel, some 15 miles (25 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine. It is the first time helicopters have been seen in the area. There also appears to be a field hospital at the site. Additionally, troops and multiple battle groups remain deployed near the Belarusian city of Rechitsa -- less than 30 miles (45 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine. Previous satellite imagery had shown the establishment of tent encampments near Rechitsa. When combined with recent videos, they suggest a growing Russian presence in the area, which is some 200 miles (320 kilometers) east of where joint Russian-Belarus exercises got underway Thursday. Social media videos have shown substantial movements by Russian military units in the past few days to the east of Ukraine, around the cities of Kursk, Rostov-on-Don and Bryansk. Maxar reports what it calls ""a large deployment of troops and military forces"" that have ""recently arrived at the Kursk training area to the east of the city -- approximately 110 kilometers (75 miles) to the east of the border with Ukraine. "" ""Additional equipment continues to arrive in the area and preparations are being made to accommodate more troops and equipment,"" Maxar said. As Western nations look for diplomatic avenues to ease the crisis, US President Joe Biden urged Americans in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, warning that things could go sour very quickly. Speaking to NBC News' on Thursday, Biden said: ""It's not like we're dealing with a terrorist organization. We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly."" ""There's not"" a situation that could prompt him to send US troops to rescue Americans attempting to exit Ukraine, Biden told NBC, adding, ""that's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another."" HIs remarks came after a frosty exchange in Moscow between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. The latter described their talks as ""a dialogue of the deaf,"" while Truss warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would have ""massive consequences."" Discussion has turned to the Minsk Agreement, which was hammered out during talks in 2015 but never fully implemented, as a possible way out of the current crisis. But the Normandy Format -- a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France that has been aimingjoi to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014 -- failed to come to an agreement after nine hours of talks in Berlin on Thursday. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, despite Moscow's massive troop buildup in the region. The Kremlin is believed to have assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine's borders that Russia would need for a full-scale invasion, according to two US officials familiar with Washington's latest intelligence estimates.",4,3.0239939873744808,1.6354881637558734,1.3885058236186074,16
2022-02-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/europe/ukraine-russia-news-thursday-military-exercises-intl/index.html,Russia and Belarus hold joint military exercises as diplomatic talks ramp back up,"Russia and Belarus began 10 days of joint military drills Thursday amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis over fears that the Kremlin is planning an incursion into Ukrainian territory. The military drills, called ""Allied Resolve-2022,"" began in Belarus and will end February 20, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced Thursday in a statement. ""The purpose of the exercise is to work out the tasks of suppressing and repelling external aggression while conducting a defensive operation, countering terrorism and protecting the interests of the Union State,"" the statement said. Russia is also planning naval exercises that would block off large parts of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, raising protests from Ukraine that commercial shipping routes would be choked. The Kremlin has denied that shipping routes will be blocked. Moscow's deployment into Belarus is believed to be its biggest there since the Cold War, with ""an expected 30,000 combat troops, Spetsnaz special operation forces, fighter jets including SU-35, Iskander dual-capable missiles and S-400 air defense systems,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said last Thursday. The United States has also expressed concerns about the buildup of Russian troops in Belarus, a close ally of Russia. On Thursday, the top US general spoke with his Belarusian counterpart, marking the first time the two have had any official communication. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley tried to ""reduce chances of miscalculation"" in his call with Belarus Maj. Gen. Viktor Gulevich, according to a readout of the call. Milley has frequently spoken with NATO allies and European partners over the past few months. On Wednesday, he spoke with Lt. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the top Ukrainian general. It was the fourth time the two had spoken in about one month. But even as European leaders have held occasional talks with Russia, including French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the Kremlin earlier this week, most of the US engagement has been with allies and partners. Milley hasn't spoken to his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, since late-December. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, despite Moscow's massive troop buildup in the region. The Kremlin is believed to have assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine's borders that Russia would need for a full-scale invasion, according to two US officials familiar with Washington's latest intelligence estimates. On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry posted images of six large amphibious landing ships at the port of Sevastopol in Crimea, after they transited into the Black Sea earlier this week. Russia has declared a wide swath of the Sea of Azov and Black Sea unsafe as it performs missile and artillery fire exercises between February 14 and 19, the Ukrainian Naval Forces Command said in a Thursday statement shared by the Defense Ministry. ""By blocking the recommended sea lanes, the Russian Federation has made it literally impossible to navigate in these areas and allow ships to enter Ukrainian seaports, especially in the Sea of Azov, that is a clear violation of both the spirit and the conditions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea,"" it said. The planned exercises would restrict commercial traffic, warned Michael Carpenter, US ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, on Twitter. ""We see Russia escalating its brinksmanship by conducting provocative exercises along Ukraine's borders and in occupied Crimea, as well as in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. This chokes off commercial traffic in both bodies of water."" The Ukrainian Defense Ministry appealed for international help over the planned exercises off the Black Sea and Sea of Azov. ""We expect a strong response from the partners: when the Russian Federation's vessels will be not able to entry easily civilized ports, they will see the price for their impudence,"" Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in a statement. ""If there is no joint reaction from the world to these attempts of pressure, the Kremlin, and not just the Kremlin, could use such tactics around the globe,"" Reznikov said. The US Navy is increasing the presence of warships in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean amid rising concerns over the Russia-Ukraine crisis, according to a US defense official. Four US Navy Arleigh Burke-class destroyers have deployed in recent days to Europe to support NATO, the official said. Russia has denied that the exercises would block off shipping traffic. When asked to comment, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday: ""All military maneuvers and movements of Russian ships in the water area of the Black Sea are carried out in strict accordance with international regulations of maritime law."" The day before, Peskov said the military drills have scaled up as both Russia and Belarus face ""unprecedented threats"" from NATO. ""[The drills] are held regularly,"" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. ""Yes, the scale may be larger than before, but the situation is much more tense now."" Pressed further on the purpose and political meaning of these exercises, Peskov said both countries feel a growing threat from NATO. ""Yes, we can say so,"" Peskov said. ""Both Russia and Belarus are facing unprecedented threats, the nature and concentration of which, unfortunately, are now much higher and much more dangerous than before."" While Russian President Vladimir Putin is not scheduled to attend the drills, Gerasimov, the Chief of the Russian General Staff, arrived in Belarus ahead of the joint exercises, Russian state news agency TASS reported Wednesday. ""During the exercise, measures will be taken to strengthen the protection of the state border to prevent the penetration of armed groups of militants, block the channels for the delivery of weapons and ammunition, search, block, destroy illegal armed formations and sabotage and reconnaissance groups of a mock enemy,"" the Russian Ministry of Defense statement said. The drills are taking place around Belarus, including ""Domanovsky, Gozhsky, Obuz-Lesnovsky, Brestsky, Osipovichsky training grounds,"" while the ""airfields of Baranovichi, Luninets, Lida and Machulishchi are also involved,"" it wrote. Satellite images, taken Saturday, by US-based technology company Maxar showed camps being established close to the Belarusian border with Ukraine, hundreds of miles from where the exercises are taking place. More diplomacy The exercises begin as Western nations look for diplomatic avenues to ease the crisis. US President Joe Biden is expected to speak Friday with European and NATO leaders about Russia's buildup of troops near Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the plans. Biden spoke Wednesday with Emmanuel Macron about the French President's diplomatic efforts in Moscow -- after which the Kremlin poured cold water on reports that the two leaders had agreed to de-escalate the tense standoff on Ukraine's border. Press secretary Jen Psaki said she expected Biden ""will speak with a number of other European counterparts as the week proceeds."" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in an interview Thursday that a further round of talks between the countries in the so-called Normandy Format would be a ""good sign."" The Normandy Format is a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France that has been trying to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Talk has turned to the Minsk Agreement, which was hammered out during talks in 2015 but never fully implemented, as a possible way out of the current crisis. Advisers from all four countries are due to meet Thursday in Berlin to discuss tensions around Ukraine. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson met NATO's Stoltenberg in Brussels on Thursday, where the UK Prime Minister ""set out his plan to bolster UK military commitments to NATO"" by sending warships to Eastern Europe and increase the number of British fighter jets stationed in southeast Europe, ""to provide reassurance and support to allies in the region,"" according to Downing Street. ""Today I have agreed with the Secretary General a package of support to strengthen further our collective security, sending troops, planes and ships to defend NATO from north to south,"" Johnson said during a news conference. Johnson later traveled to Poland where he met Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. The leaders ""agreed that European security was vital for wider global stability and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions on the Ukrainian border,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss met in Moscow with her counterpart Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who gave a gloomy assessment of their talks. Lavrov called it a ""a dialogue of the deaf,"" saying at a joint press conference Russia was considering withdrawing non-essential diplomatic personnel from Ukraine. ""We are listening but we can't hear each other,"" he added. ""Our most detailed explanations fell on unprepared ground."" Truss in turn urged Russia to take a diplomatic route to avoid war over Ukraine. ""There is no doubt that the stationing of over 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border is directly put in place to threaten Ukraine,"" she said, noting that Russian authorities have also attempted to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine through cyberattacks and other activities. ""No one is undermining Russia's security. That is simply not true,"" Truss added. ""And it is perfectly proper for sovereign nations such as Ukraine to defend themselves and to seek defensive alliances.""",4,2.4861019132329436,3.0034934610370314,-0.5173915478040878,16
2022-02-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/europe/ukraine-russia-weather-climate-intl/index.html,Experts are speculating over Russia's next move. They may want to check Ukraine's weather forecast,"Even in the 21st century, warfare is affected by weather -- and that may become a factor in any Russian offensive into Ukraine. The question on the lips of Ukrainians, and maybe Russian generals: ""Has Rasputitsa come early?"" Rasputitsa is the term for the mud of spring, when travel in Russia and Ukraine by road becomes more difficult. Usually its impact is most felt in March, as the snows begin to melt. So far, this winter has been unseasonably mild in much of Ukraine. As CNN drove from the eastern port city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzia in central Ukraine on February 1, it began to rain. The driver shrugged in disbelief. ""Should be snow,"" he laughed. In Zaporizhzia, crusted banks of snow were melting into a trickle of brown water. Even at midnight, as a shroud of mist lay over the River Dnieper, the temperature hovered at freezing. Sleet turned to drizzle and back again. Military analysts are debating whether a continuation of the mild winter might affect any plans for an offensive. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it has any intent to attack Ukraine, but more than 100,000 Russian troops are gathered close to the borders of Ukraine, along with heavy weapons, tanks and ballistic missiles. Social media videos from several areas where Russian forces are deployed -- some posted by soldiers themselves -- show soft and flooded ground, and plenty of mud. Data from Copernicus, the EU's Earth Observation program, shows that much of eastern Europe experienced well-above-average temperatures in January. Ukraine saw temperatures between 1 to 3 degrees Celsius higher than the average of the past 30 years, one of many changes that the climate crisis has brought this region. Copernicus also notes that in January, ""eastern Europe was predominantly wetter than average"" and the soil in Ukraine was wetter than normal. The combination means less frost and more mud. That's no surprise to Svitlana Krakovska, head of the Applied Climatology Laboratory at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute in Kyiv. ""What we're seeing on a long-term trajectory is a lower number of days with snow cover as well as frost nights. We definitely see much stronger warming happening here than the global average,"" she told CNN. The US assessment is that a Russian incursion would be easier if the temperature falls. ""[Russian President Vladimir Putin] is going to have to wait a little bit until the ground is frozen so he can cross,"" US President Joe Biden said at a news conference last month. At a Pentagon briefing at the end of January, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said that when Ukraine's ""high water table"" freezes, ""it makes it for optimal conditions for cross-country tract and wheeled vehicle maneuver."" US officials have said Putin would understand that he needs to move by the end of March. But Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, says that ""while frozen ground would be a 'nice to have' for Russian forces, it's not a determining factor. It's important to keep in mind that precision-guided missiles and airstrikes are not influenced by this factor."" Russian forces have substantially improved over the last decade, says Massicot. The air force has acquired better targeting and communications -- and many of its pilots have gained combat experience in Syria. ""The Russian military trains year-round so they have experience with different weather conditions."" Russian tanks -- hundreds of which now sit within reach of Ukraine's border -- are not much impeded by soft ground, though they'd likely make quicker progress over frozen ground. Even so, armor moves only as fast as its logistical tail, vehicles that could be slowed by bad weather ""if they had to go off-road for some reason,"" says Massicot. She notes that Russia has forward-deployed logistical equipment to help overcome such problems, including recovery vehicles and bridging materials. Pontoon bridges have also been observed on rail convoys traveling into Belarus since late January. Ground conditions would matter more in some places than others. Eastern Ukraine is rolling farmland, ideal tank country. But the northern border with Belarus includes thousands of square miles of bog and marsh that would impede an attacking force (as it did the Nazis in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa.) According to the Institute for the Study of War, ""The marshes can be difficult, in some places likely impossible, for mechanized forces to traverse when wet."" Much depends on the sort and scale of military operation that Russia might have in mind. In the early stages of a conflict, air and missile attacks would be more important than a surge of mechanized units. ""The skies would not be a factor for Russian precision guided cruise or ballistic missiles, or even some of their more accurate long-range artillery systems,"" says Massicot, who was formerly a senior analyst at the Pentagon on the Russian military. ""Cloud cover is especially not a factor for fixed locations like military facilities or command and control where coordinates are known."" Russia has moved a substantial number of Iskander ballistic missiles, which have a range of about 300 miles (450 kms) close to Ukraine in the last month. In the east, Ukrainian frontline positions have not moved for years; missiles and long-range artillery could target them regardless of weather -- perhaps providing a breakthrough point for Russian armor. Attack aircraft, which would be tasked with attacking Ukrainian units on the move, would need relatively clear skies. So would planes for dropping air assault troops into the conflict zone; according to defense analysts Janes, ""multiple airborne forces (VDV) units have also been identified deploying into Belarus."" A low cloud-base hinders air operations as well as satellite reconnaissance, and might blunt Russia's considerable air superiority, making for what one military analyst called ""a fairer fight."" But it's a double-edge sword. Dense cloud (and night) cover would allow the Russians to move troops forward to start-lines without being detected from above. Should the Kremlin decide to attack, a period of bad weather followed by clear skies once operations are underway would be optimal. The skies would matter to the Ukrainians too. If they opted for a highly maneuverable defense, they would require airborne intelligence provided by the US and NATO to focus limited resources on key points to blunt the Russian advance. Of course, weather conditions are not the only -- nor the major - consideration for the Kremlin. The progress (or lack thereof) of negotiations on Russia's published demands sent to the US and NATO will likely be the decisive factor. Devising some justification -- a casus belli -- for going to war would provide important messaging for a skeptical Russian public. Shaping the information war is a key part of Russian strategy. A changing climate Krakovska, an author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report published last year, says there is a clear connection between climate change and Ukraine's changing winters. That's particularly pronounced in Eastern Ukraine, where winter temperatures are around 3 degrees Celsius warmer on average than they were in the 1960s. ""Thirty years ago, we would have had snow cover, especially in [eastern Ukraine], for at least three months of the cold season, and we'd have frost nights for around five months,"" Kralovska said. ""In 2020, we didn't really have a winter at all, just a few days were under zero, and we didn't have much snow, just a little."" Russian President Vladimir Putin used to be ambivalent about global warming. Back in 2003, he even said that ""Maybe climate change is not so bad in such a cold country as ours? 2-3 degrees wouldn't hurt."" More recently he has acknowledged the damage it is doing to Russia's environment. Now it might affect his generals' calculations. The winter weather in Ukraine can be fickle, but the outlook for the rest of February in Kyiv is milder than the average, local meteorologists say, with most daytime temperatures well above freezing and the very occasional splash of sunshine. Timko, Ukraine's very own groundhog, apparently thinks the Rasputitsa mud may be a little earlier this year. He didn't see his shadow when he emerged from hibernation last week.",7,3.953802304341509,5.520491894748791,-1.5666895904072824,13
2022-02-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/europe/ukraine-russia-news-tuesday-intl/index.html,"Russia pours cold water on Ukraine crisis de-escalation, as Macron meets with Zelensky","As French President Emmanuel Macron visited his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Tuesday for diplomatic talks on the country's crisis with Russia, Moscow indicated there were ""points of convergence"" laid out by Macron during his five-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin a day earlier. But the Kremlin has poured cold water on reports that the two leaders had agreed to de-escalate the tense standoff on Ukraine's border, where tens of thousands of Russian forces have massed in recent months, drawing warnings from Western officials of an impending invasion. The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday would not confirm any tangible steps toward a resolution, casting a cloud over the French president's shuttle diplomacy as he addressed the media in a joint press conference alongside Zelensky. Macron told journalists in Kyiv that his trip to Moscow had delivered concrete solutions for stability on the European continent and that Putin said he ""would not be the cause of an escalation."" He added that the Russian president had promised to respect the Minsk agreements, a ceasefire protocol signed by Ukraine and Russia in 2015 after Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a rebellion in Ukraine's east. Despite the agreement, the two sides have not seen a stable peace. Putin on Monday insisted in no uncertain terms that Zelensky must implement the peace plan in a press conference with Macron on Monday. ""Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,"" Putin said of Zelensky. Zelensky recently stated that he does not like a single point of the Minsk agreements, which requires Ukraine to give autonomy to two Russian-backed separatist regions in the country's east. To critics, the accord could give Moscow sway over Ukrainian politics. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: ""We are not his."" As Putin tests the West's resolve, Macron has thrust himself to center stage, taking former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's place as leading mediator for Europe as he readies himself for a re-election bid at home. Currently at the helm of the European Union's rotating presidency, Macron has spoken several times per week with Putin, and placed his third phone call in a week to Biden on Sunday evening. The Elysee Palace trumpeted a list of key takeaways from Macron's meeting with Putin, including Russia's ""commitment not to take new military initiatives, which allows for de-escalation"" and that Moscow would withdraw troops from Belarus. But when asked about the statement from the French presidency, Peskov said he did not know anything about it: ""I can't comment on it, I do not quite understand what French colleagues were talking about."" And though Putin's spokesman did confirm that Russian military forces will leave Belarus once joint exercises between the two countries conclude, he did not give further specifics or a sense of the timeline for withdrawal. Ukrainian intelligence officials fear Russia could use Belarus as a ""full-fledged theater of operations,"" having ramped up its military presence from several thousand troops in January to an estimated 30,000 sometime this month. ""We are talking about allied exercises, and it is understood that upon completion of these exercises, the troops will return to their permanent bases,"" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Asked if a concrete date had been given by Putin, Peskov said, ""No."" Based on the latest US intelligence estimates, Putin has assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons it would need for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but US officials say they still don't know whether Russia's leader has decided to launch an attack. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning an incursion, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat to Russia. Speaking at the joint press conference, Zelensky said: ""We stand for the de-occupation of our territory."" He added that the talks with Macron were ""fruitful."" Ongoing diplomacy As Russia deploys more troops onto Ukraine's border and the US moves thousands of forces to bolster NATO's eastern front, the Kremlin's noncommittal comments on Tuesday have put a damper on another busy diplomatic day for Macron. The French President also met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday in Berlin. Macron, who in 2019 said bluntly that Europe was facing the ""brain death of NATO,"" caused by American indifference to the transatlantic alliance, and has called on the EU to take on a larger role in Europe's defense, is now getting a chance to lay out his vision for what a Europe more independent from US influence might look like. Speaking alongside Scholz and Duda, Macron told reporters that diplomatic efforts in the last few days have ""allowed the emergence of new leads"" to de-escalate the tensions between Russia and Ukraine. He said the first objective of the ongoing diplomatic efforts is to ""avoid war."" The second objective, Macron said, is to ""defend Europe and its allies"" with the third being the defense of ""principles that have made Europe in the past 30 years, in particular the respect of the sovereignty of all states, the territorial integrity, and values."" Macron also reiterated the importance of dialogue with Russia to avoid any escalation and to ""build stability and peace on the long run."" To Moscow, Macron has presented himself as a ""quality interlocutor,"" as Putin described him, according to an official in the French presidency. The stakes could not be higher. Macron is seeking to stop the massive Russian military buildup of more than 100,000 soldiers from bubbling over into war and soothe Russia's security grievances. ""No one is naive,"" Macron told reporters Tuesday. ""France, since the beginning of this crisis, has never made excessive statements on the subject, but in the same way I do not believe that this crisis can be resolved by a few hours of discussion.""",4,3.496676090685907,3.1503087028156336,0.34636738787027355,26

As the United States moves forces to Eastern Europe to support its NATO allies and Russia deploys more troops onto Ukraine's border, Macron visited his counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, in Moscow on Monday to demand a de-escalation to the crisis, before traveling to Kyiv. The two men appeared at a press conference after spending more than five hours locked in head-to-head talks. Macron said that he and Putin were able to find ""points of convergence"" over the crisis and that it was ""up to us to agree, jointly, concrete and specific measures to stabilize the situation and to de-escalate tensions."" ""There is still time to preserve peace,"" Macron said. Putin, who had sharply critical words for NATO and Ukraine, suggested ""further steps"" were possible on the diplomatic front. ""A number of his proposals and ideas, about which it is too early to speak, I consider quite possible in order to lay a foundation for our further steps,"" Putin said, adding that the pair would speak again after Macron's trip to Kyiv on Tuesday. Despite the diplomatic overtures, Putin accused Ukraine of violating the rights of its Russian-speaking population and said that its government is ""ignoring all possibilities for a peaceful resolution of the situation in Donbas,"" referring to the separatist regions in Ukraine's east. Putin has assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons it would need for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, based on the latest US intelligence estimates, but US officials say they still don't know whether Russia's leader has decided to launch an attack. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning an incursion, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat to Russia. Macron praised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's ""sangfroid"" on Monday, saying that he has shown ""self-restraint"" in the face of growing Russian military activity on its borders. ""President Zelensky is the president of a country on whose borders there are 120,000 Russian troops, and I would say that that would make one worry,"" Macron said. The crunch talks between Putin and Macron came as US President Joe Biden met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Washington, DC on Monday. Ukraine was top of the agenda, Biden said. The US President said that the two leaders ""developed a strong package of sanctions that clearly demonstrate international resolve and impose swift and severe consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's sovereignty,"" warning that ""it cannot be business and usual if Russia invades."" While the Biden administration has sought to demonstrate a united Western front against Putin's aggression, Scholz has largely watched from the sidelines as the crisis escalates -- drawing criticism and questions over Germany's willingness to confront Moscow. On Monday, one key sticking point between the US and Germany appeared to remain: the future of the contentious Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is meant to bring natural gas from Russia to Germany. Biden was explicit the project wouldn't go forward if Russia invades Ukraine, however Scholz refused to even name the project during a news conference, and declined to commit to ending the pipeline if an invasion moves ahead. Scholz, who succeeded Angela Merkel in December, has, so far, taken a softer approach on Russia than the US and its allies. Germany has not joined the US, France, Spain and other allies in bolstering troops along NATO's eastern flank. It has also been reluctant to provide lethal aid, refusing to allow NATO ally, Estonia, to send German-made howitzers to Ukraine and drawing mockery for sending thousands of helmets instead of weapons. Some experts have suggested that the pipeline project may be the reason why it's not taking a more prominent role. In an apparent attempt to refute that criticism, Scholz will visit Russia and Ukraine later this month. As Putin tests the West's resolve, Macron has thrust himself to center stage, taking Merkel's place as leading mediator for Europe as he readies himself for a re-election bid at home. Currently at the helm of the European Union's rotating presidency, Macron has spoken several times per week with Putin, and placed his third phone call in a week to Biden on Sunday evening. According to a statement from the Elysee Palace, Macron and Biden agreed Sunday to capitalize on the ""positive progress"" made in the Normandy Format -- a grouping of France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia -- to bolster the Minsk agreements, a ceasefire protocol signed by Ukraine and Russia in 2015 after Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a rebellion in Ukraine's east. Despite the agreement, the two sides have not seen a stable peace.

To Moscow, Macron has presented himself as a ""quality interlocutor,"" as Putin described him, according to an official in the French presidency. The official told reporters Friday that among Macron's agenda for the talks was to try to balance ""the new order of security in Europe, including guarantees of regional security and the role and capacity of the European Union in taking charge of its own security,"" alongside his commitments to the US and NATO. The stakes could not be higher. Macron is seeking to stop the massive Russian military buildup of more than 100,000 soldiers from bubbling over into war and soothe Russia's security grievances, which include demands that Ukraine and Georgia be blocked from ever becoming members of the alliance and a drawdown of troops in the region. ""I'm reasonably optimistic but I don't believe in spontaneous miracles,"" Macron told reporters on the flight to the Russian capital, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV, which was traveling with the French president. Moscow, on the other hand, had been more cautious about the planned meeting.

The base is at Yelnya, southeast of the city of Smolensk and some 160 miles from the Ukrainian border. Large amounts of weaponry were moved there late in 2021 -- including some 700 tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and ballistic missile launchers. Much of that equipment is now gone, according to radar satellite imagery acquired on February 6. Cloud cover had prevented photographic imagery of the site for several days previously. The images show the tracks of departing vehicles. Stephen Wood, senior director at satellite imagery company Maxar, told CNN: ""It looks to me like a considerable amount of the vehicles [tanks, self-propelled artillery and other support vehicles] have departed from the northeastern vehicle park; additional armored vehicles departed from the more central vehicle park."" 'Entering the new stage of the build-up' Konrad Muzyka, an expert in tracking military movements with Rochan Consulting, says what has happened at Yelnya is one of several ""important changes in Russian force compositions and their locations."" He told CNN: ""We are entering the new stage of the build-up where we are seeing pre-positioned units being manned with additional personnel and that equipment is being moved probably to staging areas."" Social media videos shot in the last few days show some of that equipment on trains and roads much further south in the Bryansk region, which is close to Ukraine. The armor and vehicles are identifiably from the same units that had pre-positioned at Yelnya. ""We know that Yelnya hosts elements of the 41st army of the CMD [Russia's Central Military District] that arrived from Siberia last spring to a training ground near Voronezh and whose vehicles were later moved to Yelnya,"" Russian journalist Rusland Leviev of the Conflict Investigation Team (CIT), a Russian open-source intelligence group, told CNN. Social media videos around Bryansk show military vehicles with ""76"" and ""87"" codes on their number plates which denote the CMD, he pointed out. Leviev added that the CIT believes the vehicles are moving to Bryansk, ""because we saw two videos of the same convoy in Smolensk region and then in Bryansk region to the south,"" which the group geolocated against crowdsourced dashcam footage and satellite imagery. ""We also saw videos of several trains that were posted by social media users from Bryansk region. On the carriages we could read 8-digit identification codes, which, when checked against openly accessible databases, trace the train's origins to Yelnya."" ""This is important because those vehicles previously were several hundred kilometers away from the border, and now [they] are stopping in mere dozens [of kilometers away]."" Thomas Bullock, an analyst at Janes, wrote: ""There are now multiple indicators suggesting troops have begun deploying to forward camps to join up with their prepositioned equipment."" He also added that videos posted on social media indicate that troops from Siberia, whose equipment has already been moved to sites in Smolensk and Bryansk, are in the process of deploying. A US intelligence document dated December 3, 2021 included satellite imagery showing that the site at Yelnya was empty in June -- but by November was home to five Battalion Tactical Groups, each of which contains about 1,000 troops and supporting elements. Much of the equipment belongs to the 41st Combined Arms Army, which is normally based in Russia's CMD and has its headquarters in Novosibirsk in Siberia. Muzyka says there are substantial Russian movements elsewhere. ""We are seeing a massive influx of vehicles and personnel in Kursk,"" he tweeted Sunday. Kursk is some 70 miles (100 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine. Phillip Karber of the Potomac Foundation in Washington, who has also studied Russian troop movements in detail, told CNN: ""Russia's strongest offensive formation -- the First Guards Tank Army, which is normally stationed in the Moscow area -- has moved south 400 kilometers and is assembling in the optimum area for a rapid armored offensive on the Khursk-Kyiv invasion route."" On Sunday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told ABC News: ""We believe that there is a very distinct possibility that Vladimir Putin will order an attack on Ukraine. It could take a number of different forms. It could happen as soon as tomorrow or it could take some weeks yet."" Separately US officials told CNN at the weekend that Russian President Vladimir Putin has now assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine's borders he would need for a full-scale invasion of the country. This includes a growing force in southern Belarus. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any plans for a military offensive against Ukraine.",7,5.229827233965931,5.28463083186891,-0.054803597902978396,16
2022-02-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/politics/us-intel-russia-doubts-invasion-ukraine/index.html,US intel indicates Russian officers have had doubts about full scale Ukraine invasion,"Intercepted communications obtained by the US have revealed that some Russian officials have worried that a large-scale invasion of Ukraine would be costlier and more difficult than Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin leaders realize, according to four people familiar with the intelligence. Three of the sources said those officials include intelligence and military operatives. The officials have also grumbled about their plans being discovered and exposed publicly by western nations, two of the sources said, citing the intercepted communications. There is no evidence that these officials are opposed to the overall plan, or would revolt against Putin's orders, two of the sources said. Another source familiar with the US intelligence noted that Russia has a professional military that would be expected to effectively carry out Putin's orders. Still, Russian defense personnel believe it will be difficult, a senior European official said. ""In the assessments we see it is clear some people on the [Russian] defense side are not really understanding what the game plan is,"" the official said. The official added that the assessments suggest the defense personnel think ""it's a very difficult game plan to stand up."" Another of the sources familiar with the intelligence said that the way the Russian planning has evolved and expanded over the last two months suggests that the concerns have been heard by senior Russian officials. Officials told CNN on Saturday that Putin has now assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine's borders that he would need for a full-scale invasion of the country. Some assessments indicate that he may be planning to try to take Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, they said, and the city could fall within 48 hours of a large-scale land and air invasion. Another possibility, the officials said, is that Putin decides upon a multi-pronged operation, sending in forces from several directions across Ukraine to quickly fracture the Ukrainian military's ability to fight as a cohesive force -- a classic Russian military strategy. ""We've long said that Putin continues to add to his options and capabilities, and we've been equally transparent about some of the moves we believe he intends to make to justify some sort of military action,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told CNN Monday. ""We're also going to continue to help Ukraine better defend itself with both lethal and non-lethal assistance."" US officials publicly and privately say they still don't know whether Putin has decided to attack, and what form it would take if he did. That is largely because the US' visibility into Putin and his inner circle is still extremely limited, the sources told CNN. The US has fairly solid insights into the Russian military and foreign ministry, the sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN. Many of those personnel have been involved in the current buildup near Ukraine, which has afforded the US better-than-usual visibility into Russian planning. But the US intelligence community is still largely cut off from Putin and the most senior Russian officials, who are themselves typically isolated from the lower-level operatives carrying out Kremlin orders. Even so, many of the preparations have been overt and easier to spot. Russia has continued to build up its forces near Ukraine's borders, including more advanced deployments in Belarus and Crimea, according to satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies and provided to CNN. New housing and personnel camps have sprung up in the last two weeks, the images show. And the US has seen indications that Russia had begun erecting supply lines such as medical units and fuel that could sustain a drawn-out conflict should Moscow choose to invade, officials have previously told CNN. ""Given the type of forces that are arrayed ... if that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant, very significant, and it would result in a significant amount of casualties,"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley told reporters last week. ""You can imagine what that might look like in dense urban areas, along roads, and so on and so forth. It would be horrific. It would be terrible. And it's not necessary. And we think a diplomatic outcome is the way to go here."" Another US official assessed that the diplomatic path is narrower than ever, however. ""We are in Hail Mary territory,"" he said.",7,3.7316855545026213,3.5067096156761237,0.22497593882649758,0
2022-02-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/politics/homeland-security-terrorism-bulletin/index.html,DHS updates terrorism bulletin in the wake of recent violent events and Russia-Ukraine tensions,"The spread of conspiracy theories and disinformation is fueling the ""heightened threat"" environment in the United States, warns the latest national bulletin issued Monday by the Department of Homeland Security. The terrorism bulletin is in part a response to recent events, including a hostage attack on a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, and threats directed at historically black colleges and universities, as well as a shift in Russian influence campaigns related to Ukraine. This bulletin ""outlines the key factors that have increased the volatility, unpredictability, and complexity of the current threat environment, and highlights resources for individuals and communities to stay safe,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. For example, supporters of foreign terrorist organizations have encouraged copycat attacks following the attack last month on the synagogue in Texas, the bulletin says. And ISIS or its affiliates ""may issue public calls for retaliation due to the strike that recently killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi,"" according to the bulletin. The National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin is the principal way DHS informs the public about any changes to the terrorism landscape in the US. The last one, issued in November, was set to expire this week. Threats against the United States are increasingly unpredictable and complex amid a host of conspiracy theories, foreign interference and calls for violence, the new DHS bulletin says. Although Russia is not named in the bulletin, a senior DHS official said it is ""one of those foreign hostile powers that has engaged in a sustained level of information influence operations targeting the US."" Those efforts have in part been aimed at undermining credibility in the US government, the official added. Russia has promoted content through various means to US populations, particularly focusing on government response to Covid-19 and issues of race and immigration, as well as the 2020 election, according to the official. However, in recent months Russia has included messaging about Ukraine, according to a law enforcement source and a DHS memo that was shared with state and local officials in late January. Since September, Russia has also promoted narratives pointing to the US as the aggressor that is exacerbating the situation between Russia and Ukraine, according to the source. ""This campaign constitutes the most significant Kremlin-driven messaging campaign in the last year and we expect this to continue to increase as the crisis over Ukraine worsens,"" reads the memo, obtained by CNN. What stands out in Monday's bulletin, according to Thomas Warrick, director of the Atlantic Council's Future of DHS Project, is the emphasis on false and misleading narratives and conspiracy theories, originating with or amplified by foreign and domestic threat actors. ""Most notable in recent months have been Russian disinformation efforts relating to Ukraine,"" he said, adding that DHS and US intelligence officials have previously pointed to state actors Russia, China and Iran, as well as terrorist groups, for their efforts to mislead and confuse the US public. ""What is most important, as the DHS NTAS Bulletin advises, is for the American people to recognize that hostile nation-states and terrorist groups alike are trying to mislead the American people on a wide range of issues,"" he said. Last month, a 44-year-old British national held four people hostage at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas. All the hostages escaped and the attacker was killed after an hours-long standoff that prompted federal government outreach to Jewish communities across the US. The synagogue attack highlights the continuing threat of violence based on racial or religious motivations, as well as threats against faith-based organizations, the bulletin says. During and after Colleyville, DHS began seeing content posted online pointing to the attack ""as an example of the types of activities that lone offenders or others should be taking ... in support of ISIS or al Qaeda,"" the senior DHS official said. There was also an increase in calls for attacks among those who are supportive of Aafia Siddiqui, an al Qaeda operative who is in custody in Texas, and the hostage taker referenced, according to the official. Investigators believe the hostage taker may have been motivated by a desire to release Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year sentence, CNN previously reported. ""Ironically,"" the official said, there have also been calls on White supremacist platforms ""noting the events in Colleyville."" The primary terrorism threat to the US continues to be from lone offenders or small groups who are motivated by a range of foreign and domestic grievances ""often cultivated through the consumption of certain online content,"" the bulletin says. Both the Colleyville incident and the threats against universities and colleges are examples of continued calls for violence directed at US critical infrastructure, mass gatherings, faith-based institutions, institutions of higher education, racial and religious minorities, government facilities and personnel, and perceived ideological opponents, according to the bulletin. To combat the threats, DHS has been sharing information and intelligence with state and local officials, as well as impacted communities. While we are ""very concerned about a threat environment,"" the DHS official said, ""I feel that we are much better prepared to deal with that threat as it is evolving than we were, say, a year ago."" Mayorkas has called for a ""significant enhancement"" in the funding allocated for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which provides money to organizations to invest in physical security enhancements, for example, another DHS official said. The synagogue in Colleyville was a recipient of one of these grants. This story has been updated with further details.",20,5.924933498858402,7.6116439579884645,-1.6867104591300626,28
2022-02-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/europe/ukraine-chernobyl-belarus-intl-cmd/index.html,Ukrainians prepare for war at the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster,"It's a frigid Friday in Ukraine's Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, and dozens of journalists in fluorescent yellow vests are frantically elbowing each other as they vie for camera position in a town where no one has lived since 1986. Chernobyl has been abandoned since the world's worst nuclear disaster here three decades ago. But with tens of thousands of Russian troops amassing on Ukraine's border with Belarus just a few miles away, the ghost town is now playing host to security forces training for war. Ukraine is using Chernobyl to prepare for another potential cataclysm. Russian President Vladimir Putin has consistently denied that the Kremlin is planning an incursion into Ukraine. Russia's deployments in Belarus are ostensibly linked to joint exercises due to begin on Thursday. However, satellite photographs show Russian camps being established close to the border with Ukraine, hundreds of miles from where the exercises are taking place. If Russia were to invade Ukraine, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is a possible conduit to Kyiv. American and NATO officials say President Putin is steadily increasing his military presence in Belarus from 5,000 troops in January to an estimated 30,000 sometime this month. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that the deployment into Belarus is Russia's biggest since the Cold War, and many of those forces are just a two-hour drive from Kyiv. Propaganda battle The air is thick with sulfur as national guard troops clear the town of imagined enemy soldiers, firing hundreds of rounds of live ammunition into plywood cutouts in the windows of surrounding buildings. A sniper fires into an orange target high in an apartment block. A mortar is launched into a snowy clearing. An armored vehicle trundles past roadblocks to confront assailants held up in the second story of a building. More than 35 years ago, an explosion at the Vladimir Lenin Nuclear Power Plant forced a region-wide evacuation, sending radioactive fallout billowing across Europe. Thirty-one people died in the blast, while millions were exposed to dangerous radiation levels. Estimates of the final death toll from long-term health problems are as high as 200,000. Now, in training for war, Ukraine has brought the world's media along to see. Denys Monastyrsky, Ukraine's internal affairs minister, told journalists that security forces were using the Chernobyl exercises to demonstrate how far they have come in urban combat tactics since Russia annexed Crimea and pro-Russian separatists seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine nearly eight years ago. ""All these scenarios are taken and summarized from the cases that have occurred since 2014,"" Monastyrsky said. The spectacle, however, is also an attempt by Kyiv to match the glitzy propaganda effort coming out of Moscow. On the diplomatic front, Russia has repeatedly accused NATO of being the party responsible for the crisis, arguing the alliance's eastward expansion poses an existential threat. Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, is pumping out propaganda videos worthy of a Hollywood production, with tank columns driving at maximum speed across the frozen steppe and ground-attack fighters swooping into bases in southern Belarus. The exact nature of Russia's threat to Ukraine remains unclear and a point of contention. Ukrainian officials have spent much of the past few weeks playing down the US estimation that a Russian invasion could be ""imminent,"" concerned that the dire language was causing panic and destabilizing the economy. ""We have the same facts, but the different perception, or a different estimation,"" Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told CNN after watching the exercises in Chernobyl. The White House is no longer calling a potential invasion ""imminent"" due to concerns, they say, that the term suggests Putin has already made a decision to invade Ukraine. Nonetheless, Ukraine admits that Russia's military buildup in Belarus is worrying. 'Only a fool would start a war' War is far from the minds of many Ukrainians who live near the border where Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia meet. ""They've been saying 'a war is coming' for five years now,"" said one man who asked not to be named. ""Only a fool would start a war,"" he said. ""There won't be any winners."" At the Three Sisters Cafe, named for the three former Soviet republics, 64-year-old Masha pours espresso in paper cups for the weary drivers who wander in. Truck after truck is waiting to cross into Russia. Some are stuck for days, slowed by Covid restrictions. They have few options but to wait and sip a hot drink from the cafe. Masha is convinced: No war is coming here. ""It ain't gonna happen,"" she yells, waving her hand in the air. ""Will Putin go to war with civilians? He won't do that. Never in his life. It's all lies, politics. We don't even think about it."" She works in the cafe, she says, to supplement her pension, which is the equivalent of about $77 a month. She is less concerned with the geopolitical games being played by world leaders than the hardships of everyday life. ""If I could, I would have the Parliament dissolved,"" she said. ""They should have given the people proper pensions. So that people won't be beggars, paupers."" Peter Vujcic, a Serb truck driver old enough to remember war in his own country, is also unconcerned. Vujcic spoke to CNN while on his way to the Serbian capital, Belgrade, shortly after crossing Belarus' border with Russia. He said he's seen military hardware coming back and forth in the Belarus, but he's not worried about it. ""Everything will be fine,"" he said with a smile, leaning out of his cab window.",4,4.18142203054156,2.7912837030713207,1.3901383274702392,18
2022-02-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/06/europe/russia-military-images-intl/index.html,New satellite images show advanced Russian military deployments in Belarus,"New satellite images released by a US-based technology company appear to show that Russia's military has advanced deployments at several locations in Belarus, a move likely to concern Ukraine and NATO amid fears that the Kremlin is planning an incursion into Ukrainian territory. The deployments are likely linked to joint exercises between Russian and Belarus forces that are due to begin on Thursday. However, other photographs show camps being established close to the border with Ukraine, hundreds of miles from where the exercises are taking place. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, despite Moscow's massive troop buildup in the region. The Kremlin is believed to have assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine's borders that Russia would need for a full-scale invasion, according to two US officials familiar with Washington's latest intelligence estimates. However, it is unclear how long it would take Russian forces to ramp up further, or if they would need full capabilities in order to invade. The images from Maxar -- taken Saturday -- are consistent with recently posted social media videos showing Russian forces moving through Belarus and creating field camps within 20 miles of the Ukrainian border. Some of the imagery shows Belarus' Luninets airfield, where Russian fighter jets have deployed ahead of the exercises, dubbed Union Resolve 2022. Photographs show Russian S-400 air defense systems and Su-25 attack aircraft at the airfield. The Russian Defense Ministry released video on Saturday of the arrival of the planes at Luninets. One of the S-400 battalions has traveled from Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East, a journey of more than 5,600 miles (9,000 kilometers), according to Zvezda, a Russian Ministry of Defense publication. Other photographs from Maxar show Russian forces establishing themselves at some distance from where the exercises are planned -- including at Rechitsa, a Belarusian city about 170 miles (270 kilometers) east of Luninets close to where the borders of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine meet. The force gathered there includes tanks, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles. The images show that for the first time several tent encampments have been created at Rechitsa. That development and recent footage from the area suggest a growing Russian presence there. Videos posted to social media show Russian troops entertaining local people in Rechitsa, with music and demonstrations at an event called Two Nations, One History, One People. Several other images from Maxar show a growing Russian presence southwest of Rechitsa, and within 15 miles (25 kilometers) of the Ukrainian border, in rural areas close to the town of Yelsk. Maxar assesses the deployment near Yelsk to include short-range Iskander ballistic missiles, which have a range of about 250 miles (400 kilometers.) Analysts at IHS/Janes, a military intelligence firm, believe there are elements of at least three Russian Battalion Tactical Group at Yelsk. The massive troop buildup has caused alarm among US and European leaders. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that Moscow's deployment into Belarus is the biggest since the Cold War. One European diplomat called the massing of forces a ""big, big worry,"" noting this would be the missing piece that Moscow would need to launch a quick attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, which is less than two hours from the border of Belarus. Based on publicly available weather calculations, the optimal time for a Russian invasion would be while there is a hard ground freeze, so heavy equipment can readily move. US officials have said Putin would understand he needs to move by the end of March. The White House, however, has stopped saying a potential Russian invasion is ""imminent"" due to concerns that the term suggests President Vladimir Putin has already made a decision to invade Ukraine. ""We still don't know that he's made a decision,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week. Ukraine presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Sunday there was no evidence Russia will take ""critical steps for a full-scale invasion"" of the country, but added that Kyiv and its partners are preparing for any possible scenarios. ""The situation is completely under control. One way or another, we are not reducing the activity of diplomatic work to ensure a sustainable and full-fledged de-escalation,"" Podoliak told state media. He noted that the ""threatening concentration"" of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders remains, but stressed that it has been ""going on for several years.""",4,5.159627492309993,2.907416121512107,2.252211370797886,16
2022-02-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/05/politics/russia-military-ukraine/index.html,Russia has 70% of the military capabilities in place for full-scale invasion,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has now assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine's borders he would need for a full-scale invasion of the country, according to two US officials familiar with the latest estimates. The figure is an estimate based on the latest intelligence assessments, but officials would not specify the intelligence they had or how they developed their assessments, citing the sensitivity of how they collect the information. The assessment represents the continuing significant buildup of Russian forces on Ukraine's borders, but it's unclear how long it would take Putin to ramp up further, or whether the Russian president would need full capabilities in order to invade. The human cost could be dire: Some assessments calculate civilian casualties in Ukraine could run into the tens of thousands with up to five million refugees. US officials publicly and privately still say they do not know if Putin has made a final decision on any type of military action, but behind the scenes, President Joe Biden's national security and intelligence teams are calculating various scenarios and the potential outcomes. In closed-door, classified briefings to Congress as well as in public press conferences, US officials are trying to draw a picture of potentially dire outcomes and the risk Putin poses. There is a strong desire among US officials to explain to the American public why the fate of Ukraine could usher in an era of security and economic destabilization which could ripple across the globe. Russia continues to add forces to the region almost daily, according to US estimates, and could soon have enough to begin an operation. Given all Putin has moved, plus his public rhetoric on Ukraine and NATO, US officials widely believe he could soon make a decision, and it may be more likely than not he will move ahead. Officials stress constantly the intelligence they have is leading them to make these estimates, but they are just estimates. But some are chilling. For example, if Putin were to unleash his full land and air military might on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, the city might fall in 48 hours. They also calculate Putin could decide for a multipronged operation, sending in forces from several directions across Ukraine to quickly fracture the ability of Ukraine's military to fight as a cohesive force; a Russian strategy that is a classic military move. The Pentagon has openly hinted at the status of potential Russian invasion forces. ""Mr. Putin continues to add forces, combined arms, offensive capabilities,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said earlier this week. ""He has shown no signs of being interested or willing to deescalate the tensions."" Putin has not just infantry and missile forces, but hundreds of fighter and bomber aircraft as well as attack helicopters at his disposal. ""There's a potential they could launch on very little warning,"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley warned at a news conference January 28, offering a brutal assessment. ""Given the type of forces that are arrayed ... if that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant, very significant, and it would result in a significant amount of casualties,"" Milley said. ""You can imagine what that might look like in dense urban areas, along roads, and so on and so forth. It would be horrific. It would be terrible.""

2022-02-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/politics/president-authority-deploy-us-troops-explainer/index.html,Here's why presidents send US troops abroad,"President Joe Biden has approved the deployment of 3,000 US troops to Poland, Germany and Romania to bolster NATO countries in Eastern Europe. The deployments, US officials have told CNN, are a show of support to NATO allies feeling threatened by Russia's buildup of troops near Ukraine's border. To be clear, there is no plan for US troops to engage Russian troops, and the White House and the Pentagon have stressed that American service members will not be entering Ukraine. ""They are moves designed to respond to the current security environment,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday, adding that these forces ""are not going to fight in Ukraine."" While the shuffling of troops marks the most significant sign yet that the US is preparing for the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, US troop movement is not unusual at all. And there are a number of options under which a president can deploy troops. Here's what you need to know: Exercises and basing The US can, and does, frequently send troops to Europe to participate in exercises with partner nations. US troops are stationed at bases across the continent, and these exercises and stations are built upon agreements with each nation individually or with a treaty alliance such as NATO. Bilateral agreements or requests These deployments are made in consultation with ally nations and with the agreement of both countries. This is the dynamic playing out now, with the US' NATO allies having asked for US troops to bolster their own defenses and to send a stronger message of deterrence to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But while NATO allies are receiving US troops, the deployment is a US deployment done in consultation with these allies -- not a NATO deployment. NATO As part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US also has commitments to come to the assistance of ally countries and to provide for the overall defense of NATO. Part of that defense entails the NATO Response Force, a multinational, 40,000-strong force. In 2014, partially in response to the Russian invasion of Crimea, NATO created the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which is part of the Readiness Action Plan for quick responses to a changing security environment. NATO has not activated the NATO Response Force -- which has also been used in disaster relief -- in regard to Russia's actions on Ukraine's border, but the Pentagon has said that it has 8,500 troops on heightened readiness in case it does. And the US and NATO have tens of thousands of other troops already in Europe to draw on for any additional deployments to Eastern European allies. Kirby said Wednesday that the troops being deployed were separate from the 8,500 US troops on heightened alert. The Pentagon is ""not ruling out the possibility that there will be more"" US troop movements in the coming days, Kirby said. In 2005, aircraft from the NATO Response Force delivered NATO relief supplies to the US in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and last August, the NATO Response Force was activated to support the evacuation of Afghans who had previously worked alongside NATO. Authorized use of military force This is the most controversial option on the list, but one that has been used repeatedly to send troops to war since the September 11 attacks. As of now, there has been no move to seek congressional authorization to use force in regard to the Russia-Ukraine tensions. The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force comprises only one long sentence. But its 60 broadly written words have helped pave the way for years of military activity. According to official documents, Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump all invoked it during their tenures. While Republicans and Democrats alike have expressed a desire to update the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorized the global war on terror, and the 2002 authorization for the Iraq War, the consensus has been bogged down amid disputes over how a new authorization would deal with the scope of the mission, time constraints and the use of US ground troops. The Constitution, meanwhile, states explicitly that only Congress has the authority to declare war, a power that has been invoked five times in US history: The War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, and World Wars I and II.",4,2.476454735731942,2.703129081030073,-0.22667434529813102,26
2022-02-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/politics/belarus-russian-troops-worries/index.html,Russian troop buildup in Belarus is a 'big worry' to US and European officials,"US and European officials have expressed alarm at Russia's military build-up in Belarus, describing it as a significant and concerning development as the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine looms and calls for Moscow to de-escalate appear to be going unheeded. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said earlier this week that Russia had moved nearly 5,000 troops into Belarus, along with short-range ballistic missiles, special forces, and anti-aircraft batteries, with the intention of massing more than 30,000 troops near that country's border with Ukraine. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that Moscow's deployment into Belarus is the biggest since the Cold War, with ""an expected 30,000 combat troops, Spetsnaz special operation forces, fighter jets including SU-35, Iskander dual-capable missiles and S-400 air defense systems."" One European diplomat called the massing of forces a ""big, big worry,"" noting this would be the missing piece that Moscow would need to launch a quick attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, which is less than two hours from the border of Belarus. On Thursday, a top State Department official spoke with the Belarusian foreign minister ""about the concerning buildup of Russian troops in Belarus,"" and warned that Minsk would face harsh consequences if it allowed its territory to be used to launch an invasion of neighboring Ukraine. According to the US State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Karen Donfried ""reiterated concern about Russia's announced plan to bring 30,000 troops into Belarus for military exercises, particularly with more than 100,000 troops already stationed on Russia's border with Ukraine."" ""Assistant Secretary Donfried also emphasized that Belarus would face commensurate consequences as Russia if it were part of a plan to further invade Ukraine,"" the Department said. Belarusian and Russian officials have said they would conduct joint military exercises this month. Russian Ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Thursday that he didn't ""see any reason for those exercises that had been previously announced and will be conducted according to plan, to be a source of concern to anybody."" Estonian Ambassador to the US Kristjan Prikk told CNN Thursday that he thinks it is ""highly likely"" that Russia could use the exercises as a pretext to leave ""a sizable military contingent"" in Belarus. ""They may rotate this contingent, may not declare it to be permanent, but it is possible that they are going to stay there. And this is something that changes the sort of defense calculus in our region considerably,"" he said. Prikk also noted that Russia's deployment of troops and equipment to Belarus ""serves a dual purpose."" He noted that the southern part of Belarus gives Russia ""a suitable staging ground"" for threatening and potentially attacking Ukraine, noting that Russia ""can even threaten and attack Ukraine without crossing the border from Belarus."" ""With the air defense assets that they have deployed, the S-400 air defense missiles, and with the artillery and missiles...and long range artillery, they can, in fact, threaten Kyiv and some of the key vital infrastructure from Belarus,"" he said. He also noted that the other purpose ""is to signal the West, NATO and to put some military coercion to NATO by having Russian troops in great numbers right across the NATO Eastern border, the areas bordering Latvia, Lithuania and Poland."" Another European diplomat told CNN they find the buildup very concerning, both in terms of what it could mean for Ukraine but as an overall reflection that both the US and Europe ""have underestimated, not to say largely ignored, the strategic and military consequences of the Russian de facto political and military takeover of Belarus, which has been ongoing since 2020 and is now being finalized, with their joint exercise as a highly symbolic crowning event.""",4,2.5018358200767254,2.6981763580110734,-0.19634053793434791,16
2022-02-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/politics/us-alleges-russian-false-flag-ukraine/index.html,US alleges Russia planning false flag operation against Ukraine using 'graphic' video,"US officials alleged Thursday that Russia has been preparing to ""fabricate a pretext for an invasion"" of Ukraine by creating ""a very graphic propaganda video"" that would depict a fake attack by Ukraine against Russia. The US' disclosure of the alleged plot is the latest in a series of revelations designed to blunt the impact of any pretext Russia may use to invade Ukraine, and comes after US officials warned that Moscow could use a false flag operation to justify such an invasion. Russia has continued building up forces and military equipment along Ukraine's borders, despite diplomatic efforts by the US and allies to de-escalate the situation. Speaking at a Pentagon briefing Thursday, press secretary John Kirby said that the US believes the Russian government ""is planning to stage a fake attack by Ukrainian military or intelligence forces against Russian sovereign territory or against Russian-speaking people"" in order to create false rationale for an invasion. ""As part of this fake attack, we believe that Russia would produce a very graphic propaganda video which would include corpses and actors that would be depicting mourners and images of destroyed locations, as well as military equipment at the hands of Ukraine or the West, even to the point where some of this equipment would be made to look like it was Western supplied ... to Ukraine equipment,"" Kirby said. Russian Ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov told CNN Thursday that Moscow is not planning any false flag operations to invade Ukraine. Price, the State Department spokesperson, declined to provide evidence of the US' claim when repeatedly pressed during a press briefing Thursday. He said the information he was sharing about the alleged plans was based on declassified US intelligence, which he said the US shares with the public ""only when we're confident in that information."" ""We are trying to deter the Russians from moving forward with this type of activity. That is why we are making it public today. If the Russians don't go forward with this, that is not ipso facto an indication that they never had plans to do so,"" Price claimed. The Washington Post first reported the story. Also on Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken signed a new defense cooperation agreement between the US and Slovakia at the State Department, a move that is likely to anger Moscow. Blinken made the announcement alongside top Slovak officials, Foreign Minister Ivan Korčok and Defense Minister Jaroslav Naď, who pointed to European security being at stake due to Russian aggressions. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Thursday that the US disclosure about the alleged Russian false flag plans ""is clear and shocking evidence of Russia's unprovoked aggression and underhand activity to destabilise Ukraine."" ""This bellicose intent towards a sovereign, democratic country is completely unacceptable and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,"" she said in a statement. 'I'm not going to spell out what is in our possession' Price would not say if the US had seen an actual video, saying, ""the fact that we are able to go into such great detail, obviously I'm not going to spell out what is in our possession, but I will leave it to you, I will leave that to your judgment."" A source familiar said the US does not have the video nor does it have evidence that it has actually been made. A senior administration official told CNN that the US believes Russia has already recruited actors to be involved in the alleged fake attack. The official said the video could include images of Bayraktar drones, which NATO ally Turkey has provided to Ukraine, ""as a means to implicate NATO in the attack."" This official said the video would ""be released to underscore a threat to Russia's security and to underpin military operations,"" and ""could provide Putin the spark he needs to initiate and justify military operations against Ukraine.""' ""It shows the level of cynicism, frankly, that is on the other side of this conflict,"" deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told MSNBC on Thursday. ""We're not saying definitively this is what they're going to do. We are saying that this is an option under consideration, and that they have used these sorts of pretext in the past to justify military action."" Finer said the US is making the accusation public in order to ""make it much more difficult for [Russia] after the fact to claim that they had to do whatever they decided to do."" Speaking to CNN's Bianca Nobilo Thursday, US Ambassador to NATO Julie Smith said that false flag operations are part of Russia's playbook. ""We saw this in 2014, we've seen other efforts for them to use these types of tactics over the last 10 years,"" Smith said. ""And so what you heard today is just another piece of information where Russia is clearly laying the groundwork to destabilize Ukraine from within and find a pretext to take action using the military forces that it's built up around the border."" Last month, CNN first reported that the US had information indicating Russia had prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to create a pretext for an invasion. The senior administration official also said on Thursday that if Russia decides to change how it views separatist territories in eastern Ukraine—for example, if it decides to view them as independent rather than as part of Ukraine following a legal change by Russia's parliament now under consideration—then Moscow ""could claim that the push for independence led Ukraine to 'attack'"" pro-Russian forces in the east. ""To build the case for independence, Russian politicians are advancing this legislation on the false basis that Ukraine is preparing to forcibly retake this territory and that Kyiv has systematically denied local residents their basic rights,"" the official said. ""In line with its previous interventions, Russia would portray its actions as defending ethnic Russians and coming at the request of a sovereign government for assistance.""

2022-02-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/europe/russia-troops-ukraine-buildup-satellite-images-intl/index.html,New satellite images show buildup of Russian military around Ukraine,"More evidence has emerged of a steady build-up of Russian military equipment and deployments around Ukraine, with new satellite images revealing a further expansion of the military presence at multiple locations in Belarus, Crimea and western Russia. Russian forces have moved into Belarus in the last two weeks. The Russian and Belarus defense ministries say the deployments are ahead of a major training exercise this month. The imagery was collected and analyzed by Maxar. In an accompanying note, Maxar said the deployments ""reflect an increased level of activity and readiness."" Maxar and other satellite imagery providers said they have noticed the expansion of existing Russian military training grounds and garrisons within some 150 miles of the Ukrainian border over the last few months. Some are within a few miles of the border. Maxar said the most recent images show a new phase of Russian activity. It said that previously, ""in most cases, few troops or new housing for additional personnel were observed near the deployments, suggesting that some of the units may have been pre-positioned or forward deployed."" That has begun to change. ""During the past couple of weeks, several new significant military deployments have been observed in Belarus,"" Maxar said. ""Also, troop tents/shelters for personnel have been seen at virtually every deployment location in Belarus, Crimea and western Russia, which suggests that the units are now accompanied with troops and have increased their overall readiness level."" Maxar compared images from September and late January of the same military camp at Novoozerne in Crimea. The images show a significant increase in activity, with an area of tents being erected. That implies the camp is ready to house troops, although there is no evidence of troops arriving as of now. Maxar also note that ""local military training activity (including live-fire artillery and maneuver training) has been observed in progress at numerous training areas."" The imagery shows impact craters at two training areas in Russia: Pogonovo and Persianovsky. Persianovsky is some 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the Ukrainian border. Pogonovo is some 150 miles (220 kilometers) from the border. Konrad Muzyka, a defense analyst focusing on Russia and Belarus at Rochan Consulting, an aerospace and defense consultancy, said he believes there are now between 74 and 76 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) ranged around Ukraine. Battalion tactical groups typically comprise of about 1,000 soldiers, along with support units. Muzyka says that since the first week of January, Russia has been moving its forces from the Eastern Military District -- thousands of miles away in Siberia -- to Western Russia and Belarus. ""The size of this deployment is significant, perhaps as many as 15-20 BTGs,"" Muzyka wrote in a note. He also said that Russian Ground Forces have deployed units that include Iskander short-range ballistic missiles to Belarus and parts of Russia close to Ukraine. He calculates there are at least 48 launchers near Ukraine. While Russian capabilities and movements can often be observed, the Kremlin's intentions are much more difficult to read. US President Joe Biden said last week that an invasion of Ukraine in February is ""a distinct possibility."" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said that ""it is highly likely that [President Putin] is likely to invade Ukraine."" ""There is a real threat of invasion, but we don't know what's going to happen,"" she told the BBC on January 30. The Kremlin has consistently denied that it has any plans to invade Ukraine.",4,2.464072967938681,3.874585007871082,-1.4105120399324012,16
2022-02-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/politics/super-bowl-security-federal-planning/index.html,"Feds prepare 'extensive' Super Bowl security operations, no 'credible, specific' threats, coordinator says","The federal coordinator for security at Super Bowl LVI said Wednesday he's ""cautiously optimistic and comfortable"" about security plans leading up to the game at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, in less than two weeks, noting that ""extensive manpower"" is being deployed to protect the stadium and public. There are currently no known ""credible, specific threats"" to the Super Bowl, Jesse Baker said, but added that ""you don't want to say that we've had a failure of imagination."" ""A perimeter can only go so far, so you're going to have vulnerabilities at some point, but I feel confident that those have been addressed,"" he said, noting potential terrorist threats. The Federal Aviation Administration has designated the Los Angeles area a 'No Drone Zone' for the Super Bowl, prohibiting drones within a 30-nautical-mile radius of the stadium up to 18,000 feet in altitude from 2:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. PST on February 13, 2022. Drone operators who enter the flight restricted area without permission could face drone confiscation, civil penalties that exceed $30,000 and potential criminal prosecution, the agency said. The Super Bowl is designated a ""Special Event Assessment Rating Level 1"", which means the local police department is in charge of security, but a federal security coordinator is appointed to provide support, manage federal assets and work with the local jurisdiction. Baker, the US Secret Service special agent in charge of the Los Angeles Field Office, is serving as the federal coordinator for this year's Super Bowl security efforts. Chief Mark Fronterotta of the Inglewood Police Department is ""ultimately in charge of the security"" for the Super Bowl, Baker said. The security perimeter around the stadium will be shared with the public in the coming days, he added. Asked whether an invasion from Russia into Ukraine would change the security posture for the federal government, Baker said, ""I feel comfortable in our environment for the security"" regardless of any world events, declining to comment further. In addition to the Secret Service, numerous agencies are involved in protecting the Super Bowl, including US Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security Investigations, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, FBI, Department of Defense, as well as other local agencies, such as the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and California Highway Patrol. CBP helicopters and Defense Department fighter jets will be available to help protect the air space, Baker said. Cyber threats have also been examined ahead of the game. There has been an ""extreme amount of training and scenarios,"" Baker said, when asked about potential cyber threats amid Russia-Ukraine tensions. ""It can be a significant thing if it's not considered, but it absolutely has been considered and prepared for in this case by the relevant components,"" he added.",20,4.765699744326543,7.210585645188852,-2.4448859008623085,10
2022-02-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/politics/us-troops-europe-russia/index.html,US troops to deploy to Eastern Europe amid Ukraine crisis,"President Joe Biden has formally approved the deployment of 3,000 US troops to Poland, Germany and Romania, the Pentagon announced Wednesday, in a move to bolster NATO countries in Eastern Europe with tens of thousands of Russian troops amassed along Ukraine's border. The deployments to Eastern Europe, which were first reported by CNN, are a show of support to NATO allies feeling threatened by Russia's military moves near Ukraine and the threat of an invasion, US officials said. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the deployments included roughly 2,000 troops that would deploy from the United States to Poland and Germany. In addition, approximately 1,000 troops currently based in Germany were moving to Romania. Kirby said the moves, which would happen in the coming days, were not permanent and emphasized, ""These forces are not going to fight in Ukraine."" The move is the most significant sign to date that the US is preparing for the prospect of Russian President Vladimir Putin launching an invasion of Ukraine, as Russia has shown no signs of de-escalating after several rounds of diplomatic talks with the US and NATO. Biden signed off on the additional troops following a meeting on Tuesday morning at the White House with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, an official said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN's Matthew Chance in an exclusive statement later Wednesday that the ""US de facto is continuing to pump up tension in Europe."" Peskov said the deployments are ""the best proof that we, as Russia, have an obvious reason to be worried."" Biden told CNN's Kaitlan Collins Wednesday that the decision was ""totally consistent"" with what the US has told Russia throughout discussions. ""It's totally consistent with what I told Putin in the beginning,"" Biden said in a brief exchange in the White House East Room. ""As long as he's acting aggressively, we're going to make sure we reassure our NATO allies and Eastern Europe we're there and Article V is a sacred obligation."" At the same time the US was preparing to send troops to Europe, the White House said Wednesday it was no longer describing a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as ""imminent,"" suggesting the word sent an unintended message. ""I used that once. I think others have used that once. And then we stopped using it because I think it sent a message that we weren't intending to send, which was that we knew President Putin had made a decision,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. Last week, Psaki said an invasion by Russian troops of Ukraine continued to be ""imminent,"" a description that drew anger in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, disagreed, arguing the descriptions could cause panic and economic turmoil. A Ukrainian official told CNN that Kyiv welcomed the reinforcement of NATO's eastern flank, but ""hopes it will be accompanied with continued supplies of defensive weapons to Ukraine, including sophisticated air defenses."" More US troops could be deployed Kirby stressed these additional troop movements don't mean the US believes Putin has decided to invade Ukraine or any other country, but ""if he does invade Ukraine, obviously there's going to be consequences for that."" ""We want to make sure that he knows any move on NATO is going to be resisted, and it's going to trigger Article Five, and we're going to be committed to the defense of our allies,"" Kirby said. Last week, the US placed 8,500 troops in the US on heightened alert in case a NATO Response Force is called up and US forces are needed quickly. But the US and NATO have tens of thousands of other troops already in Europe to draw on for any additional deployments to Eastern European allies. Kirby said that the troops being deployed were separate from the 8,500 US troops on heightened alert. The Pentagon is ""not ruling out the possibility that there will be more"" US troop movements in the coming days, Kirby said. The US deployment to Poland consists of about 1,700 troops from an 82nd Airborne Division infantry brigade combat team based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. There are about 300 service members from the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg deploying to Germany. And the US is moving a stryker squadron of about 1,000 troops from Germany to Romania, Kirby said. The troops will operate on a bilateral basis with their host countries, since NATO has not yet activated the multinational response force. CNN reported last week that the US and a handful of allies had been in discussions to deploy thousands more troops to Eastern European NATO countries before any potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as a show of support in the face of Moscow's ongoing aggression. A Latvian diplomat told CNN Wednesday that Latvia, which borders Russia and Belarus, ""is ready and willing to host more troops from the US -- it's been a long standing topic of discussion with the Pentagon and those discussions are still ongoing."" Allies welcome announcement The announcement of US troop deployments to Poland was welcome news to Polish officials, according to a senior Polish diplomat. Polish officials had been discussing the possibility of sending more US troops to the country with their American counterparts in recent days, the diplomat said. Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau visits Washington beginning Thursday, and he will meet with White House officials and lawmakers, the Polish diplomat said. On Friday, Rau will meet Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department. Biden said last Friday that he would be moving the forces ""in the near term,"" as Russia has continued to build up forces near Ukraine, sparking fears of a renewed invasion even as diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions have continued. New satellite images showed a further expansion of Russia's military presence at multiple locations in Belarus, Crimea and western Russia. On Wednesday, the Spanish newspaper El Pais published confidential written responses that the United States and NATO sent last week to Russia, which rejected Moscow's demand to never admit Ukraine into NATO. El Pais published five pages of what it said was a US government document and four pages of what it said was a NATO document, and said both were sent to Russia on January 26. Kirby confirmed Wednesday the US written response to Russia was authentic, saying that its publication ""confirms to the entire world what we have always been saying."" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the US decision to deploy additional forces to Europe. ""This is a powerful signal of U.S. commitment, and comes on top of other recent U.S. contributions to our shared security -- including 8,500 troops at high readiness for the NATO Response Force, and the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group under NATO command in the Mediterranean,"" Stoltenberg said in a statement.",4,4.906206287582384,3.6571244533988962,1.2490818341834875,7
2022-02-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/politics/white-house-ukraine-messaging/index.html,White House says it's no longer calling potential Russian invasion of Ukraine 'imminent',"The White House says it will no longer describe a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as ""imminent,"" suggesting the word sent an unintended message when officials used it last week. ""I used that once. I think others have used that once. And then we stopped using it because I think it sent a message that we weren't intending to send, which was that we knew (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin had made a decision,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing Wednesday. ""I would say the vast majority of times I've talked about it, we said he could invade at any time,"" she went on. ""That's true. We still don't know that he's made a decision."" The decision to discontinue the use of ""imminent"" came after a rift emerged between US and Ukrainian officials over how best to describe the threat from Russia. While Biden and his senior officials have warned Putin could order troops over the border at any moment, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has downplayed the prospects of imminent war. The discrepancy caused some frustrations to break into the open. Last week, Psaki's description of an attack as ""imminent"" drew anger in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, disagreed, and said the descriptions could cause panic and economic turmoil. ""There is a feeling abroad that there is war here. That's not the case,"" Zelensky said during a news conference last Friday. Biden himself has predicted Putin will ultimately decide to launch an invasion, though has acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the situation and said even Putin's top aides are likely in the dark about the Russian President's intentions. Ukrainian officials said privately it would be more productive for the United States to apply sanctions before a Russian attack than to warn of impending war. ""Kyiv would find more value in taking active deterrent measures such as immediate sanctions against Nord Stream than the persistent verbal warnings predicting imminent war for the last couple months that provide no deterrent, and are actually unintentionally negatively impacting the Ukrainian economy,"" an adviser to Zelensky said, referring to the Russia-Germany gas pipeline Nord Stream 2. On Wednesday, Psaki said she'd only used the word ""imminent"" once, but wouldn't going forward. Other American officials have also avoided the term in recent days. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview Tuesday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine isn't ""imminent"" because the US is still seeking to provide Russia with a diplomatic off-ramp. ""No, I would not say that we are arguing that it's imminent because we're still pursuing a diplomatic solution to give the Russians an off-ramp. Our hope is that this will work and that Putin will understand that war and confrontation is not the path that he wants to follow, but he wants to take a path at diplomacy,"" she told NPR. Still, the shift in language did not suggest new optimism that Russia was preparing to pull back the 100,000 troops it has amassed at Ukraine's border. While Putin said during his own news conference Tuesday he was open to continuing talks, there was little in his remarks to indicate a plan to stand down. Biden, in turn, has deployed 3,000 US troops to Eastern Europe in a bid to reassure NATO allies of the continued American commitment to their security. It wasn't clear when or where US and Russian officials would resume negotiations over each sides' security concerns, even as both Washington and Moscow indicate a preference for a diplomatic solution. Officials said Biden's decision to deploy troops to Europe, made following a lengthy briefing from top Pentagon officials on Tuesday, was not sparked by a particular event over the past days. Instead, they said it was the result of continued consultations with European allies about security needs in the region. And they made explicit the troops would not be sent into Ukraine itself to defend the country from Russian aggression. Yet even sending troops to countries not under current threat from Russia will draw the ire of Putin, who has made known his concerns about NATO and US forces being deployed in former Soviet states. On Wednesday, after the Pentagon announced the new deployments to Poland, Romania and Germany, the White House downplayed the suggestion the move could be viewed as escalating tensions. ""What's important to be very clear about here is there's one aggressor here. That aggressor is Russia,"" Psaki said.",4,3.0885622866003177,3.2356460491528547,-0.14708376255253697,7
2022-02-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/politics/fbi-ukraine-cyber-russia/index.html,US officials prepare for potential Russian cyberattacks as Ukraine standoff continues,"The FBI is asking US businesses to report any uptick in Russian hacking threats -- the latest effort to prepare for potential Russian cyberattacks on US organizations amid Russia's troop buildup on Ukraine's border. ""Have you identified any efforts by known or suspected Russian [hacking groups] to test exploitation capabilities, develop new malware or otherwise prepare for cyber operations?"" the FBI asked in a January 21 request for information to US businesses obtained by CNN. The FBI told US firms to email the bureau if they had found ""any increased [cyber] activity against Ukraine or US critical infrastructure,"" including against financial, health care and energy companies. It's just one of a series of quiet preparations that US officials have made to guard against any potential hacking threats from the Kremlin should the US levy heavy sanctions on Russia for a renewed invasion of Ukraine. There haven't been any reports of specific, significant Russian hacking threats to US infrastructure. But US officials aren't taking that for granted -- given the history of Russian cyber campaigns against US organizations, including an effort a few years ago to breach energy and water firms. At least one previous Russian cyberattack in Ukraine has had global ramifications. A 2017 cyberattack that the Justice Department blamed on Russian military intelligence began by infecting a Ukrainian software provider, but spread around the world, causing billions of dollars of damage. Now, US officials are watching closely in case any US response to Russia's military build-up portends an increase in the digital threats facing US organizations. ""We have the weather forecast [of potential Russian cyber threats],"" a US official told CNN. ""Now we're trying to see if there will be any inclement weather in the form of actual cyber incidents."" In addition, top White House cyber official Anne Neuberger is in Europe this week to talk with US allies about how to support Ukraine in the event of Russian cyberattacks. Russia knows that ""disabling or destroying critical infrastructure"" through cyberattacks can pressure another country into ""ceding to Russian objectives,"" Neuberger told reporters Wednesday. ""We've been working closely with Ukrainians to harden their defenses and will continue to do so in the days ahead."" Lessons from past Russian hacking White House and federal agencies charged with cybersecurity have been on heightened alert, with officials checking in with critical infrastructure firms regularly. The departments of Energy and Treasury, and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, have in recent weeks held a series of briefings for industry executives on Russian hacking capabilities. While US officials say they are unaware of any credible and specific Russian hacking threats to the US homeland, they have told US businesses and state and local governments how that could change. Russia would consider conducting a cyberattack on the US homeland if Moscow perceived that a US or NATO response to a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine ""threatened [Russia's] long-term national security,"" the Department of Homeland Security said in a January 23 intelligence bulletin first reported by CNN. DHS analysts, however, assessed that Moscow's threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive cyberattacks on the US homeland ""probably remains very high."" The government is, to some degree, reliant on private companies to report emerging hacking threats because those companies own and operate the majority of US critical infrastructure. The concern among US officials has long been that Russian hackers could gain a foothold into industrial networks that, for example, help distribute electricity or provide other critical services. In 2018, DHS accused Russian government-backed hackers of engaging in a multi-year effort to infiltrate US energy, water and manufacturing firms. In some case, the hackers took screenshots of sensitive industrial computer systems that help operate machinery. US critical infrastructure operators have in recent years grown more aware of the threat and invested more in cyber defenses as Russian hacking groups have stayed active around the world. Rob Joyce, who heads the National Security Agency's Cybersecurity Directorate, said in September that US officials had previously ""seen evidence of [Russian] prepositioning against US critical infrastructure."" The FBI and other agencies want to know if anything new on that front is happening right now. The questionnaire the bureau sent US businesses last month asked if they were aware of any industrial control systems that had been recently compromised by Russian hackers. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the request for information. The intelligence sharing has gone both ways. Robert M. Lee, CEO of Maryland-based cybersecurity firm Dragos, told officials at the National Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in January that a foreign hacking group had probed the computer networks of US electric utilities that operate liquefied natural gas facilities, Lee told CNN. The activity, detected in December, involved ""high-level reconnaissance,"" and did not lead to any compromises, Lee said. The hacking group -- known in the cybersecurity industry as Xenotime or Temp.Veles -- developed tools used in an incident that forced a Saudi petrochemical plant to shut down in 2017, according to cybersecurity researchers. The Treasury Department in 2020 sanctioned a Russian government institute for its alleged involvement in that incident. ""Right now, the biggest concern we have are preparations for potential impacts to US utilities and industrial critical infrastructure,"" Sergio Caltagirone, Dragos' vice president of threat intelligence, told CNN. An NSA spokesperson said the agency's Cybersecurity Collaboration Center uses it expertise to ""proactively engage the defense industrial base and its service providers to disrupt ongoing nation-state threats in real-time."" What happens in Ukraine may not stay there The US effort to anticipate Russian hacking threats draws on information on the ground in Ukraine, which has had to fend off a string of cyberattacks since mid-January. One component of the hacks involved destructive malicious code that wiped data from at least two Ukrainian government agencies. The incident has been contained and not widely disruptive, but it had echoes of the 2017 cyberattack in its use of destructive computer code that was disguised as ransomware. US companies that do business in Ukraine should be wary of spillover from cyberattacks on Ukrainian networks, government and industry executives have warned. ""[D]isruptive and destructive attacks against Ukraine are likely to have broader implications, including potential impacts to organizations based outside the country,"" US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said in an intelligence assessment. Health care organizations with a presence in Ukraine -- or that work with suppliers there -- are isolating computer networks serving that part of the business to guard against potential hacking threats, according to Errol Weiss, chief security officer of the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a global cyber threat sharing group for health care providers.",20,8.023336550719744,7.095932184664879,0.9274043660548648,2
2022-02-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/europe/vladimir-putin-west-ignored-russia-concerns-intl/index.html,Vladimir Putin says the West has 'ignored' Russia's key concerns over Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that his government was studying the responses from the United States and NATO to his security demands related to Ukraine but that it was clear the Kremlin's main complaints ""had been ignored."" For weeks, Putin had said little publicly about the crisis sparked by Russia's buildup of tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders, which has raised fears of a possible invasion. But speaking at a Tuesday news conference following a five-hour meeting in Moscow with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Putin said: ""It is already clear -- I informed the Prime Minister about this -- that the fundamental Russian concerns were ignored. We did not see an adequate consideration of our three key requirements."" Putin added that Russia had not seen ""adequate consideration of our three key demands regarding NATO expansion, the renunciation of the deployment of strike weapons systems near Russian borders, and the return of the [NATO] bloc's military infrastructure in Europe to the state of 1997, when the Russia-NATO founding act was signed."" Putin also accused the US directly of attempting to ""draw us into armed conflict"" over the Ukraine crisis by using the country as a ""tool"" for NATO operations. He claimed that Washington's main goal is to force ""allies in Europe to impose the very tough sanctions against us,"" or ""draw Ukraine into NATO."" The US and NATO have said Putin's demands -- which include a promise to never expand eastward to countries including Ukraine -- violate NATO's open-door policy and are non-starters in negotiations. Putin did not offer any solutions on Tuesday, but did say he was open to more talks. ""I hope that this dialogue will continue,"" he said, adding: ""I hope that we will eventually find this solution, although it is not an easy one, and we are aware of this. But what that will be, I'm not ready to say today, of course."" Putin ended the news conference with a short lecture about what he characterized as NATO's history of deceptions, claiming that the alliance promised to expand ""not an inch"" eastward. ""They said one thing, they did another,"" Putin said. ""As people say, they screwed us over, well they simply deceived us."" Russian officials have repeatedly made this claim in the past; the US and NATO have denied making such promises. Putin also reiterated his opposition to the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO, and said Kyiv was attempting to retake Crimea -- the Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014 -- by military force, potentially bringing the alliance into open conflict with Russia. ""This [Crimea] is sovereign Russian territory, the question is closed for us,"" he said. ""Let's imagine that Ukraine is a NATO country and starts these military operations. Then what, we should fight against the NATO bloc? So, has anyone thought about this? Looks like no."" Diplomats from the US, Russia, Ukraine, NATO and the European Union have been engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held a phone call Tuesday. Following that call, a senior State Department official said Lavrov did not give an indication that Moscow will de-escalate from the border with Ukraine. Blinken told Lavrov that if Putin ""does not intend war or regime change,"" then it was time to pull back troops and heavy weaponry and engage in serious, diplomatic discussions, the official said. Lavrov responded that the escalation that the US was claiming was not occurring, the official said, but that it was merely Russia moving troops within its own borders. US State Department officials confirmed Monday they had ""received a written followup from Russia"" to a document of proposals the US sent to the Kremlin last week on how to defuse tensions and pave the way for further security talks in response to Russia's demands on security. On Tuesday, however, the Kremlin said that Russia had not yet sent its ""main reply"" to the US. ""There was a mix-up,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call. ""It [the Russian correspondence] regarded a different matter. The main reply on this issue hasn't been handed over, it's still being prepared."" Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a press conference alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Tuesday. Johnson accused Russia of ""holding a gun to Ukraine"" and warned that a potential invasion of Ukraine by Russia would be a ""political"" and ""humanitarian disaster."" ""The potential invasion completely flies in the face of President Putin's claims to be acting in the interests of the Ukrainian people,"" Johnson said. Zelensky said that should a war between Russia and Ukraine start it will be a ""big war in Europe,"" adding that there ""will be no occupation of any territory or city in Ukraine... but there will be a bloody tragedy if the invasion of our country starts.""",4,4.520629966961414,1.0042037790953917,3.516426187866022,17

The developments come as US officials warn that Russia could mount a major invasion of Ukraine, including from neighboring Belarus. At a UN Security Council meeting Monday, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the US had seen evidence that Moscow intends to mass more than 30,000 troops at the Belarus-Ukraine border by early February and that 5,000 troops were already there. In an updated travel advisory issued Monday, the State Department said that ""due to an increase in unusual and concerning Russian military activity near the border with Ukraine, U.S. citizens located in or considering travel to Belarus should be aware that the situation is unpredictable and there is heightened tension in the region."" ""Given the heightened volatility of the situation, U.S. citizens are strongly advised against traveling to Belarus,"" the advisory said, adding that ""the U.S. government's ability to provide routine or emergency services to U.S. citizens in Belarus is already severely limited due to Belarusian government limitations on U.S. Embassy staffing."" Last week, in a move criticized by the Ukrainian government, the State Department authorized the departure of US government employees from the US Embassy in Kyiv and ordered the departure of family members there ""due to the continued threat of Russian military action."" The US has a limited diplomatic presence in Belarus due to restrictions imposed by the government of strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko. Last August, the Belarusian government told the US Embassy in Minsk to reduce the number of staff to five, and in October it forced the embassy to close its Public Diplomacy and US Agency for International Development offices and lay off more than 20 Belarusian staff effective November 20. The US ambassador to Belarus, Julie Fisher, has been forced to serve in neighboring Lithuania. On Monday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the US has ""been very clear, including to Belarusian authorities directly, that if it allows its territory to be used for an attack on Ukraine, it would face a swift and decisive response from the United States and our allies and partners."" ""We've spoken of the unprecedented nature of sanctions and other economic measures that would befall the Russian Federation in the event of an invasion. Were Belarus -- what should be a sovereign, independent country -- if that country were to support such an invasion, our response would also be swift and decisive,"" he said at a State Department briefing. At Monday's UN Security Council meeting over Russia's escalation toward Ukraine, the Belarusian ambassador to the UN said his country was in support of dialogue but reiterated that it would act in defense of its ally Russia if it were attacked. He also said that Russia and Belarus would be holding joint military activities, which he said ""are always purely defensive in nature, and they pose no threat either for our European partners, or our neighboring countries.""",4,4.1061085077153505,3.46683723822337,0.6392712694919807,10

""It [the Russian correspondence] regarded a different matter. The main reply on this issue hasn't been handed over, it's still being prepared."" The world might yet get a rare glimpse of Vladimir Putin's thinking on the tensions later on Tuesday. The Russian President is expected to make an appearance in front of the press in Moscow after meeting the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Diplomats from the US, Russia, Ukraine, NATO and the European Union have been engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks. On Tuesday, there is also a planned phone call between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will meet Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Putin himself has so far remained tight-lipped, making scant public remarks about the crisis, but the news conference following the meeting with Orban may offer some insight. Hungary is a member of both NATO and the European Union, but Orban has cultivated a close relationship with the Russian President. In the past, the Hungarian government has sometimes sided with Russia over Ukraine. In 2019, Budapest vetoed a joint declaration of NATO ambassadors on Ukraine, effectively blocking Ukraine's attempts at a closer cooperation with the alliance. However, as tension have risen in recent weeks, Hungary, which shares a border with Ukraine, said it was in discussions with the US about the possibility of accepting around 1,000 US and allied troops into Hungary. Meanwhile, Blinken is expected to speak with Lavrov on Tuesday, according to a State Department spokesperson. This call comes on the heels of a heated exchange between the US and Russian ambassadors to the United Nations during a Security Council meeting Monday, with the US saying Russia didn't give the answers they hoped for and Russia accusing Western UN colleagues of ""whipping up tensions and rhetoric."" Build-up of troops continues While the US and its allies continue to pressure Russia to de-escalate the situation, floating the idea of new sanctions and boosting their presence in Eastern Europe, the Pentagon said Russia has continued the buildup of forces around its border with Ukraine. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Monday that additional Russian troops moved ""in again around Belarus and around the border with Ukraine"" over the weekend, adding that Russia was also increasing its ""naval activity in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic."" ""They have put to sea more ships, they are exercising at sea, they are clearly increasing the capabilities they have at sea, should they need it,"" Kirby said. Both the added ground troops in Belarus and near the Ukrainian border as well as the Russian fleet vessels at sea are creating ""options available to Mr. Putin,"" Kirby said. Wider diplomatic efforts will also continue on Tuesday with a series of meetings involving Ukraine officials. UK Prime Minister Johnson was traveling to Kyiv Tuesday for talks with President Zelensky. In the runup to the meeting, Johnson announced £88 million ($118 million) in new funding for Ukraine aimed at helping the country achieve ""stable governance and energy independence,"" according to a statement from Downing Street. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was also scheduled to visit Ukraine on Tuesday. In a statement posted on his official Twitter account on Monday, Rutte said he spoke with the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and would speak to the French President Emmanuel Macron before his trip on Tuesday. Macron himself spoke to Zelensky and to Putin on Friday, and then again to the Russian President on Monday. A readout of the call from the Elysee Palace said Putin and Macron wished ""to continue the dialogue"" in the Normandy Format, a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France that has been trying to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014.",4,0.76235106428138,0.980626086497606,-0.21827502221622597,17

The official said the phone conversation between the two top diplomats lasted about 30 minutes and they described the tone as ""professional and fairly candid."" The call between Blinken and Lavrov came one day after a tense UN Security Council meeting where the US and Russia traded accusations over Moscow's escalations on the Ukrainian border, where Russia has massed thousands of troops. Blinken told Lavrov that if Russian President Vladimir Putin ""does not intend war or regime change,"" then it was time to pull back troops and heavy weaponry and engage in serious, diplomatic discussions, the official said. Lavrov responded that the escalation that the US was claiming was not occurring, the official said, but that it was merely Russia moving troops within its own borders. Blinken raised Russia's troops buildup in Belarus -- which US officials said could reach 30,000 by early February -- but there was not an ""extensive"" exchange on it, according to the official. Blinken reiterated the US commitment to pursuing diplomacy, officials and State Department spokesman Ned Price said, and the two top diplomats agreed they should speak again after the US receives a formal written reply from Moscow, which Putin would review. In Moscow Tuesday alongside Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Putin made his first public comments in weeks, saying that the written responses from the West had ""ignored"" Russia's main security concerns. Russia has demanded that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine and that NATO countries pull back troops and military equipment from Eastern European countries admitted to NATO since 1997, including Romania and Bulgaria. The US and NATO have said these demands violate NATO's open-door policy and are non-starters in negotiations with Moscow. 'Serious differences' According to Price's written readout of the call, Blinken ""further reiterated the US commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of all countries to determine their own foreign policy and alliances."" At a press briefing Tuesday afternoon, Price did not respond to any specific remarks made by Putin, while saying that the US remains focused on the formal response from the Kremlin that will be coming in a matter of days or weeks. ""We heard from President Putin a variety of things. I will leave it to the Kremlinologists out there, budding, professional, amateur or otherwise, to read the tea leaves and try to interpret the significance of those remarks,"" Price said. ""For our part, we don't necessarily need to do that because we know that a formal response from the Russian Federation is forthcoming. We heard that again today from Foreign Minister Lavrov."" Once the US receives the written response from Russia, they will chart the diplomatic path forward,"" Price said. The US did receive a written response from Russia on Monday, but the Kremlin said Tuesday that it was not its ""main reply"" to the US over Russia's security concerns, saying there had been a ""mix-up."" Russia's foreign ministry released the text the letter Tuesday, which it said was given to the United States, Canada and several European countries. In the letter, Lavrov wrote that the US and NATO responses to Russia's proposals ""demonstrate serious differences in the understanding of the principle of equal and indivisible security that is fundamental to the entire European security architecture."" A second senior official said that the ""continued engagement on the Russian side is evidence"" that Russia has not fully shut the door on diplomacy. ""I do think they agree that ideas in those in that non paper could be the basis for a constructive conversation about how you enhance security in Europe,"" they said. Several European diplomats told CNN they will be watching closely to see what happens on the diplomatic track in the coming weeks. Blinken spoke with top officials at NATO, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) following his call with Lavrov, and they ""agreed to continue to coordinate closely and committed to seek a diplomatic solution to prevent further aggression against Ukraine,"" according to a State Department readout. 'Holding a gun' British Prime Minister Boris Johnson traveled to Ukraine Tuesday, where he met in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. At a news conference, Johnson portrayed Russia's escalation as a threat not just to Ukraine but to all of NATO and Europe. ""Vladimir Putin is trying, by holding a gun, intimidating Ukraine, to get us to change the way we look at something that was fantastic,"" Johnson said of NATO. ""What is happening now is President Putin is trying to undermine those gains and re-draw the security map of Europe and new zones of influence. It wouldn't be just Ukraine, it would be Georgia, Moldova -- this moment is critical."" There have been some differences within NATO over how to respond in the event of Russian action in Ukraine -- which President Joe Biden alluded to at his news conference last week. Biden and Zelensky also clashed in a phone call last week over US rhetoric saying an invasion was ""imminent."" However, US officials and European diplomats have said there is broad consensus about the threat and the need to be prepared to respond in a significant way if Russia invades. One European diplomat said they ""would not use the word rift"" to describe the differences on possible sanctions between the US and its European allies. ""There are clearly differences and there are clearly national interests being looked after, all of which is was entirely predictable,"" they said. The diplomat noted that it makes sense to deliberately keep quite a bit of ambiguity in public communication about what the consequences could be, but it's a difficult balance to strike because if one is too general, then the of the threat might appear less credible to the Russian leadership. ""I think I think it wouldn't hurt to be a little bit more specific for sure,"" the diplomat said.

""Let them console themselves with saying that it is 'defensive.' It does not make things easier for us,"" Lavrov told Russia's Channel One evening show on Sunday. ""The line of defense has already come close to us."" ""It turns out each time that the line they are supposed to defend is moving further east. Now, it has already come close to Ukraine,"" Russia's top diplomat added. His comments came amid heightened tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Sunday it is ""highly likely"" that Russia ""will invade Ukraine."" ""As we saw in Chechnya, as we saw in Afghanistan, the Ukrainians will fight -- that is absolutely clear,"" she told the BBC. Lavrov said an eventual accession of Ukraine to NATO would ""really undermine relations with the Russian Federation."" ""It will be a gross violation of obligations taken by the presidents of the US and other member states of the alliance,"" the Russian Foreign Minister said. Lavrov said his office would be sending requests for clarification to his counterparts in NATO and the OSCE. ""[We are sending] a pressing request to explain how they intend to fulfil the commitment not to strengthen their security at the expense of security of the others,"" he said. ""If they don't plan this, then they should explain why. This will be the key question in determining our further proposals that we will report to Russian President Vladimir Putin."" Lavrov also claimed Ukraine's accession to the North Atlantic alliance made little sense, from a strategic standpoint. ""It is clear to everyone that Ukraine is not ready and it won't make any contribution whatsoever to the strengthening of NATO's security,"" he said. Earlier on Sunday, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC the group has no plans to deploy combat troops to Ukraine as the country is not part of the alliance. ""We have no plans to deploy NATO combat troops to Ukraine...Ukraine is not a NATO ally, so the 100% security guarantees that the attack on one ally will trigger a response from the whole alliance, applies to NATO allies not to a close and valuable partner,"" Stoltenberg said.",4,1.4415186276894336,2.4428489888707574,-1.0013303611813238,26

On the package, Menendez, who chairs the committee, said some sanctions could happen upfront and others would go into effect if Russia were to invade Ukraine. ""I would describe it as that we are on the one-yard line and hopefully we will be able to conclude successfully,"" said Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey. ""Look, there are some sanctions that really could take place upfront because of what Russia has already done. Cyberattacks on Ukraine, false flag operations, the efforts to undermine the Ukrainian government internally, those are just some examples of sanctions that could take place now."" He added: ""But then the devastating sanctions that ultimately would crush Russia's economy and the continuing lethal aid that we are going to send, which means Putin has to decide how many body bags of Russian sons are going to return to Russia, the sanctions that we're talking about would come later on if (Russia) invades. Some sanctions would come up front for what has been done already, but the lethal aid will travel no matter what."" Risch, a Republican from Idaho, said a major sticking point in negotiations for the economic sanctions package continues to be the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. ""We've had a disagreement on that, continuing disagreement, since the administration took office,"" Risch said. ""But look, there's been something happened on the ground that is changed the dynamics and open the door, really, for us to reach agreement on that and that is that the Germans have signaled that they are suspending, pausing if you would, certification, thus completion of the pipeline for six months.""

Reuters was first to report Russia's movement of blood supplies to the border with Ukraine, which would be necessary to treat casualties in the event of a conflict. The development has added to US concerns that Russia has the capabilities in place to launch an attack on very short notice. One of the officials who spoke with CNN cautioned that the presence of Russian blood supplies near the Ukrainian border is not an absolute indicator of an invasion. Instead, it is one element among many the US is monitoring as the build-up of Russian forces steadily proceeds. CNN reported last month that Russia had begun erecting supply lines such as medical units and fuel that could sustain a drawn-out conflict should Moscow choose to invade. Ukraine has denied that Russia has moved any blood supplies to the front lines. On Saturday, Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar called the reports ""not true."" ""This information is not true,"" she said in a statement on Facebook. ""Such 'news' is an element of information and psychological warfare.

""But at the same time he's downplaying the risk of invasion, he's asking for hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to defend against one. We think it's important to be open and candid about that threat."" CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense. CNN reported on Friday that tension has been building between Zelensky and Biden administration officials, amid a disagreement over how to interpret and publicly communicate US intelligence assessments that say Russia could be preparing a large-scale attack on Ukraine.

2022-01-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/europe/ukraine-russia-explainer-war-threat-cmd-intl/index.html,Ukraine-Russia crisis: How soon might a war be and what would it look like?,"The Ukraine crisis is the classic case of a known unknown: We know that we don't know what Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to do as he amasses troops on the Ukrainian border. So how imminent is the threat of a full-scale war? Some fears appear to have receded slightly following key talks that included Russian and Ukrainian officials. But the Pentagon also says the Russian troop buildup continues, and President Joe Biden told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on a call Thursday that there was a distinct possibility Russia could launch an invasion in February, according to National Security Council Spokesperson Emily Horne. Zelensky, however, restated his position that the threat from Russia remains ""dangerous but ambiguous,"" and it is not certain that an attack will take place, a senior Ukrainian official told CNN. Diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis continue. Taking that into account, here's a look at how soon an invasion could happen and what it might look like. How imminent is the threat of war really? Analysts say Russia has a menu of options to attack at any moment it chooses, from shock-and-awe style air strikes to a ground invasion along a broad front. But while it has moved large amounts of military equipment into place in areas bordering Ukraine, not all the personnel needed for a ground operation are ready. ""At the moment, Russia has a lot of equipment pre-positioned along with its own border with Ukraine,"" said Janes, a global agency for open-source defense intelligence. ""(This) reduces the amount of time it requires for them to fill that area with more forces if they decide to fight because all of their heavy equipment's there."" Troops can be deployed in less than 72 hours, the agency said, since they need only be sent from their bases by plane or train across the country. Russia is also in the process of deploying ""quite a sizable formation"" in Belarus from its Eastern Military District (EMD), which extends from Russia's Pacific Coast to Siberia, Janes said. This formation, which Janes first detected moving west early this month, appears to include troops, logistics and communications resources as well as military equipment. Russia has said the force is there for a Russian-Belarusian training exercise. But according to Janes, the troops ""are essentially deploying as close to ready to go as you can be."" Judging by what has been pre-positioned on Russian soil near Ukraine's border, it considers Russia would require ""maybe a maximum of two weeks of intense movement to bring all of the pieces into position"" if it were to launch an invasion. Whether Russia would want to put large numbers of boots on the ground remains unclear, particularly given the risk of casualties. ""The important thing to realize is that (Russia) is quite wary of what it calls contact warfare,"" that is, forces fighting each on the ground, said Sam Cranny-Evans, a research analyst with the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). ""We've seen (this) in Chechnya, in Afghanistan, in Georgia and its covert deployments to Ukraine, that military losses actually do generate political pressure."" Russia could instead opt to use its very long-range intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets to target critical national infrastructure within Ukraine, such as military bases or even power plants and bridges, Cranny-Evans said. ""The goal is to either stop a contact conflict from emerging or shape the battlefield so that when one does emerge, it's much more favorable to the Russian forces,"" he said. US intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine ""as soon as early 2022."" Since then, US officials have stuck to that line. However, Ukrainian officials say the latest military intelligence suggests Russian forces are not yet prepared to stage a full-blown invasion into the country. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, a source close to the Ukrainian leadership said defense and intelligence chiefs were analyzing satellite images of Russian forces ""from US and other western agencies"" on an hourly basis, but were not yet seeing Russia ""getting into combat mode, or positioning themselves to attack."" Ukrainian intelligence assesses that the threat from Russia is ""dangerous, but not imminent,"" the source told CNN, and that if any Russian order to attack were given it would still take one to two weeks for Russian forces near the border to be ready. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba struck a similar note Wednesday, saying Russian troops could attack Ukraine at any time, as had been the case since 2014, but that its forces were not yet fully assembled. ""We can say 100 times a day invasion is imminent, but this doesn't change the situation on the ground,"" he said. ""In terms of timelines, what we've seen up until now has been very overt signaling of the intention for the ability to invade Ukraine,"" said Cranny-Evans. But the Russians are ""taking their time"" to get the final pieces into place in order to leave space for conversations which might allow them to achieve their political goals, such as installing a pro-Kremlin or even neutral leader in Kiev, without having to fight, he suggested. If it does come to an invasion, he considers that Russia could move the necessary troops into place in the space of 72 hours. ""It's the forces that Russia already has in the Southern Military District on the borders with Ukraine that would probably take on the first bit of fighting,"" Cranny-Evans said. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that it is NATO's support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- that constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. What else could influence the timeline for a potential invasion? There may also be non-geopolitical factors to take into account, such as the weather and the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing. If Putin orders his forces to invade, some analysts have speculated it would come before the spring thaw. ""The best time to do it is winter because it's going to be a mechanized advance and the mechanized divisions need hard frozen ground,"" journalist and author Tim Marshall told CNN. However, Cranny-Evans does not believe the weather would play a major role in any decision to invade. ""Russia has quite a long history of just fighting when it suits Russia. There's no real indication that it's bothered by mud,"" he said, adding that Russian forces are experienced in operating on this terrain. ""Armored fighting vehicles, particularly tracked ones, have generally very good mobility even on very soft soil, and it would have to be extremely degraded before they couldn't move on it at all."" Ukraine has a pretty good road system, he added. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman suggested this week that the Winter Olympics beginning next week in China could influence Russia's thinking. Putin plans to be there when the Games kick off and Chinese President Xi Jinping ""would not be ecstatic if Putin chose that moment to invade Ukraine,"" Sherman said. Sherman added that she suspects that ""even the people around"" Putin don't know what he will do with regards to Ukraine, but that the US sees ""every indication that he is going to use military force, sometime perhaps now and (up to the) middle of February."" A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman noted on January 14 that United Nations members had adopted an Olympic Truce resolution which urges countries to ""cease hostilities from seven days before the start of the Olympic Games until seven days after the end of the Paralympic Games."" That period would extend from January 28 to March 20. What would an invasion look like? It's hard to predict -- but recent history may give some clues. Russia has, after all, already invaded Ukrainian soil twice in the past decade. When Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 it did so on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian speakers. First, thousands of special-operations troops, dubbed ""little green men"" and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the southern peninsula. Then, within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate. Shortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known as the Donbas, declared their independence from Kiev, prompting months of heavy fighting. Russia's de facto invasion of the Donbas region ended in 2015, when a ceasefire was signed, but Russia still props up the separatist movement there. CNN global affairs analyst Michael Bociurkiw, a former spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said this week he believed Putin might choose to invade through the Donbas because he ""knows he will get away with it."" The area -- heavily damaged in places by shelling -- is wrongly regarded by some in the West as ""a territory that is dispensable,"" Bociurkiw said. ""Putin has been giving out hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to pro-Russian residents of the Donbas -- now he has an even further pretext to go in and say they need to be protected,"" he said. At its most minor, Russian action could involve ""normalizing"" the country's grip on the Donbas region by sending in Russian troops to lock down their control of the area, or even to slightly widen its buffer zone against the rest of Ukraine, said CNN's International Security Editor Nick Paton Walsh. Other analysts suggest that a narrow land corridor along the Azov Sea, through the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, could be easily achieved through an amphibious landing on the Azov Sea coast, said Paton Walsh -- although such a corridor would be hard to defend. Another option that's been mooted is a wider invasion of the country, Paton Walsh added, but this would be costly for Russia in terms of Russian lives and Western sanctions. Kuleba said Wednesday that his country was focused on ""every scenario,"" not just the threat of military invasion. ""We see a scenario of destabilization of Ukraine and that scenario is imminent, it's already taking place -- by spreading panic, by putting pressure on Ukraine's financial system, by conducting cyber attacks against Ukraine,"" the minister said. What forces does Russia have in place? According to a Ukrainian Defense Ministry intelligence assessment shared with CNN last week, Russia had more than 106,000 ground personnel near Ukraine's borders, with another 21,000 or so air and naval personnel on hand. The assessment also said Russia supports more than 35,000 rebels in eastern Ukraine and has about 3,000 of its own military personnel based in rebel territory. Moscow denies having any forces in eastern Ukraine.

2022-01-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/politics/biden-zelensky-call/index.html,Ukrainian official tells CNN Biden's call with Ukrainian President 'did not go well' but White House disputes account,"A call between US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday ""did not go well,"" a senior Ukrainian official told CNN, amid disagreements over the ""risk levels"" of a Russian attack. The White House, however, disputed the official's account, warning that anonymous sources were ""leaking falsehoods."" They did state that Biden warned Zelensky an imminent invasion is a ""distinct possibility."" On the call, which the Ukrainian official described as ""long and frank,"" Biden warned his Ukrainian counterpart that a Russian attack may be imminent, saying that an invasion was now virtually certain, once the ground had frozen later in February, according to the official. Zelensky, however, restated his position that the threat from Russia remains ""dangerous but ambiguous,"" and it is not certain that an attack will take place, the official said. National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne disputed the senior Ukrainian official's description of the call. ""Anonymous sources are 'leaking' falsehoods,"" she told CNN. ""President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February. He has said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false."" The frank discussion between the two leaders comes as the US and NATO continue to brace for the prospect of a Russian invasion. Though they have stressed the need for diplomacy, the White House has warned an invasion could be imminent with tens of thousands of Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border. The call lasted an hour and 20 minutes Thursday, according to a US national security official, highlighting the extensive issues the two leaders had to discuss amid the Russian troop buildup. The official described the call as ""long and serious,"" but ""productive,"" as Biden and Zelensky discussed Russia's recent aggressions. Biden told Zelensky that US officials have assessed an invasion could potentially happen in February, but did not say it definitely would, the official said. White House says Biden promised US would 'respond decisively' if Russia invades A White House readout of the call said that Biden ""reaffirmed"" to Zelensky that the United States would ""respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine."" Biden also said the US will explore ""additional macroeconomic support"" to help the Ukrainian economy as a result of Russia's military buildup. ""President Biden noted the United States has provided Ukraine with over half a billion dollars in development and humanitarian assistance in the last year, and is exploring additional macroeconomic support to help Ukraine's economy amidst pressure resulting from Russia's military build-up,"" the White House said in the readout. A spokesman for Zelensky also disputed the Ukrainian official's characterization of the call. Zelensky tweeted that he and Biden had a long call where they ""discussed recent diplomatic efforts on de-escalation and agreed on joint actions for the future."" The Ukrainian President said he thanked Biden for the ongoing military assistance and said ""possibilities for financial support to Ukraine were also discussed."" The senior Ukrainian official, however, told CNN that Biden said Ukraine would not be offered significantly more military help. Zelensky urged his American counterpart to ""calm down the messaging,"" warning of the economic impact of panic, according to the official. He also said Ukrainian intelligence sees the threat differently. The Ukrainian leader pointed to a recent breakthrough in negotiations with Russia in Paris, saying that he hoped a ceasefire agreement with rebels in eastern Ukraine would be maintained. He also said the talks between the US, Russia and NATO still had some distance to run before diplomatic efforts had been exhausted, the official said. Earlier in the day, another source from the US side said there is a recognition in the White House that Zelensky has ""multiple audiences"" and is trying to balance them. ""On the one hand, he wants assistance, but he has to assure his people he has the situation under control. That's a tricky balance,"" the source said. Pentagon says Russian buildup is continuing Russia's military buildup along the Ukrainian border has increased over the past 24 hours, the Pentagon said Thursday, while the US awaits Russian President Vladimir Putin's response to its written proposals submitted to Moscow on Wednesday. ""We continue to see, including in the last 24 hours, more accumulation of credible combat forces arrayed by the Russians in, again, the western part of their country and in Belarus,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said at a press briefing. Kirby described the buildup as ""not dramatic"" but ""also not sclerotic."" The US is still holding out hope that diplomatic efforts with Russia can lead to a de-escalation. On Wednesday, the US and NATO submitted separate written responses to Russia's publicly aired concerns, an overture that Moscow had requested. While the US did not disclose what was contained in the document, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Wednesday it did not give any ground NATO's ""open-door policy,"" leaving the US at odds with Russia's central demand that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine. Putin has read the responses from the US and NATO, a Kremlin spokesman said Thursday, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said they failed to address Russia's primary concerns. ""There is no positive reaction on the main issue in this document,"" Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. ""The main issue is our clear position on the inadmissibility of further expansion of NATO to the East and the deployment of strike weapons that could threaten the territory of the Russian Federation."" Blinken said Thursday he had ""heard a variety of initial responses from different people in Russia to the paper that we shared with them, as well as to the paper that NATO shared with them."" ""But the response that counts is President Putin's response, and to the best of our understanding, according the Russians, these papers are on his desk,"" he said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. ""And we'll look forward to his response, which I'm sure will be conveyed through Foreign Minister Lavrov and others in the days ahead. That's what matters most,"" he said. On Thursday evening, US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield called for a UN Security Council meeting on the crisis to take place on Monday. US officials have continued to emphasize they were prepared to act regardless of whether Russia pursues diplomacy or further aggression toward Ukraine, and on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that ""nothing is off the table"" when it comes to sanctions should Moscow invade -- including killing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany and removing Russia from SWIFT international payment system. ""The commission is responsible for designing, shaping and developing the sanctions,"" von der Leyen told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""We are very clear that if there is any further aggression or military aggression of Russia against Ukraine, there will be massive consequences, and severe costs for Russia."" Pentagon details troops on heightened alert Earlier this week, as many as 8,500 US troops were placed on heightened alert to prepare to deploy to Eastern Europe. Those troops include elements of the 82nd airborne division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, as well as elements of the 18th Airborne Corps, the 101st Airborne Division and the Fourth Infantry Division, Kirby said Thursday. These units include ""medical support, aviation support, logistical support"" and ""combat formation,"" the Pentagon spokesman said. Inside Europe, Kirby said top general of US European Command, Gen. Tod Wolters, was ""taking prudent steps"" to make sure that US troops based in Europe could be moved within the continent if needed. The Pentagon was ""not ruling out"" the possibility that forces in Europe could be moved to ""help bolster capabilities of NATO allies,"" Kirby said. CNN reported Wednesday that the US and a handful of allies are in discussions to deploy thousands more troops to Eastern European NATO countries before any potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as a show of support in the face of Moscow's ongoing aggression, according to three US officials familiar with the discussions. Among the countries considering accepting the deployments are Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The deployments would number approximately 1,000 personnel to each country and would be similar to the forward battle groups currently stationed in the Baltic States and Poland. ""We take our NATO commitment seriously. And we're going to be consulting with allies as we have been certainly in coming days. And if there's ways in which we can help bolster their capabilities to help their defensive postures, we're going to take a serious look at that,"" Kirby said.",4,1.2574820851555977,0.9067140656047679,0.3507680195508298,7

Speaking to foreign reporters Friday, Zelensky said he explained in phone calls to world leaders like US President Joe Biden and France's Emmanuel Macron that, though the threat from the Kremlin is ""imminent and constant,"" Ukrainians have ""learned to live"" with it since Moscow invaded in 2014. ""They are saying tomorrow is the war. This means panic,"" Zelensky said. Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on its border with Ukraine, prompting fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin is planning an incursion. Russia has repeatedly denied it plans to invade its western neighbor. The exact severity of the threat posed by Russia remains unclear and has reportedly been a point of contention between Zelensky and Biden. Their conversation Thursday purportedly did not go well, a senior Ukrainian official told CNN. On the call, which the Ukrainian official described as ""long and frank,"" Biden was said to have warned that a Russian invasion was now virtually certain and imminent, while Zelensky restated his position that the threat from Russia remains ""dangerous but ambiguous."" The White House disputed that account and said that anonymous sources were ""leaking falsehoods."" A spokeswoman said Biden warned Zelensky that an invasion in February was what she called a ""distinct possibility."" When asked about his conversation with Biden, Zelensky thanked the US President for his support, but said the Russian troop build-up was not much more significant than what he had seen in the past. ""I'm the President of Ukraine, I'm based here, and I think I know the details deeper than any other President,"" Zelensky said. ""We don't have any misunderstandings with President Biden. I just deeply understand what is going on in my country just as he understands perfectly well what's going on in the United States."" ""I'm not being critical of President Biden,"" Zelensky added. All sides appear to be holding out for a diplomatic solution, despite the disagreements. Zelensky said he was willing to meet with Putin for a serious conversation and suggested that Biden set up a platform for dialogue between Washington, Kyiv and Moscow. ""People don't understand the value of human life and that's what it's about. I do support serious dialogue,"" Zelensky said. The ball, right now, appears to be in the Kremlin's court. The US and NATO submitted separate written responses to Russia's publicly aired concerns on Wednesday, an overture that Moscow had requested. While the US did not disclose what was in the document, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that it contained ""our own proposals for areas where we may be able to find common ground.""

2022-01-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/politics/us-russia-ukraine-invasion-warning/index.html,Biden says he'll move troops to Eastern Europe as top general warns of 'horrific' outcome if Russia invades Ukraine,"President Joe Biden said Friday that he will move US troops to NATO allies in Eastern Europe in the ""near term,"" marking a new phase in the US response to Russia's escalation on the Ukrainian border, which US officials fear could soon lead to an invasion. ""I will be moving US troops to Eastern Europe in NATO countries in the near term,"" Biden told reporters when asked about a timeline for moving the troops, adding that he did not have any updates on the situation in Ukraine. As many as 8,500 US troops had been placed on heightened alert earlier this week to prepare to deploy to Eastern Europe -- including units with ""medical support, aviation support, logistical support"" and ""combat formation,"" according to a Pentagon spokesman. Biden's comments come hours after the top US military general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, warned a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be ""horrific"" for the country and would result in ""significant"" casualties as he urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to choose a diplomatic path instead. ""Given the type of forces that are arrayed ... if that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant, very significant, and it would result in a significant amount of casualties,"" Milley said at a Pentagon press briefing Friday. ""You can imagine what that might look like in dense urban areas, along roads, and so on and so forth. It would be horrific. It would be terrible. And it's not necessary. And we think a diplomatic outcome is the way to go here."" Milley, who along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin briefed reporters Friday on the US military's preparations, spoke of Ukraine's geography, noting that when its ""high water table"" freezes, ""it makes it for optimal conditions for cross-country tract and wheeled vehicle maneuver."" ""There are many people and highly dense population centers throughout Ukraine. And if war were to break out on a scale and scope that is possible, the civilian population will suffer immensely,"" he said. Milley's remarks stand in contrast to the message coming from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky spoke to Biden by phone Thursday, where the two leaders disagreed on the urgency of the threat Russia poses, and Zelensky reiterated his view speaking in Ukraine Friday that the rhetoric risks causing panic and destabilizing his country's economy. ""They are saying tomorrow is the war. This means panic,"" Zelensky told reporters. But Milley said that he thinks Russia's actions ""feel different"" than previous escalations. ""This is larger in scale and scope in the massing of forces than anything we've seen in recent memory, and I think you'd have to go back quite a while into the Cold War days to see something of this magnitude,"" he said. 'It will not be cost free' Milley noted that the combat capabilities of the Ukrainian military have improved since 2014, ""but they need additional help to defend themselves especially from an invasion force the size that Russia is currently massing."" Still, Milley said that ""if Russia chooses to invade Ukraine, it will not be cost free, in terms of casualties, or other significant effects."" Milley said the US has no intent of putting ""offensive forces"" anywhere to ""attack Russia,"" adding that the current situation between Russia and Ukraine ""is entirely engineered by Russia and President Putin."" Austin said that no decision had been made yet to deploy the US forces on heightened alert to Eastern Europe. He said the main goal of troops, which would primarily be deployed to support NATO's quick response force, was about ""reassuring our allies."" ""This is about our allies trusting us. And so, that's really what we're focused on,"" Austin said. ""And we, you know, Mr. Putin, at some point, will reveal what he's thinking. But again, I'm not sure that he's made the final decisions on what he's going to do yet."" Russia has continued to claim it is not planning to attack Ukraine. In an interview with Russian journalists Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, ""if it is up to the Russian Federation, there will be no war. We don't want a war."" While the Biden administration ""welcomed"" that message, a senior administration official said, it had to be backed up with action. ""We need to see Russia pulling some of the troops that they have deployed away from the Ukrainian border and taking other de-escalatory steps,"" the administration official said on a call Friday. UN Security Council will meet on Ukraine Monday The United States requested a United Nations Security Council meeting Monday on Ukraine, which it sees as an opportunity for Russia ""to explain its extraordinary military buildup on Ukraine's borders and its other threats and destabilizing acts,"" the senior administration official said Friday. ""While I do think there will be some deflection and perhaps some disinformation -- we know that playbook -- but there's also a clear opportunity for Russia to tell the Security Council whether they see a path for diplomacy or are interested in pursuing conflict,"" the official said. ""And I also think this will be an opportunity -- and will be very important -- for Russia to hear the position that other council members take on these fundamental principles of the international order."" ""We hope and expect that our council colleagues will express their desire to pursue a path of diplomacy rather than the path of war,"" the official said. The official said the US felt ""it would be a dereliction of the Security Council's duties to take a wait and see approach,"" and said US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield will ""present the facts of the case and clearly articulate what's at stake for European and global peace and security."" There is no statement or Council action expected from the meeting. A second official said the US Mission to the UN has been actively engaged with others in New York, including Ukraine, other European nations including Germany, China and Russia. ""We've been in very active dialogue with China, obviously about range of issues, but also, in particular, this situation, Russia and Ukraine,"" they said.

""There is no positive reaction on the main issue in this document,"" Sergey Lavrov told journalists in Moscow. ""The main issue is our clear position on the inadmissibility of further expansion of NATO to the East and the deployment of strike weapons that could threaten the territory of the Russian Federation."" Tensions between Moscow and Kyiv are at their highest in years, with a large Russian troop buildup near the shared borders of the two former Soviet republics. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning an invasion but has argued that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on its western flank. Lavrov explained the US and NATO had previously agreed within the context of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) not to expand at the expense of Russia's safety. ""We present non-verbal promises, written documents signed by the leaders of all the OSCE countries, including the President of the United States (Istanbul Declaration of 1999, Astana Declaration of 2010), our Western partners have to get out from a more serious situation,"" Lavrov explained. ""This principle is clearly stated. It has two main interrelated approaches. First, the right of every state to freely choose military alliances is recognized. Second: the obligation of each state not to strengthen its security at the expense of the security of others."" ""In other words, the right to choose alliances is clearly conditioned by the need to take into account the security interests of any other OSCE state, including the Russian Federation,"" Lavrov concluded. The Russian Foreign Minister conceded the responses by the US and NATO could lead to serious discussions but only on secondary issues. ""There is a reaction there that allows us to count on the beginning of a serious conversation, but on secondary topics,"" he said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov echoed the same concerns on Thursday, saying on the surface, Russia's prime concerns had not been addressed. He however refused to give an official definitive answer to the responses presented by the US and NATO. Peskov told journalists during a conference call that Vladimir Putin had read the written responses from both the US and NATO, but added that Russia's President and his government won't be rushing into any conclusions. ""The President already read the written responses,"" he said. ""All the papers are with the President. It will take some time to analyze them, we will not rush to any conclusions."" Russia's official response would not take long but Peskov cautioned it wouldn't happen straight away. NATO sees 'room for progress' US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the US's written response to Russia ""sets out a serious diplomatic path forward should Russia choose it."" The US has repeatedly said Putin's central demand, that the US and NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine to the alliance, is non-negotiable. Blinken declined to detail specifics presented to Moscow in the written response, but reiterated the West's public response to uphold NATO's ""open-door policy,"" rejecting Moscow's demands that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine. ""There is no change. There will be no change,"" Blinken said of US and NATO support for the alliance's open-door policy. ""We make clear that there are core principles that we are committed to uphold and defend, including Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the right of states to choose their own security arrangements and alliances,"" he added. NATO's Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday that the alliance's written response was sent in ""parallel with the United States."" Although the positions of Moscow and the alliance are ""far apart,"" the NATO chief outlined three main areas where NATO sees ""room for progress."" He asked that Moscow and NATO reopen their ""respective offices in Moscow and in Brussels."" It is unclear whether the latest diplomatic overture, which Moscow had sought, will change the course of talks between Russia and the West that have continued over the past several weeks. Russian Deputy Foreign Ministry Alexey Zaytsev told journalists Thursday that they consider the idea of war between Russia and Ukraine ""unacceptable"" adding that a discussion on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine in Paris ""was not easy"" and ended without result. He was referring to Wednesday's meeting of the so-called Normandy Format -- a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France -- that has been trying to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Zaytsev said he hoped for a different outcome when the four countries meet again in Berlin in two weeks. ""There is no alternative to the Minsk agreements,"" he said in reference to the framework for peace in the region that has repeatedly failed since it was first partially implemented in 2015. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a positive assessment of the talks, in a Thursday statement that described the discussion as meaningful. Zelensky also spoke with US President Biden on Thursday in a call that ""did not go well,"" according to a senior Ukrainian official, with disagreements resurfacing on the ""risk levels"" regarding a possible Russian attack. The White House, however, disputed the official's account, warning that anonymous sources were ""leaking falsehoods."" They did state that Biden warned Zelensky an imminent invasion is a ""distinct possibility."" On the call, which the Ukrainian official described as ""long and frank,"" Biden warned his Ukrainian counterpart that a Russian attack may be imminent, saying that an invasion was now virtually certain, once the ground had frozen later in February, according to the official. Zelensky, however, restated his position that the threat from Russia remains ""dangerous but ambiguous,"" and it is not certain that an attack will take place, the official said. Troop buildup rings alarm bells Ukrainians -- who have been at war for nearly eight years since Russia annexed Crimea and Russia-backed separatists took control of the eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Luhansk -- are desperate for reprieve from the drumbeats of war. In an opinion article published on CNN, Olesia Markovic described how the Russian troop buildup at the border was ringing alarm bells for Ukrainian society. ""People admit the uncertainty and the lack of clear emergency instructions are draining their intellectual and emotional resources, making it hard to focus on current tasks and their ability to make long-term plans,"" she writes. On Thursday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow, not Kyiv, must make concessions to defuse tensions in the region. ""The logic that Ukraine always has to make concessions in order to prevent Russia from being more aggressive... doesn't work this way,"" Kuleba told journalists during a visit to Copenhagen. ""I firmly believe that it's important for Western countries to succeed in this particular crisis, for the reasons that I mentioned, because in recent years, Russia has been attacking not only Ukraine,"" he said, pointing to Moscow using gas supplies, alleged cyberattacks and other tactics to hit the West.",4,0.8302141421104507,0.7716306816379301,0.05858346047252061,17

The announcement came after a meeting at the Elysee Palace of the so-called Normandy Format -- a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France -- that has been trying to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Tensions between Moscow and Kyiv are at their highest in years, with a large Russian troop build-up near the shared borders of the two former Soviet republics -- spurring fears that Russia could launch an invasion. Speaking after Wednesday's meeting, Moscow's chief negotiator Dmitry Kozak said the ceasefire must be observed ""unconditionally"" but that many other issues in eastern Ukraine remained unresolved. Western officials are continuing to push for a diplomatic solution to the tensions through the full implementation of the Minsk agreements -- a ceasefire protocol signed by Ukraine and Russia in 2015. ""We agreed that regardless of different discrepancies of the Minsk agreements that exist between Ukraine and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the truce in Donbas must be observed unconditionally,"" Kozak said. He added that the ""obligation"" to implement such agreements ""lies with the armed forces of Ukraine and the armed formations of the (eastern separatists) Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic."" Ukrainian negotiator Andriy Yermak said all parties were in support of a permanent ceasefire and Ukraine was ready to negotiate around the clock to prevent war and to de-escalate tensions around the border. Yermak called the renewal of the Normandy Format talks -- first held after Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea -- a ""very positive signal"" and the first such substantive agreement since the end of 2019. He called talks ""really substantial, but not an easy discussion"" and while there were still disagreements there was an interest in working through them. ""The work continues and I can tell you that Ukraine as usual is ready to negotiate, to meet 24-7. Because for us, for (Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelensky, for the entire team, the goal of stopping the war, of ending the war and returning our territories -- and today that this also includes easing the tensions -- the de-escalation around the Ukrainian border, is the priority,"" Yermak said. Kozak and Yermak said the talks would resume in about two weeks in Berlin. Russia's NATO concerns As many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Russian President Vladimir Putin order an invasion. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning an invasion but has argued that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on its western flank. On Thursday, Russia's Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev accused NATO of failing to keep its non-expansion ""promise,"" saying the alliance had moved closer to Russian borders, state news agency TASS reported. Medvedev said a process of negotiations on security guarantees is the only way to settle the current tensions between Russia, Ukraine and the West. ""They promised not to expand NATO, but didn't keep the promise,"" Medvedev said, according to TASS. ""They say that 'we did not sign anything.' But we all know well who and when granted to whom such promises, such assurances."" Medvedev added: ""Everything must be done to avoid any war."" NATO's 'open-door' policy As the Normandy Format got underway on Wednesday, the United States delivered a written response to Russia's concerns over Ukraine. Putin's central demand is that the US and NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine to the 30-member defense alliance.

Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said that the Winter Olympics in Beijing could impact Putin's thinking about potential military action, noting at a virtual European think tank event Wednesday that she thinks Chinese President Xi Jinping ""would not be ecstatic if Putin chose that moment to invade Ukraine."" The Beijing Olympics kick off at the beginning of February and Putin plans to be there, Sherman added. There's some history involving Russia's military action and the Olympics. Russia's invasion of Crimea occurred in 2014 just as the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, were wrapping up. In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia during the Summer Olympics in Beijing. The Biden administration has been warning that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent as Moscow has amassed tens of thousands of troops along the border with Ukraine. The Pentagon on Monday announced up to 8,500 troops were placed on heightened alert for a possible deployment to Eastern Europe to support NATO countries amid Russia's escalation. On Monday, China's foreign ministry denied a report that it might have asked Putin not to further invade Ukraine during the Winter Olympics. The response came in reference to a Bloomberg article, which cited an unnamed diplomatic source in Beijing who raised the possibility that Chinese President Xi Jinping had asked Putin to not invade Ukraine during the Games in a call between the two leaders in December. ""The report is purely made up out of thin air. It seeks not only to smear and drive a wedge in China-Russia relations, but also to deliberately disrupt and undermine the Beijing Winter Olympics,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in a briefing Monday. The Kremlin also denied the reporting, calling it ""fake news and a way to inflame tensions,"" Russian state news agency TASS reported Monday. Sherman, who did not suggest the US had any intelligence on how the Olympics could influence the Kremlin's actions surrounding Ukraine, said Wednesday she suspects that ""even the people around"" Putin don't know what he will do. But she said the US sees ""every indication that he is going to use military force, sometime perhaps now and middle of February."" ""I think they know the plans of setting up the military to be ready to go, and to have plans to make use of the military, but I suspect the President has other plans in mind as well. And I have no idea if he's made the ultimate decision,"" she said at an event hosted by Yalta European Strategy. The Winter Olympics run from February 4 through February 20.",4,1.9621743607330324,2.775120249310447,-0.8129458885774148,20
2022-01-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/us-allies-discuss-deploying-more-troops/index.html,US and allies discussing deploying more troops to Eastern Europe prior to any Russian invasion of Ukraine,"The US and a handful of allies are in discussions to deploy thousands more troops to Eastern European NATO countries before any potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as a show of support in the face of Moscow's ongoing aggression, three US officials familiar with the discussions tell CNN. Among the countries considering accepting the deployments are Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The deployments would number approximately 1,000 personnel to each country and would be similar to the forward battle groups currently stationed in the Baltic States and Poland. The US and UK are among those considering the new, pre-invasion deployments, but not all 30 NATO members are willing, according to a European diplomat. NATO allies have not been entirely on the same page about the severity of the threat, and Germany, for example, has refused to sell new weaponry to Ukraine. Therefore, the US is in discussions to send the additional forces on a bilateral basis or, as one official described it, as a ""coalition of the willing."" Broadly, the US military goal would be to ""meet the capability"" NATO allies in the region are asking for, another defense official said last week. US forces could operate, as they already do, unilaterally in Europe, but could also operate under existing NATO command structures. The possibility of deploying some forces closer to Russia's doorstep before an invasion marks a shift by the administration, which had previously been wary of the risk of further provoking Moscow. The move could be weaponized by the Kremlin as an example of the kind of aggressive NATO posture that Russia has been using to justify its buildup of forces along Ukraine's borders. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said on Monday that the US has put 8,500 troops in the US on heightened alert in case a NATO Response Force is called up and American forces are needed quickly. However, the vast majority of these forces are intended for activity supported by the full NATO alliance. The US and NATO have tens of thousands of other troops already in Europe to draw on for any additional deployments to Eastern European allies. Kirby told CNN on Tuesday that some troops are also on heightened alert ""just for our own United States purposes to see if there's a need for us to continue to reassure on a bilateral basis with some of our NATO allies over in Europe."" And President Joe Biden also said on Tuesday that he ""may be moving some of those troops in the nearer term, just because it takes time"" and because the US' eastern European allies have ""reason for concern."" President Biden was originally planning to deliver remarks to the public on the situation with Russia as early as this week, two sources said, but it is now unclear whether he will as the White House continues to try and engage with Russia diplomatically. The military planning comes as the US has become increasingly concerned that a further Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any time and on short notice. ""When we said it was imminent, it remains imminent,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a daily briefing on Tuesday. ""But again, we can't make a prediction of what decision President Putin will make. We're still engaged in diplomatic discussions and negotiations."" Ukrainian officials pushed back on Psaki's language on Tuesday, calling the situation with Russia ""dangerous"" but not ""imminent."" A source close to Ukrainian leadership said Tuesday that the defense and intelligence chiefs are analyzing satellite images of Russian forces ""from US and other western agencies"" on an hourly basis, but are not yet seeing Russia ""getting into combat mode, or positioning themselves to attack."" If any Russian order to attack is given, the source added, Ukraine believes it would still take between one and two weeks for Russian forces near the border to be ready. In its written responses to Russia's security demands, which US officials could present to the Kremlin as soon as Wednesday, the US is unlikely to allow any room for negotiation on NATO's open-door policy, which is President Vladimir Putin's central grievance. For that reason, there is some concern within the administration that Moscow will use the US response as a pretext to say diplomacy has failed. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify that the US and allies are discussing deployments of approximately 1,000 troops to Eastern European countries including Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary.",4,2.2221885909329733,1.1478378534113527,1.0743507375216206,7
2022-01-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/europe/ukraine-russia-latest-news-wednesday-intl/index.html,Ukrainian Foreign Minister says current Russian troop numbers insufficient for full invasion,"Russia has not assembled sufficient forces to launch an imminent full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Wednesday, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov threatened ""appropriate response measures"" if the West continues its ""aggressive line."" Kuleba told reporters in Kyiv that Russian troops could attack Ukraine at any time, as had been the case since 2014 when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, but currently would not be able to mount a full offensive. ""The number of Russian troops amassed along the border of Ukraine and in occupied territories is large, it poses a threat -- a direct threat to Ukraine,"" said Kuleba. ""However, as we speak this number is insufficient for a full-scale offensive along the entire Ukrainian border. They also lack some important military indicators and systems to conduct such a large full-scale offensive,"" he added. ""We can say 100 times a day invasion is imminent, but this doesn't change the situation on the ground."" Ukraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. Kuleba told reporters that a military invasion is not the only threat to Ukraine. ""We see a scenario of destabilization of Ukraine and that scenario is imminent, it's already taking place -- by spreading panic, by putting pressure on Ukraine's financial system, by conducting cyber-attacks against Ukraine,"" he said. ""I am certain President [Vladimir] Putin would be happy to see this plan succeed so he doesn't even have to resort to military force to put Ukraine in an extremely vulnerable position."" He added: ""Priority number one today is to keep things under control, to be realistic in the assessment of immediate threat while not diminishing the threat of potential military invasion."" Earlier Wednesday, Sergiy Korsunsky, Ukraine's Ambassador to Japan, said he does not expect all-out war with Russia. ""I am optimistic. I believe that full scale war is very, very, very difficult to expect but we may see more localized conflict, unfortunately,"" Korsunsky said during a speech in Tokyo about Ukraine-Japan relations. ""But if it comes to military terms, let me tell you, we are very much ready. Our army is very well prepared. And you have a population which is very well motivated,"" Korsunsky said. ""It is an absolute nonsense to think, as some Russian analysts say, that once we see the approaching of Russian forces, there will be uprising, there will be change in the government. No way,"" he added. A source close to the Ukrainian leadership told CNN on Tuesday that the latest military intelligence suggests Russian forces are not yet prepared to stage an imminent invasion into the country. Russia will not allow 'endless discussion' Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov addressed the country's State Duma on Wednesday and repeated his desire for assurances from the US regarding security measures. Lavrov met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Geneva, Switzerland, on January 21, and Russia has submitted ""concrete requests,"" he said. Russia has asked the US and NATO for certain security guarantees, including binding pledges that NATO won't admit Ukraine or expand further east. ""We will not allow any attempts to wind up our initiative in endless discussion,"" said Lavrov on Wednesday. ""If there won't be any constructive response and the West will continue its aggressive line, then as the President said multiple times, Moscow will take appropriate response measures."" The US gave Moscow its written responses aimed at deterring a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Blinken announced Wednesday. The response was delivered in person to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan. The written document outlined areas where the US has publicly said it sees potential for progress with Russia -- arms control, transparency and stability, the top US diplomat told reporters at the State Department. The purpose of providing the response in written form -- a demand Russia has made since they put written ideas forward in December -- is to fuel the diplomacy the US hopes will deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine, State Department officials said earlier. ""We're taking this step by step, but we don't want to be the ones to foreclose the possible diplomatic solution,"" a senior State Department official told reporters after the meeting in Geneva. Blinken said in Geneva that US and Russian officials would meet again after the written proposal was sent to Russia. Later on Wednesday, Ukrainian negotiator Adriy Yermak said that all parties were in support of a permanent ceasefire and that Ukraine was ready to negotiate around the clock to prevent war and to de-escalate tensions around the border. Yermak was speaking after hourslong talks between Ukraine and Russia at the Elysee Palace in Paris under the Normandy Format -- a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. He said that the renewal of the Normandy Format talks, first initiated after the 2014 Crimea invasion, was a ""very positive signal,"" and that talks would resume in about two weeks in Berlin. Meanwhile, Kristina Kvien, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, told CNN's Sam Kiley that arms shipped to the country on Wednesday are ready to be deployed. ""We are trying to make it very clear to Russia that if they go in, it will not be easy,"" said Kvien, the US chargé d'affaires. The 300 Javelin anti-tank missiles, 800 bunker-busting bombs and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition delivered by the US ""can be deployed immediately,"" she added. ""They can be deployed to the border."" Kvien also warned Putin to expect stiff resistance from Ukrainians if Russia does invade. ""I have been here over two-and-a-half years,"" she said. ""I can tell you, Ukrainians will fight. They are patriotic, they will stand and fight."" Moscow risks being made ""an international pariah"" if it invades its neighbor, she added. ""I don't think that's necessarily a legacy you want to leave,"" she said of President Putin.",4,1.6733920470770056,2.1181356161127223,-0.44474356903571666,20
2022-01-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/25/politics/white-house-ukraine-russia/index.html,Biden says no one knows what Putin will do after White House called Russian invasion of Ukraine 'imminent',"President Joe Biden acknowledged Tuesday a deeply uncertain situation at the Ukraine border, where Russian troops are amassing but few observers have any definitive knowledge of whether or when they might invade. Earlier, the White House said a Russian invasion was ""imminent,"" and American troops have been placed on high alert to deploy to Europe in a show of reassurance. US and European sanctions have been readied in the event of an invasion. Biden also said he'd be willing to apply sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin himself, a step previous presidents have avoided. Even as tensions mount, however, Biden conceded that one man's opaque decision-making would determine how events unfold. ""This is all Putin. I don't even think his people know for certain what he will do,"" Biden said as he made a brief outing in Washington for ice cream and to browse a local store, purchasing gifts for his wife and grandson. And Biden revealed he could move US troops into Eastern Europe soon to demonstrate American commitment to its NATO allies: ""I may be moving some of those troops in the near term just because it takes time. And again, it's not provocative,"" he said. Still, Biden made clear Putin remains something of an enigma, whose vague intentions have have proved befuddling to him and other western leaders. ""I'll be completely honest with you, it is a little bit like reading tea leaves,"" Biden said after browsing a small gift shop and selecting a sweatshirt for his grandson. ""Ordinarily, if it were a different leader, the fact that he continues to build forces along Ukraine's border, from Belarus all the way around, you'd say, 'Well, that means that he is looking like he is going to do something,'"" Biden went on. ""But then you look at what his past behavior is and what everyone is saying and his team as well as everyone else as to what is likely to happen, it all comes down to his decision."" Biden has spent the past several days receiving updates on the matter, and on Monday ordered 8,500 US troops to stand ready to deploy to eastern Europe. He made clear again Tuesday that no American forces would move into Ukraine. Further US military assistance to Ukraine arrived Tuesday with approximately 300 Javelins and 79 tons of equipment arriving in the country, the US embassy in Kyiv said in a tweet. Diplomatic efforts continue Even as military preparations get underway, diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis were proceeding. Russian and European officials planned to meet in Paris this week to continue discussions on reviving a ceasefire agreement in Eastern Ukraine, and the US was preparing written responses to Russian security demands that were presented last month. Last week, Biden predicted Putin would ultimately decide to move into Ukraine, and he said Tuesday that little had changed to alter his view. ""There's been no change in the posture of the Russian forces,"" he said. Earlier, his spokeswoman described a Russian invasion of Ukraine as ""imminent,"" though in Kyiv, Ukrainian leaders have sought to downplay the threat. ""When we said it was imminent, it remains imminent,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said during a daily briefing. ""But again, we can't make a prediction of what decision President Putin will make. We're still engaged in diplomatic discussions and negotiations."" An administration official told CNN after the briefing that ""there has been no change in where we have been since last week which is that Russia could invade at any time."" Ukrainian officials said Tuesday the latest military intelligence suggests Russian forces are not yet prepared to stage an invasion into the country, and downplayed the prospect of an impending invasion. Speaking to CNN, a source close to the Ukrainian leadership said defense and intelligence chiefs are analyzing satellite images of Russian forces ""from US and other Western agencies"" on an hourly basis, but are not yet seeing Russia ""getting into combat mode or positioning themselves to attack."" The threat from Russia is ""dangerous, but not imminent,"" the source said, adding if any Russian order to attack is given it would still take one to two weeks for Russian forces near the border to be ready. Psaki said that signals from Russia were clear, even if Putin's intentions were not. ""No one can get into the mind of President Putin or Russian leadership. We all know that is the case. What we have seen is a range of preparations,"" she said, citing the build-up of more than 100,000 troops at the Russia-Ukraine border, ""bellicose rhetoric"" and potential false flag operations. On Monday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address posted to his official Facebook page that his citizens had ""no reason to panic"" as authorities are ""working for the full de-escalation of the situation"" in eastern Ukraine. Other Ukrainian officials have also sought to project calm, including the defense minister, who said Tuesday there was ""no need to have your bags packed."" As they seek to demonstrate a level of stability, officials in Ukraine have voiced displeasure at a decision to draw down staffing at the US embassy in Kyiv, calling it unnecessary. ""We believe such a step to be a premature one & an instance of excessive caution,"" a spokesman for the country's foreign ministry said in a tweet. Psaki said Tuesday displeasure from the Ukrainian government at the US decision to withdraw some embassy staff was misplaced. ""We're always going to make decisions that are in the security interests of people who are serving as diplomats around the world, and we have assessments that are made by the State Department, hence the decision in the announcement made over the last couple of days,"" she said. ""I will let others assess, but there are 100,000 Russian troops on the border of Ukraine and no clarity that the leader of Russia doesn't intend to invade,"" she said. ""That sounds pretty dangerous to me."" In any case, a vast majority of US personnel at the US Embassy in Kyiv are staying at the post and are not taking advantage of voluntary departure, a source familiar with the matter told CNN Tuesday. The source said there has not been a significant drawdown as a result of the authorized departure of US personnel.",4,1.2158952459710635,1.7786062742576998,-0.5627110282866363,7
2022-01-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/25/europe/ukraine-nato-russia-coverage-tv-media-cmd-intl/index.html,The West fears Russia is about to attack Ukraine. But that's not the way Russians are seeing it on TV,"Foreign forces bristling with weapons are rolling toward the Ukrainian border. Reconnaissance planes streak overhead. Rumors of ""false flag"" operations run rampant. If you're watching state TV in Moscow, you're seeing video of troops and tanks, barbed wire and snipers taking aim, but it's not Russia's forces that are poised for attack -- it's NATO's. Welcome to Russia's mirror-image depiction of the showdown over Ukraine. In the country's alternate media landscape, NATO forces are carrying out a plan that's been in the works for years: Encircle Russia, topple President Vladimir Putin and seize control of Russia's energy resources. In Moscow's view, repeated in nearly every newscast and talk show, Ukraine is a failed state entirely controlled by the ""puppet master"" -- the United States. Europe is a weak and divided collection of lap dogs taking orders from Washington. Even the US, as frighteningly threatening as it is, is weak and divided too, torn apart by political division and racial unrest. But wait. How can those powers be a threat -- and be weak at the same time? That's one of the conundrums of Russian state propaganda. Thinking things through isn't what they're trying to encourage. Rather they're trying to raise the blood pressure of their viewers -- and to make them very afraid. Russian state TV's flagship political news show, Dmitry Kiselyov's ""Vesti Nedeli"" (""News of the Week""), opened this past Sunday with Kiselyov saying: ""Instead of answers to the peaceful initiatives of the Kremlin, they're burying us with accusations and new threats."" Any hint of disagreement between Europe and the US or NATO is headline news in Russia, and one of the top stories on Kiselyov's show featured comments by Germany's naval chief that Putin ""deserves respect"" and that Crimea -- a Ukrainian territory annexed by Moscow -- is ""gone forever."" The report ended on the satisfied note that the officer had to resign. Ukraine may not be caught up in a full-blown invasion for now, but there is already an all-out war of words in Russian media. US government statements are dismissed as comments from the ""Ministry of Information,"" and Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov has accused Washington of ""information hysterics,"" ""lies"" and ""fakes."" (The word ""fake"" is now a Russian word, pronounced pretty much the same as the English.) And maps on Russian state TV showing Russia's ally Belarus surrounded by NATO forces bear an uncanny resemblance to maps in Western media reports showing Ukraine surrounded on three sides by Russian troops. Accusations of possible Russian attacks on Ukraine are dismissed as the ""half-mythological threat from Russia"" or as ""Russophobia"" from the ""Anglo-Saxons."" Tensions aren't high because of Russia, the Kremlin says -- it's because of NATO. In a striking piece of mirror-image propaganda, Russian TV has taken to re-broadcasting, with translation, comments by Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson, whose anti-NATO and anti-US President Joe Biden screeds neatly align with the Kremlin's line. ""He [Carlson] ought to be on your show!"" one guest on a Russian talk show told the anchor. The state media blitz seems to be having an effect. A December poll by the non-governmental polling and sociological research organization the Levada-Center, showed that half of respondents blame the US and NATO for tensions, while only 3% to 4% blame Russia. The poll found that slightly more than half of Russians believe the crisis in Ukraine will not escalate into a war between Russia and Ukraine, with more than a third (39%) saying that they think war is ""inevitable,"" or ""very likely."" A quarter of respondents said they think a war is possible between Russia and NATO. In another poll from Levada-Center, also from December, more than half of respondents (56%) said relations between Russia and NATO have seriously deteriorated, the highest result since the conflict with Ukraine began in 2014. And more than half of respondents (56%) say they are worried there will be a world war. Many Russians think they're being dragged into a war by the West, according to a focus group conducted by Riddle, an online journal on Russian affairs. ""Russia will have to respond ... We are being pinched from all sides; they're biting us. What are we supposed to do? Give in?"" one focus group respondent said. Meanwhile, Levada-Center pollsters say Russians are ""mentally fatigued"" by the topic of Ukraine which, they say, ""seems to be imposed by major media outlets."" As a result, viewers don't analyze the news or double-check what they hear from TV show hosts. To be sure, the Russian media landscape is shifting, as a younger generation goes online to get information. But most alternative news outlets in Russia have been shut down or marginalized -- and the Kremlin's parallel reality continues to dominate the airwaves.

Kuleba emphasized that the country would not accept any compromises aimed at placating Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid fears Russia may be planning to invade Ukraine -- something Moscow denies. ""If anyone makes a concession on Ukraine, behind Ukraine's back, first, we will not accept that. We will not be in the position of the country that picks up the phone, hears the instruction of the big power and follows it,"" said Kuleba. ""We paid a lot -- including 15,000 lives of our citizens -- to secure the right to decide our own future, our own destiny,"" he insisted. Ukraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. Kuleba said he has no doubts about the US's commitment to defending Ukraine, despite comments from President Joe Biden suggesting that a ""minor incursion"" by Russian troops might not lead to a severe response from the NATO military alliance. ""First, President Biden is personally committed to Ukraine. He knows this country, and he doesn't want Russia to destroy it,"" said Kuleba. ""Second, we heard from those US officials, speaking openly to the media, but also speaking to me and to other Ukrainian officials directly on the phone, that the United States will remain absolutely committed to slashing Russia if any type of incursion, invasion, interference takes place,"" he added. 'We have to be strong' Kuleba called the US's plan to reduce staff levels at its embassy in Kyiv, beginning with the departure of nonessential staff and family members, ""premature."" He said he respected every country's right to protect its citizens, but added that an evacuation ""spreads panic"" and plays into Putin's aim ""to destabilize Ukraine from the inside and to make us weaker without resorting to military force."" The minister said the US was ""definitely not"" overstating the threat from Russia. On Monday around 8,500 US troops were placed on heightened alert for possible deployment to Eastern Europe. Kuleba praised the decision and rejected suggestions that the move could anger Putin and escalate the crisis further. ""If we learned anything since 2014, it's that it's flawed logic to handle President Putin from the perspective: 'Let's do nothing in order not to make him angry.' This is not how it works,"" he said. ""Strength, resolve, deterrence; these are the three elements that work with Putin, he respects strength, this is the fact."" In March 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. ""We have to be smart, we have to be reasonable, but we have to be strong,"" said Kuleba. ""If he feels the slightest signs of weakness, it will only prompt him to further escalate and to resort to war. And that's what we have to avoid."" 'Space for diplomacy' Kuleba believes Putin has ""shot himself in the foot"" with the troop build-up, adding that there is very little Moscow can gain from the current situation that would save face. ""He put himself in this situation, no one else pushed him in that deadlock,"" Kuleba said. ""The set of demands put forward by Russia is designed in a way that if Russia is willing to act in good faith, there is a possibility to walk out of the negotiating room and say we made a deal."" Russia has asked the US and NATO for certain security guarantees, including binding pledges that NATO won't admit Ukraine or expand further east. Putin has emphasized that these demands are not an ""ultimatum,"" and Kuleba believes Russia is willing to talk.

2022-01-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/25/europe/nato-jens-stoltenberg-russia-ukraine-proposals-amanpour-intl/index.html,"NATO chief: Still a 'diplomatic way out' of Ukraine conflict, as military alliance prepares written proposal for Russia","NATO will send a written proposal to the Kremlin later this week to ""try to find a way forward"" amid growing tensions over Russia's troop build-up on Ukraine's border, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. ""We will outline that we are ready to sit down ... and discuss arms control, disarmament, transparency on military activities, risk reduction mechanisms, and other issues which are relevant for European security. And also to sit down and listen to Russian concerns,"" Stoltenberg said. The NATO chief said last week that the Western military alliance would soon send its written proposals to Russia, responding to Moscow's security demands and suggest serious talks on arms control and measures of transparency on military activities and missile deployments. Stoltenberg's comments came a day after NATO announced that some member countries were putting forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter jets to Eastern Europe. The moves signaled mounting fears of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, following months of military maneuvering by Moscow that has set off a tit-for-tat series of escalations with NATO. Speaking from Brussels, Stoltenberg said there is ""still a diplomatic way out"" of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, ""but that requires that Russia de-escalates and is ready to engage in good faith in political talks with NATO and NATO allies."" Russia has deployed tens of thousands of troops near its border with Ukraine since last year, and is sending forces into neighboring Belarus for joint exercises next month that Ukrainian officials fear could serve as a ""full-fledged theater of operations"" from which to launch an attack. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. ""NATO will not deploy NATO combat troops to Ukraine, but we need to be sure that there is no misunderstanding about our readiness, our commitment to defend all allies, especially in the eastern part of the alliance,"" Stoltenberg told CNN, explaining that was why the alliance had increased its presence in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Black Sea and Baltic regions. In a statement on Monday, NATO said that member states had announced a number of deployments to Eastern Europe in recent days. They include Denmark sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 fighter jets to Lithuania; the Netherlands deploying two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria; France expressing its readiness to send troops to Romania; and the US considering increasing its military presence in the East. There was no suggestion in the statement that the troops would be used to assist Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. Stoltenberg told CNN that NATO was weighing whether to further increase its position with ""enhanced forward presence or battlegroups, also in the southeast of the alliance."" ""Strong deterrence is the best way to prevent any attack on any NATO ally and the best way to prevent a conflict,"" he added. High-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped earlier this month without any breakthroughs, leaving prospects of de-escalation and future diplomacy in doubt. The US and its NATO allies had hoped the talks could spur Russia to pursue a path of ""de-escalation and diplomacy,"" but Russian officials were incensed over the US and NATO's refusal to entertain a contentious list of security demands.

2022-01-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/politics/biden-troops-europe/index.html,"US places up to 8,500 troops on alert for possible deployment to Eastern Europe amid Russia tensions","As many as 8,500 US troops have been put on heightened alert for a possible deployment to Eastern Europe as Russian troops mass on Ukraine's border, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin issued the prepare to deploy orders at the direction of President Joe Biden, the latest step the US has taken to prepare for a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine that officials have warned could be imminent. Kirby said that the ""bulk of"" US troops placed on heightened alert were intended to bolster NATO's quick response force, but added they would be ""postured to be ready for any other contingencies as well."" As of Monday afternoon, no final decision to deploy the troops had been made, Kirby emphasized. ""The United States has taken steps to heighten the readiness of its forces at home and abroad, so they are prepared to respond to a range of contingencies, including support to the NATO response force if it is activated,"" Kirby said. He noted the NATO Response Force ""comprises around 40,000 multinational troops."" Earlier on Monday CNN reported the Biden administration was in in the final stages of identifying specific military units it wants to send to Eastern Europe, according to multiple US and defense officials. Biden discussed options for bolstering US troop levels in the Baltics and Eastern Europe with his top military officials during a briefing at Camp David on Saturday, according to a senior official. The goal of sending military reinforcements to Eastern Europe would be to provide deterrence and to reassure allies, and there's been no suggestion US combat troops would deploy to Ukraine or take part in any combat roles. Kirby noted the US does have military advisers in Ukraine. Kirby would not say where the US troops might deploy, but said the US has ""made it clear to the Eastern flank allies that we're prepared to bolster their capabilities if they need it."" ""In the event of NATO's activation of the NRF or a deteriorating security environment, the United States would be in a position to rapidly deploy additional brigade combat teams, logistics, medical, aviation, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, transportation and additional capabilities into Europe,"" Kirby said. The news comes amid US warnings that a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent. The State Department on Sunday reduced staffing at the US embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, with the departure of nonessential staff and family members out of ""an abundance of caution."" Biden holds calls with European leaders Biden held an 80-minute secure video call with European leaders on Monday afternoon, which the White House said was part of the administration's consultation and coordination with European allies in response to Russia's military buildup. Biden told reporters at the White House there was ""total unanimity"" with European leaders on the call. ""I had a very, very, very good meeting,"" Biden said. A White House readout of the call said the leaders discussed ""preparations to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia for such actions as well as to reinforce security on NATO's eastern flank."" Following the virtual meeting with the leaders of the US, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom and the European Union, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said, ""We agree that any further aggression by Russia against Ukraine will have severe costs."" Biden and his national security team have been refining military plans ""for all scenarios,"" including the option of sending troops to Eastern Europe ahead of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, the White House said Monday. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said a decision to increase US troops could come ahead of Russian forces moving across the Ukrainian border, but said such a move did not amount to a shift in Biden's thinking. ""We have never ruled out the option of providing additional assistance in advance of an invasion. Those discussions have been ongoing,"" she said. Last week, Biden said during a news conference, ""We're going to actually increase troop presence in Poland, in Romania, et cetera, if in fact he moves."" But Psaki said Biden had never ruled out sending additional US troops before an invasion. ""That's been part of our contingency planning,"" she said. The US sent two weapons shipments to Ukraine over the past week as part of recently directed security assistance to help bolster Ukraine's military. NATO countries are also sending additional ships and fighter jets to Eastern Europe and putting forces on standby, Stoltenberg said in a statement Monday. ""NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance,"" he said. US and UK reduce embassy staffing in Kyiv The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest intelligence assessment found that Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops in the region, while US officials have said Russia is in a position to launch an invasion at any time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address Monday that Ukrainian citizens have ""no reason to panic"" as authorities are ""working for the full de-escalation of the situation"" in eastern Ukraine. US officials still don't know what Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to do, or if he has decided to invade Ukraine. But some officials who have seen the intelligence say there is evidence Russia is planning to try to take Kyiv and overthrow the government, as CNN has previously reported. The UK foreign office said in a statement on Saturday that it has information the Russian government is planning to ""install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv as it considers whether to invade and occupy Ukraine."" Kirby said Monday that Russia continues to add ""battalion tactical groups"" to the border with Ukraine and in Belarus. ""They have not only shown no signs of de-escalating, but they are in fact adding more force capability,"" he said. Moscow denies it is planning to invade, accusing the US and NATO of escalating tensions over their support for Ukraine. The Kremlin on Monday dismissed the reports about plans to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine as ""hysteria. ""Tensions are escalating due to concrete actions taken by the US and NATO,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""I mean, the informational hysteria that we are witnessing. It is generously framed by a huge amount of false information, just lies and fakes."" State Department officials told reporters Sunday that the decision to reduce staffing at the embassy was not due to any change in threat levels to US personnel in the country. The officials said the move to reduce embassy personnel and urge Americans in the country to leave was in part because State Department assistance would be ""severely impacted"" if there is Russian military action in Ukraine. The Marine Corps has bolstered security at the US Embassy, according to a senior Marine Corps official. The additional Marines came from the Marine Security Guard Security Augmentation Unit and were deployed ""recently,"" said the official, who would not specify exactly when they had arrived or how many had been sent. According to Defense Department workforce data, 30 Marines were based in Ukraine as of September 30. Most, if not all, of them would be handling embassy security, a Marine Corps mission. The other services have only a total of 14 members based in Ukraine. About 150 members of the Florida National Guard are deployed in Ukraine to assist in training the country's military forces. The Pentagon has also said that US Special Operations Command Europe has a ""large"" role in training Ukrainian special forces, though officials would not disclose how many special forces are in Ukraine. Those troops are not based in Ukraine but temporarily deployed there to assist in training. In addition to the US reducing staffing at its embassy in Kyiv, the UK Foreign Office also announced Monday that some British Embassy staff and dependents were being withdrawn in response to growing threats from Russia. The US is continuing to engage diplomatically with Russia, but recent talks have failed to bring about any breakthroughs. Russia has said that the US and NATO must commit to never admitting Ukraine into NATO and pull back military deployments from Eastern European counties, including Romania and Bulgaria. The US has said repeatedly these demands are a non-starter, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week the US would respond in writing to Moscow's demands following his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

2022-01-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-russia-republicans/index.html,Biden cranks up pressure as Putin mulls Ukraine invasion,"President Joe Biden and Western allies are signaling a stiffened stance in the showdown with Russia, piling on pressure designed to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine in a strategy that nevertheless risks quickening a dangerous cycle of escalation. The White House pivot comes with Biden now under searing pressure from Republicans to show more strength in the confrontation and follows a week in which he was heavily criticized for hastily walked-back comments that played into the Russian leader's hopes of dividing NATO. Several Republicans accused the President of showing weakness and appeasing Putin in talk show appearances on Sunday. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck a jarring tone by describing the Kremlin strongman as a ""very talented statesman"" who knew how to use power. GOP critiques of Biden ignored the party's tolerance of ex-President Donald Trump's craven deference to the Russian leader and some came across as an attempt to use a national security crisis to damage Biden politically ahead of midterm elections in 2022 and the 2024 presidential election. A series of moves, comments and signals from Washington and Europe over the weekend underscored the deepening peril of the situation at a time when there appears little meaningful diplomatic activity to stop its rapid deterioration. The State Department said Sunday it was authorizing the departure of non-essential staff and family members from its embassy in Kyiv and warned that in the event of a Russian invasion its capacity to help Americans in the country would be limited. In another significant development, administration officials said the President had discussed options that include deploying between 1,000 and 5,000 troops plus aircraft and ships to US allies in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe. NATO said early Monday that several member states, including France, Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands were either sending or considering small deployments of ships and aircraft to the Baltic and eastern European states. The mostly symbolic maneuvers appear calibrated to send a signal of resolve to Putin while avoiding the impression of a larger-scale mobilization that could send tensions spiraling out of control. ""We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defense,"" alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. On CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that if a single Russian unit entered Ukraine it ""would trigger a swift, a severe and a united response"" from the US and Europe. Britain, meanwhile, warned that it had intelligence that Putin was trying to install a puppet leader in place of the democratically elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And the head of Germany's navy was forced to resign after comments sympathetic to Russia in a drama that suggested an effort to cover-up deep divisions within the West about how to handle Putin. A potential US tactical shift Until now, the US has concentrated on sketching the dire consequences, in the form of debilitating sanctions, that it says would effectively cut Russia off from the Western economy in the event of an invasion. But the latest tactical decisions darkened an already foreboding atmosphere after Biden said last week that he believed that the decision on whether to invade Ukraine was Putin's dilemma alone. Talk of deploying troops also came across as a direct challenge to the Russian leader while at the same time being apparently designed to protect Biden's political flank at home. While the State Department said that it was acting out of an abundance of caution, drawing down embassy staffing is also a classic act of diplomatic symbolism that denotes a worsening crisis. Officials said any move to reinforce NATO flanks would be intended to ""provide deterrence and reassurance to allies."" It was not immediately clear whether deployments would come before or after any Russian invasion of Ukraine. But even talking about such steps puts Putin on notice that the entire premise of his hostage hold on Ukraine -- to force NATO to withdraw forces from ex-Soviet states -- would backfire. Yet the increasingly robust Western gambit is also a risk. It could convince Putin that he is right to warn that Russian security is threatened by the West. At the very least it could give him a propaganda pretext to invade Ukraine. And Biden must consider whether high-profile troop deployments before an invasion that the US says could come at any time could make it even harder for Putin to back down without securing a tangible payoff for his troop buildup. The latest US signals came after Russia amassed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders and initiated a new deployment of forces to Belarus, further surrounding its former Soviet client state, and after the government in Kyiv said that Moscow would soon have enough forces for a full-scale invasion. But Biden's latest steps will not satisfy Republicans who have demanded a much more aggressive US mobilization and are using the crisis to portray Biden as a feckless leader. Top Republican: 'Weakness invites aggression' Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Sunday urged the White House to use sanctions against Russia before any invasion as requested by the government of Ukraine. ""If we don't do something strong right now, I'm afraid that he's going to invade Ukraine, which will have global ramifications here,"" the Texas Republican said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" But Blinken rejected such an approach, warning that it would diminish the chances that concerns about consequences could influence Putin's decision. ""When it comes to sanctions, the purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression,"" Blinken said on ""State of the Union."" ""And so, if they're triggered now, you lose the deterrent effect."" McCaul also laid into Biden over the administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer, saying that it had convinced the Russian leader that the United States would not stand up for its interests. ""I think this all started ... with Afghanistan, and the unconditional surrender to the Taliban when he saw weakness. Weakness invited aggression,"" McCaul said on CBS. ""We're seen as weak right now ... because of President Biden."" (The administration argues the evacuation from Afghanistan was a huge success, but the initial debacle shocked US allies, left some to question the US' global commitment and helped hammer the President's approval ratings). The administration counters GOP criticism by saying that an agreement the Trump administration reached with the Taliban gave it no choice but to leave the country. Pompeo insisted on Fox that the previous administration had won Putin's respect by being strong, the result being that he ""didn't use coercive activity to try to push back on NATO."" It's true that some members of the Western alliance did increase military spending after Trump's complaints about the US being ripped off by its allies -- though perceptions of a rising Russian threat and his antipathy to the idea of defending allies also contributed. And the ex-President did allow lethal US aid to be sent to Ukraine, unlike former President Barack Obama. But his desire for Putin's approval often seemed to undermine his own administration's policy. His withdrawal from Syria, constant berating of NATO allies and denial of Russian election meddling advanced Putin's foreign policy goals. Pompeo: We should 'respect' Putin But Pompeo also offered gushing praise of the Russian leader's intellect that seemed tonally odd given that he's a US adversary currently threatening an armed takeover of a democracy supported by Washington. ""We had respect for him and his power. He's a very talented statesman,"" Pompeo said on Fox. ""He has lots of gifts. He was a KGB agent, for goodness' sakes. He knows how to use power, we should respect that."" The idea that the United States should respect a leader who rules with an iron fist, who crushed democracy and freedom of the press, imprisons political opponents and presides over a corrupt economy that empowers oligarchs is notable coming from an ex-secretary of state. Foreign policy experts often divide on the question of whether Putin is playing a tough hand with aplomb or whether his international gangsterism is more the act of a weak leader terrified of legitimate opposition and being forced from power. It's also questionable whether massing troops on the border of a vulnerable democracy and making outlandish demands of NATO is the behavior of a ""talented statesman."" And any arguments that Putin was cowed by Trump from using coercion against the West are confounded by US intelligence assessments that Moscow interfered in US elections. The then-President stunned the US espionage community by disowning assessments of Putin's 2016 meddling when he appeared side-by-side with him at a press conference in Helsinki. Cyberattacks emanating from Russian soil also took place throughout the Trump presidency, including the SolarWinds operation that breached US federal agencies when the former President was in power. Supposed respect for the US didn't stop Russian agents using a biological weapon on British soil to poison a defector, according to the UK government. The willingness of the GOP to criticize Biden, despite these huge blemishes on Trump's record, shows that for many of its members, with a few exceptions like McCaul, politics take priority over national security in the pursuit of future power. Such an approach only widens the divides on which Putin relies as he seeks to tarnish American prestige.",4,3.935448025002101,2.8497750492669054,1.0856729757351955,22
2022-01-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/politics/russia-cyberattack-warning-homeland-security/index.html,DHS warns of potential Russia cyberattacks amid tensions,"Russia would consider conducting a cyberattack on the US homeland if Moscow perceived that a US or NATO response to a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine ""threatened [Russia's] long-term national security,"" according to a Department of Homeland Security intelligence bulletin obtained by CNN. ""Russia maintains a range of offensive cyber tools that it could employ against US networks—from low-level denials-of-service to destructive attacks targeting critical infrastructure,"" says the January 23 memo, which DHS distributed to critical infrastructure operators and state and local governments. Despite US tensions with Russia over Ukraine, DHS analysts assess that Moscow's threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive cyberattacks on the US homeland ""probably remains very high,"" the memo says. ""[W]e have not observed Moscow directly employ these types of cyber attacks against US critical infrastructure—notwithstanding cyber espionage and potential prepositioning operations in the past."" Asked for comment, a DHS spokesperson said, ""The Department of Homeland Security regularly shares information with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial officials to ensure the safety and security of all communities across the country."" US officials have been bracing for potential retaliatory cyberattacks from the Kremlin as Russia has threatened to invade Ukraine by amassing some 100,000 troops along the Ukraine border. The Treasury Department held a classified briefing that covered the issue for big US banks, while the Energy Department has briefed America's largest electric utilities on Russian cyber capabilities, CNN previously reported. Ukraine 'a sort of testing ground' for cyberattacks Cyber operations have been a recurring aspect of the military conflict in Ukraine, analysts say, which began when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Suspected Russian hackers cut power in parts of Ukraine in 2015 and 2016, and unleashed devastating malware known as NotPetya in 2017 that began infecting organizations in Ukraine but spread globally, causing billions of dollars in damage. The US Justice Department blamed all three incidents on Russia's GRU military intelligence agency. ""I am concerned that Russia has been using Ukraine as a sort of testing ground for its cyber capabilities,"" Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN. ""For years, I've been making the case that we need rules of the road in cyberspace, just like we have defined norms around armed conflict,"" Warner said. ""We need to ensure that the Kremlin knows that if they were to use destructive cyberattacks against the United States, there would be serious consequences."" The Biden administration has repeatedly tried to impose costs in response to Russian hacking activity, including by sanctioning Russian technology firms. President Joe Biden said at a press conference last week that the US could respond with cyberoperations of its own should Russia conduct additional cyberattacks in Ukraine. Biden spoke days after a pair of cyberattacks targeted several Ukrainian government agencies that investigators believe were carried out by the same actor. In some cases, the hackers replaced content on government websites with threatening messages claiming Ukrainians' data had been stolen. In other cases, malicious software deleted data from roughly 20 computer servers and workstations at at least two Ukrainian government agencies, according to Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian official investigating the incident. The impact of the hacks has so far been limited, but Ukraine's recent history has officials on alert. ""One possibility ... is that this attack is just a front for a much stronger attack that we may face in the future,"" Serhiy Demedyuk, deputy secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told CNN. Ukraine preparing cyberdefenses As Ukraine readies its military to defend against a potential Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have held urgent cybersecurity meetings and drawn on US support to fortify their networks. Zhora told CNN that officials at the US Embassy in Kyiv were quick to offer help in recovering from the hacks. There is ""no doubt that [any Russian invasion] can be supported by cyber aggression — or at least they will stay active in cyberspace,"" said Zhora, who is a deputy chairman at Ukraine's State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection. It's unclear, for now, who was responsible for the recent website defacements and the small amount of data-wiping on Ukrainian government networks. Some of the tactics used are similar to those of Russian hackers, Zhora and Demedyuk said in separate interviews, but the evidence so far is inconclusive. Demedyuk has also suggested that a hacking group linked with Belarus intelligence could be involved, but he told CNN that theory is unproven as of now. ""The sheer amount of digital evidence involved in this attack has made it more difficult to pin down which group is responsible."" One immediate focus is on ensuring that the intruders have been kicked out of Ukrainian networks so they can't do more damage. ""We need to be sure [of that],"" Zhora said from his office in Kyiv.

Russian naval exercises are due to take place in early February, approximately 240 kilometers (149 miles) off Ireland's southwest coast, Simon Coveney said in a statement late Sunday. The area is in Ireland's EEZ but not its territorial waters. Under international law, states are entitled to carry out naval exercises in another state's EEZ, Coveney said. He said the Irish Aviation Authority had been informed of the exercise via standard procedures. ""In light of the current political and security environment in Europe, the Department of Foreign Affairs has raised a number of concerns with the Russian authorities in respect of these exercises,"" Coveney added. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with a Russian troop buildup near the border spurring fears Moscow could soon launch an invasion. The Kremlin has denied it is planning to attack, arguing NATO support for Ukraine constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. NATO allies are putting forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter jets to eastern Europe, the organization said Monday. Meanwhile, the US State Department announced Sunday evening it would reduce staff levels at the US Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, beginning with the departure of nonessential staff and family members. On his way into the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on Monday, Coveney told reporters that he will brief his EU counterparts on Russia's plans to conduct the naval exercises. Although the area is part of Ireland's EEZ, it is in international waters, meaning Ireland doesn't ""have a power to prevent this happening,"" the Foreign Minister remarked. ""I've made it clear to the Russian ambassador in Ireland that it's not welcome. This isn't the time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what's happening with and in Ukraine at the moment,"" Coveney emphasized. ""The fact that they're choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, off the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that, in our view is simply not welcome and not wanted right now, particularly in the coming weeks,"" he said. EU foreign ministers want to send a clear message to Russia that if it decides to invade Ukraine it will be hit by the ""most comprehensive"" package of sanctions and restrictions ever prepared by the EU, Coveney said. US officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two.

2022-01-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/europe/nato-deployment-eastern-europe-ukraine-intl/index.html,NATO allies put forces on standby as tensions rise over Ukraine crisis,"NATO announced on Monday that some member countries are putting forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter jets to eastern Europe as the United Kingdom and the United States ordered diplomats' families to withdraw from Ukraine amid concerns of a Russian invasion. The developments underscore growing fears of a possible Russian incursion, following months of military maneuvering by Moscow that has set off a tit-for-tat series of escalations with NATO, a military alliance of Western powers. Russia has been building up forces and equipment near its border with Ukraine since last year, and is sending troops into neighboring Belarus for joint exercises next month that Ukrainian officials fear could serve as a ""full-fledged theater of operations"" from which to launch an attack. US intelligence officials have said they don't know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning to do so, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. After high-level talks between Moscow and Washington wrapped earlier this month without any breakthroughs over the tens of thousands of Russian troops amassed on Ukraine's border, prospects of de-escalation and future diplomacy have been cast into doubt. Now the Biden administration is weighing whether to deploy as many as 5,000 US troops, according to a senior defense official, to shore up NATO allies in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. On Monday, both NATO and Russia pointed the finger at each other for the ratcheting tensions. ""Tensions are escalating due to concrete actions taken by the US and NATO,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, referring to NATO's announcement. ""I mean the informational hysteria that we are witnessing -- it is generously framed by a huge amount of false information, just lies and fakes,"" Peskov added. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a Monday statement that the alliance would continue to take necessary measures ""to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance."" He added: ""We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence."" The NATO statement said that in recent days, a flurry of member states had announced deployments to the region. They include Denmark sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 fighter jets to Lithuania, the Netherlands deploying two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria, France expressing its readiness to send troops to Romania and the US considering increasing its military presence in the East. Stoltenberg cautioned in a news conference on Monday that the moves were defensive and proportionate -- and that NATO was ""not threatening Russia."" There was no suggestion in the statement that the troops would be used to assist Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. NATO, Europe and the US have been united in their opposition to any further Russian incursion in Ukraine, promising to lend support to Ukraine and hand down ""massive costs"" for Moscow in the event they make a move. But the shape of that response and what steps they might take are still unclear. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday warned that ""a single additional Russian force"" entering Ukraine ""in an aggressive way"" would result in a severe response by the US and its allies. His comments came after US President Joe Biden muddled the message of severe consequences last week, saying at a news conference that a ""minor incursion"" might not trigger the same response from NATO as an invasion. The President later clarified that any Russian troops crossing Ukraine's border would constitute an invasion. CNN reported last week that the US military goal would be to ""meet the capability"" NATO allies in the region are asking for, a defense official said. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that as many as 8,500 US troops have been put on heightened preparedness to deploy. The mobilization of Western forces comes amid a significant uptick in Russia's military movements, not only on Ukraine's border -- where the Ukrainian Defense Ministry says there are now 127,000 Russian troops stationed -- but elsewhere in Europe. The Russian Defense Ministry announced last week that 140 ships and 10,000 servicemen would take part in sweeping exercises from the Pacific to the Atlantic, including off Ireland's southwest coast in February. The ministry said the main purpose of the drills is to protect Russia's national interests in the world's oceans, TASS state news agency reported. Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told reporters on Monday that he had raised concerns with Moscow about Russia's plans. ""This isn't the time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what's happening with and in Ukraine at the moment,"" Coveney said. Coveney and other European Union foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss the security situation in Ukraine and what action to take should Russia cross into Ukrainian territory; Blinken joined by video link following talks with Lavrov in Geneva. EU foreign ministers want to send a clear message to Russia that if it decides to invade Ukraine it will be hit by the ""most comprehensive"" package of sanctions and restrictions ever prepared by the EU, Coveney said. But while NATO countries ramp up readiness and the EU discusses heightened security concerns, Ukraine's own government has not, at least outwardly, signaled the same sense of urgency. In a call with the President of the European Council Charles Michel on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country will not succumb to provocations, but would ""keep calm."" Zelensky and his government have previously downplayed the danger of a Russian invasion, noting that the threat has existed for years and has not become greater in recent months. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia has been rumbling since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a rebellion in Ukraine's east. Despite a cease fire in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace. Ukraine on Monday criticized the US' decision to withdraw diplomats' families and reduce staff levels at the US Embassy in Kyiv, with Oleg Nikolenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, saying in a tweet: ""We believe such a step to be a premature one & an instance of excessive caution."" But other countries are also taking precautions in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. The UK Foreign Office also announced Monday that some British Embassy staff and dependents were being withdrawn from Kyiv in response to ""growing threats from Russia."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that the intelligence around the situation in Ukraine was ""gloomy"" but that war was not inevitable. Speaking to reporters at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday, the bloc's chief diplomat Josep Borrell said Europe will seek to simmer tensions between Russia and Ukraine through diplomacy first but warned Moscow it is prepared to take action if necessary. He also urged for calm, stressing the need to avoid ""alarmist reactions that could that could lead to an escalation. We don't want people to have a breakdown on this.""

US officials still don't know what Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans are or whether he has even decided to invade. But some officials who have seen the intelligence say there is evidence that Russia is planning to try to take Kyiv and overthrow the government, as CNN has previously reported. The UK foreign office said in a statement on Saturday that it has information the Russian government is planning to ""install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv as it considers whether to invade and occupy Ukraine."" US believes Putin 'could invade at any time' ""It is the totality of the situation that we have been watching and the decision based on this military buildup, based on how we see these developments,"" a State Department official on a call with reporters said while explaining why this step was taken now. ""As President Biden has said, military action by Russia could come at any time,"" the official said. ""If Russia chooses further escalation, then the security conditions, particularly along Ukraine's borders, in Russia-occupied Crimea, in Russian controlled eastern Ukraine, are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice. We are taking this action now because of Russia's aggressive actions towards Ukraine."" The official would not comment on specific intelligence reports when asked about the UK government claim that it has information that the Russian government is planning to ""install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv as it considers whether to invade and occupy Ukraine."" But the official added that the US has been very clear about Russia's ""attempts to destabilize Ukraine internally"" and that these actions are in Russia's playbook. Sunday's action triggered the voluntary departure of non-emergency US government employees, and the department has ordered the departure of family members of US government employees at the US embassy. Essential US embassy personnel will remain in the country, though the department would not say how many officials that amounts to. The US embassy will continue operating ""uninterrupted,"" the official said. The official explained that State Department assistance to US citizens in Ukraine will be ""severely impacted"" if there is Russian military action in the country. ""We want US citizens in Ukraine to be aware, for their planning purposes, that Russian military action anywhere in Ukraine was severely impacted US embassy's ability to provide consular services, including assistance to US citizens in departing Ukraine,"" the official said. ""Our travel advisory update asks all US citizens in Ukraine to complete an online form so that we may better communicate with them. This is especially important if they plan to remain in Ukraine."" Americans are encouraged to register with State Department when they travel abroad but they are not required to register. As a result, the department said that sharing the information they have would not be useful. The officials would not say approximately how many US citizens are in Ukraine now. The State Department travel advisory for Ukraine remains at level 4, which means do not travel.

""If a single additional Russian force goes into Ukraine in an aggressive way, as I said, that would trigger a swift, a severe and a united response from us and from Europe,"" Blinken told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. The comments from the secretary further clarify the US' position on any additional aggressive military action by Russia after the country amassed tens of thousands of troops on its border with Ukraine. Though US officials have been issuing warnings to Russia in recent days, President Joe Biden muddled the message of severe consequences last week, saying at a news conference that a ""minor incursion"" might not trigger the same response from NATO as an invasion. The President later clarified that any Russian troops crossing Ukraine's border would constitute an invasion, and Blinken, following a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week, also warned that any Russian invasion of Ukraine would be ""met with a severe and a united response."" Blinken on Sunday also defended the administration's unwillingness to impose sanctions against Russia preemptively, despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urging the US and its allies to penalize Moscow now for its massive troop buildup along Ukraine's borders. ""When it comes to sanctions, the purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression,"" he said. ""So if they're triggered now, you lose the deterrent effect. All of the things that we're doing, including building up in a united way with Europe, massive consequences for Russia, is designed to factor into President (Vladimir) Putin's calculus and to deter and dissuade them from taking aggressive action, even as we pursue diplomacy at the same time."" Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa said in a separate interview on ""State of the Union"" Sunday that the Biden administration should impose a new round of sanctions on Russian officials immediately to deter an invasion of Ukraine. ""We do need to go ahead and impose sanctions on Russia now. We need to show them that we mean business and we will be there for Ukraine should (Russia) invade,"" Ernst, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Bash. ""Once an invasion happens? Lives are lost. You can't go back from that. So those sanctions need to be put in place now."" The top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee echoed Ernst's sentiments on Sunday, saying that without US sanctions, Putin will invade Ukraine. ""If we don't do something strong right now, I'm afraid that he's going to invade Ukraine, which will have ... global ramifications here,"" Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas told CBS News. ""This President has made so many concessions with nothing in return,"" he added. ""That's why Putin smells weakness. He's wanted this, as you and I talked about, for a long time. It's his legacy issue. And if we don't provide that deterrence, he will go in."" Last week, Biden vowed withering economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the frontier, including restricting its financial transactions in US dollars. The President said that after speaking with Putin twice last month, he believed his Russian counterpart had a good understanding of the economic sanctions he was preparing to enact.

2022-01-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/23/europe/german-navy-chief-resignation-intl/index.html,German navy chief resigns after suggesting Putin 'deserved respect',"The chief of German navy has resigned after suggesting that Crimea would ""never come back"" to Ukraine, a statement that is in direct contradiction to the stance taken by the German government, the European Union and NATO. Vice-Admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach said he asked the German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht to relieve him of his duties ""effective immediately."" His resignation on Saturday came at the time of extreme tension between Russia and the West over recent buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border. Schönbach got into hot water over several remarks that included a suggestion that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""probably"" deserved respect. A video of his talk at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, a think tank, was posted on YouTube on Friday. In it, the Vice-Admiral is heard as saying: ""Is Russia really interested in ... a small, tiny strip of Ukraine's soil? No, this is nonsense."" ""What he really wants is respect. And my God, giving someone respect is low cost, even no cost ... so if I was asked, it is easy to even give him the respect he really demands, and probably also deserves,"" he said, adding: ""Russia is an old country. Russia is an important country. Even we, India, Germany, we need Russia, because we need Russia against China."" The remarks sparked criticism in Germany and abroad. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs has summoned the German ambassador to Ukraine over the comments, saying it ""strongly rejected"" Schönbach's statements on Crimea never returning to Ukraine. Schönbach said that the comments he made during the talk reflected his personal opinion ""at that moment"" and that ""they correspond in no way with the official position of the ministry of defense."" However, he said the remarks were ""increasingly weighing on my office"" and therefore he decided to resign. Schönbach took over as the chief of navy, officially known as the Inspector of the Navy, in March last year, after more than 35 years in the navy. He served as the commanding officer of NATO Maritime Group 2, NATO's standing maritime immediate reaction force. Meanwhile, as Russia amasses troops on the Ukrainian border, the Ukraine government has been asking NATO countries for help. While the US, UK and several other NATO countries shipped weapons to Ukraine, Germany has so far refused to do so. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told journalists earlier this week that Germany often restricted the export of weapons to crisis areas. ""Germany has a special tradition of showed great restraint when it comes to exporting weapons and arms to crisis areas,"" she said. ""We have tried to assume responsibility in different ways. We, for example, have helped expand the military hospital.""",4,3.8450729254418263,2.5792564570728245,1.2658164683690019,6

The goal of any military reinforcement in Eastern Europe would be to provide deterrence and reassurance to allies. The options could include ""movement of assets and forces already in Europe and also assets and forces available outside of Europe,"" the official said. A Russian invasion ""certainly would be one trigger"" for US troops and assets to move. But some forces might be used in exercises and other training scenarios as well. Broadly, the US military goal would be to ""meet the capability"" that NATO allies in the region are asking for, the official said.

""The former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev is being considered as a potential candidate,"" the British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said. Murayev told CNN Saturday ""there is nothing to comment on"" regarding the allegations, as he is a Ukrainian national and still facing Russian sanctions. The statement went on to name four other former Ukrainian officials, saying, ""We have information that the Russian intelligence services maintain links with numerous former Ukrainian politicians"" including Serhiy Arbuzov, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine from 2012 to 2014, and acting Prime Minister in 2014; Andriy Kluyev, First Deputy Prime Minister from 2010 to 2012 and Chief of Staff to former Ukrainian President Yanukovich, Vladimir Sivkovich, former Deputy Head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council (RNBO); Mykola Azarov, Prime Minister of Ukraine from 2010-2014, it said. ""Some of these have contact with Russian intelligence officers currently involved in the planning for an attack on Ukraine,"" the British foreign office statement added. Russia has denied allegations it is planning to attack Ukraine. CNN has reached out to Azarov for comment but has not received a response. CNN has been unable to reach Kluyev and Arbuzov, and local media reports suggest the two former Ukrainian politicians are avoiding media attention. According to Ukrainian state media, Arbuzov is living in Russia. Meanwhile, Kluyev's whereabouts are unknown and he has been declared wanted in Ukraine, according to state media. CNN has also been unable to reach Sivkovich. Early Sunday, Russia's foreign ministry urged the UK's foreign office to ""stop engaging in provocations,"" state news agency TASS reported. ""The misinformation spread by the British Foreign Office is another evidence that these are the NATO countries, led by the Anglo-Saxons, that are escalating tensions around Ukraine. We call on the British Foreign Office to stop provocative activities, stop spreading nonsense and focus on studying the history of the Tatar-Mongol yoke,"" a representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry told TASS. CNN reached out to the UK foreign office on Saturday for further comment on its claims, as well as supporting evidence, but it said it would not comment any further. ""The information being released today shines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin thinking,"" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement. ""Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy,"" Truss said. ""As the UK and our partners have said repeatedly, any Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs."" On Twitter, Truss said: ""We will not tolerate (a) Kremlin plot to install pro-Russian leadership in Ukraine."" British deputy prime minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday that Russia will face severe economic sanctions if it installs its own regime in Ukraine. ""We are standing shoulder to shoulder, saying there will be very serious consequences in Russia takes this move to try and invade, but also install a puppet regime,"" Raab told Sky News on Sunday. CNN also reached out to the US State Department and the White House for comment. Source: US has 'same information' as UK In a statement Saturday, the White House said President Joe Biden met with his national security team to discuss ""continued Russian aggressive actions toward Ukraine."" The President was briefed on the state of Russian military operations on Ukraine's borders and ""discussed both our ongoing efforts to de-escalate the situation with diplomacy and our range of deterrence measures that are being coordinated closely with our Allies and partners, including ongoing deliveries of security assistance to Ukraine,"" it added. ""President Biden again affirmed that should Russia further invade Ukraine, the United States will impose swift and severe consequences on Russia with our Allies and partners,"" the White House said. A source briefed on the US and British intelligence confirmed the US has similar evidence as the UK, regarding Russia's plot to install a friendly government in Ukraine. ""Yes, we have seen the intelligence that Russia is looking at ways to minimize a long, drawn out war. That includes things like installing a friendly government and using its spy agencies to foment dissent,"" the source said. Another source briefed said the US ""has the same information."" Russia has previously been accused of attempting to sow chaos in Ukraine through cyberattacks and, purportedly, plotting to take control of the government in Kyiv. But the Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning to invade. CNN previously reported the US accused Russia of recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to attempt to take control of Ukraine's government as it unveiled new sanctions on Thursday. The Treasury Department rolled out sanctions against four current and former Ukrainian officials it said were involved in Kremlin-directed influence activities to destabilize Ukraine. Those newly sanctioned individuals include Taras Romanovych Kozak, Volodymyr Mykolayovych Oliynyk, Vladimir Leonidovich Sivkovich, and Oleh Voloshyn. Sivkovich was the only former Ukrainian politician named in both the US and UK announcements. The Treasury said the four individuals -- two of whom are current members of Ukraine's Parliament --- were acting under the direction of a Russian intelligence service sanctioned by the US and played ""various roles"" in Russia's ""global influence campaign to destabilize sovereign countries in support of the Kremlin's political objectives."" US National Security Council Spokesperson Emily Horne expressed solidarity with Ukraine as the UK Foreign Office said it had information the Russian government is planning to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine, calling the plot ""deeply concerning."" ""This kind of plotting is deeply concerning,"" Horne said. ""The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine."" Romania, Bulgaria slam Russia's demands to move NATO troops That comes as NATO members Romania and Bulgaria slammed Russia's demand to remove alliance troops from both countries as ""unacceptable,"" with each arguing that the Kremlin has no right to interfere in the foreign policy decisions of other sovereign states. The comments from both countries came just hours after Russia's Foreign Ministry confirmed its demand for NATO to pull back troops from parts of eastern Europe included Bulgaria and Romania. The two countries are located on the Black Sea, which analysts believe Moscow sees as an important geostrategic buffer zone between itself and Europe. Romania's Ministry of Foreign affairs said in a statement Saturday ""such a demand is unacceptable and cannot be negotiated."" Bulgaria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged Moscow to ""to show respect to the foreign policy choice consciously made by Bulgaria."" Bulgaria's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Marin Raykov, told the BBC the Kremlin's demand is ""an expression of contempt for the sovereign rights of Bulgaria to choose the sources of guarantees for national security."" Russia and NATO have been at loggerheads since late last year, when the Kremlin deployed an estimated 100,000 troops to its border with Ukraine. That military posturing has prompted fears that Russia is planning another incursion into Ukraine after invading and illegally annexing the Crimean peninsula in 2014. That same year, Moscow began supporting a pro-Russian separatist movement in eastern Ukraine that's left thousands dead. In its statement, Romania said the NATO military presence in eastern Europe is ""a strictly defensive reaction to the increasingly aggressive behavior of the Russian Federation ... which started in 2014. when the Ukrainian territory Crimea was illegally occupied by Russia."" ""This behavior continues to intensify in the present, despite NATO's attempts to engage in constructive dialogue,"" the statement read. The United States and its NATO allies have repeatedly warned Russia any movement of its troops into Ukranian territory would be met with what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called ""a severe and a united response."" Russian President Vladimir Putin has argued in recent weeks that his country is the aggrieved party, and is responding to NATO's cooperation with Ukraine and the alliance's eastward expansion since the fall of the Soviet Union -- which Russia views as an existential security threat. Diplomats from all sides have been attempting to negotiate a peaceful settlement, though one of Russia's core demands -- that NATO withdraw foreign military forces and equipment from members of the alliance who joined after 1997 -- was quickly deemed a non-starter by Western diplomats. ""NATO allies are ready to engage in dialogue with Russia, but we will not compromise on core principles,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier this month. ""We will not compromise on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every nation in Europe, and we will not compromise on the right for all countries to do, to choose their own path, including what kind of security arrangements they want to be part of, and will not compromise on the right for allies to protect and defend each other."" Weaponry sent to Ukraine NATO members have, in recent days, deployed military equipment and personnel to eastern alliance members in response to Russia's troop buildup in Ukraine. The Dutch Defense Minister said the Netherlands would deploy two F-35 jets, along with support staff, to Bulgaria in April or May, while the Spanish Defense Minister offered to send fighter jets and a warship to the Black Sea. The alliance has also begun sending weaponry to Kyiv to deter a potential Russian invasion and strengthen Ukraine's defensive capabilities. Light anti-tank weapons from the United Kingdom have already arrived in the country, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Tuesday, while the Czech Republic plans donate 152-milimeter caliber artillery ammunition to Ukraine in the coming days, Czech Defense Minister Jana Černochová said Friday. Germany will supply a fully equipped field hospital to Ukraine, according to the German Defense Ministry. The country has traditionally avoided exporting arms to crisis areas since World War II, but German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said earlier this week that ""all measures"" will be on the table if there is further Russian aggression against Ukraine.

2022-01-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/22/politics/russia-ukraine-us-what-matters/index.html,Why Russia's Ukraine aggression matters to Americans,"Nobody knows for sure exactly what Vladimir Putin is doing with around 100,000 Russian troops parked near the Russia-Ukraine border, but it's making the US and Europe extremely nervous. President Joe Biden said this week he expected the Russians would ""move in"" and that a slight incursion would be met differently than a full-on invasion. The US has spent the past few days cleaning up that remark and making clear any type of invasion is unacceptable. Asked in Geneva by a reporter if he thought, like Biden, that an invasion was likely, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov used some interesting language. ""Unless the United States doesn't go to bed with Ukraine, I don't think so,"" Lavrov said. What does it mean for countries to 'go to bed'? All of this high-stakes geopolitical chess, then, comes down to how intimate the US gets with Ukraine in the eyes of Russia. After meeting with Lavrov in Geneva, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated there would be steep consequences for an invasion, but also that the two countries are still talking. The US will provide a written response to Russia's concerns within the next week. Putin's desire to somehow reconstitute the power of the Soviet Union is no secret. Spreading Russian power further into Ukraine would be a logical step and a direct challenge to Western democracies. Putin will require something. Former US Secretary of Defense William Cohen told CNN's Kate Bolduan Friday that Putin is not a ""Hamlet-like character"" trying to decide what to do. Everything is calculated and intentional. ""He's going to get something out of this that satisfies him, that he's made his point that Ukraine can never become truly independent, cannot become a member of NATO and cannot have any kind of offensive arms,"" Cohen said. Those are demands, he said, the US cannot meet. The backstory. Some points of context from this excellent report from inside Ukraine by CNN's Matthew Chance and Laura Smith-Spark: Russia already annexed a portion of Ukraine, Crimea, in 2014. Russian-backed separatists took over the Donbas portion of the country that same year, and clashes and sniper attacks continue there. Putin feels threatened by NATO and feels that NATO support for Ukraine is a ""red line."" Ukraine fears a preplanned coup to topple its government could be part of an invasion plan. One way to mollify Putin may be for Biden and European leaders to promise not to bring Ukraine into the NATO fold. Ukraine, which is not part of NATO, would like to keep its options open. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN, in response to Russian calls for NATO to halt its eastward expansion. NATO has grown since the fall of the Soviet Union, adding numerous countries that were formerly part of the Soviet bloc. These include the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; and North Macedonia 2020. 'Assume the worst.' When CNN's John King played Lavrov's comment about the US going to bed with Ukraine for another former Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, he said the first thing is to be skeptical of the Russian leaders. ""I begin on the premise that you don't trust what Lavrov or Putin say,"" Panetta said. ""I don't think we can assume that just because Lavrov says that Russia is not going to invade that that's the case, so I just think we have to assume the worst at this point."" Remember, they're adversaries. Panetta went on to argue that Americans should view the Russian leaders as trying to undermine the US and NATO. ""These are adversaries,"" Panetta said. ""Their whole intent is to basically weaken the United States, weaken the alliance and undermine our democracy, and I think it's very important for the US and our allies to be very strong about the kind of response that will take place if they invade."" Emphasis on deterrence. There is no indication at all the US would send combat troops to Ukraine. It is, after all, not a party to NATO. There are small numbers of National Guard and Special Operations troops in Ukraine as trainers. And the US gave Ukraine roughly $450 million worth of military aid in 2021 and is weighing how to help prop up the Ukrainian military. Panetta said it's not a foregone conclusion that Russia invades Ukraine, and there is an opportunity to deter Putin, particularly with military signaling. The Biden administration has authorized Baltic states to send US-manufactured military hardware to Ukraine. While Russia is currently under economic sanctions, more biting efforts to cut Russia off from the Western economy could also be used as deterrents. These could include restricting Russia's access to the US dollar and squashing its effort with Germany to build a national gas pipeline around Ukraine and directly into Europe. The US and Europe are not on the same page when it comes to deterring Russia, something Biden made clear during his news conference this week. Invasion will hurt the US and Europe. Everyday Americans would feel the effects of an invasion in their bank accounts. Gas prices could soar, writes CNN's Matt Egan. ""It's impossible to say how high prices would go — and how long they would stay high. But $100 oil would surely lift prices at the pump. And that means a Russia-Ukraine conflict has the potential to impact most Americans."" The status of Western democracies. There is something more than the economy, however. Biden has built his presidency around the idea that democratic countries must stand up to autocratic regimes. As CNN's Stephen Collinson smartly writes, Putin ""is using Ukraine as a hostage to try to force the US to renegotiate the settled outcome of the Cold War."" Collinson also explains why Americans more concerned about the economy and the coronavirus pandemic should care about this ""most tense test of wills since the fall of the Soviet Union."" Nothing less than ""the biggest clash of regular conventional armies in Europe since World War II"" is at stake.",4,1.9808050673831503,2.6955643663272584,-0.7147592989441081,26

Blinken's meeting with Lavrov came two days after President Joe Biden muddled the US message of severe consequences for Russia, saying at a press conference that a ""minor incursion"" might not trigger the same response from NATO as an invasion. Biden clarified Thursday that any Russian troops crossing Ukraine's border would constitute an invasion. Blinken held a 90-minute bilateral meeting Friday in Geneva with Lavrov, in which the US sought to convince Russia to de-escalate the situation at the Ukrainian border where Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops. Blinken said that the meeting was ""not a negotiation,"" just like last week's talks between NATO and the West. ""We didn't expect any major breakthroughs to happen today, but I believe we are on a clearer path in terms of understanding each other's concerns, each others' positions,"" Blinken said at a press conference after the meeting. ""Let's see what the next days bring."" The Americans and Russians agreed to keep talking -- but on little else -- following the latest round of diplomatic talks. Blinken said that the US would provide Russia with a written response next week to the concerns that it had publicly released, something that Moscow has sought. ""I told him that following the consultations that we'll have in the coming days with allies and partners, we anticipate that we will be able to share with Russia our concerns and ideas in more detail and in writing next week, and we agreed to further discussions after that,"" Blinken told reporters following his sitdown with Lavrov. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the US planned to put in writing ""the serious concerns that we and other allies and partners have about Russia's actions, as well as ideas for how we might actually strengthen each other's sense of security going forward."" ""This is just a part of the diplomatic process and diplomatic negotiations,"" she said of the written responses. Ukraine fears eased but warn of delaying tactics A senior Ukrainian official warned that continuing US-Russian diplomacy could simply be a delaying tactic by Moscow to further prepare for a military offensive. The official told CNN's Matthew Chance that the US and Ukrainian leadership were closely coordinating on the diplomatic efforts, and that Ukrainian officials had been given a ""full debrief"" by Blinken following his meeting with Lavrov on Friday. The official said the US had stressed that there would be ""no concessions given to Russia on Ukraine,"" and that Ukraine would not be ""coerced to make any concessions"". Private and public assurances from the US that any Russian incursion -- even a minor one -- would trigger a harsh response has ""eased Ukrainian fears, to some extent,"" the official said. Blinken said that he once again reiterated Moscow's central demand -- that the US and NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine as a member -- is simply a non-starter. Moscow, however, reiterated Friday its insistence that NATO not only agree never to admit Ukraine but also the withdrawal of troops and forces back to NATO's 1997 borders, before several countries in Eastern Europe were admitted. The Russian foreign ministry specifically singled out Bulgaria and Romania, the latter of which shares Ukraine's southern border. ""We are talking about the withdrawal of foreign forces, hardware, and weapons as well as other steps that will ensure that the setup in the countries that were not NATO members back in 1997 would be reverted to what it was back then,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. ""These include Bulgaria and Romania."" US looking at boosting allies military options The Defense Department is working on a series of military options for Biden's approval that could be activated to beef up US military presence in eastern Europe as a deterrence if Russia invades Ukraine, according to two defense officials. ""We are exploring a wide range of options on how we would bolster our allies militarily,"" the first official said. These options would also likely be supported by sanctions. The goal of any military reinforcement in eastern Europe would be to provide deterrence and reassurance to allies. The options could include ""movement of assets and forces already in Europe and also assets and forces available outside of Europe,"" the official said. A Russian invasion ""certainly would be one trigger"" for US troops and assets to move. But some forces might be used in exercises and other training scenarios as well. Broadly, the US military goal would be to ""meet the capability"" NATO allies in the region are asking for, the official said. US forces could operate, as they already do, unilaterally in Europe, but could also operate under existing NATO command structures. Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border, and US officials have warned an attack could happen at any time. Biden said Wednesday he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin would invade Ukraine. The US has warned that it will impose severe consequences in the event of an invasion -- and Blinken reiterated Friday that meant Russian troops crossing the border. ""We've been clear. If any Russian military forces move across Ukraine's border, that's a renewed invasion. It will be met with swift, severe and a united response from the United States and our partners and allies,"" Blinken said. Lavrov, however, insisted Friday that Russia was not planning to attack. ""You claim that we are going to attack Ukraine, although we have repeatedly explained that this is not the case,"" Lavrov said when asked about a potential invasion by CNN Senior International Correspondent Frederik Pleitgen. Blinken said that the US was acting on the basis of ""facts and history,"" noting the Russian troops that have swelled on the border as well as Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea. He said that a ""charitable interpretation"" of their disagreements is that the US and Russia sometimes have ""different interpretations of history."" ""Today, we certainly heard things we strongly disagree with in terms of that history,"" Blinken said. Blinken's meeting with Lavrov on Friday followed his meetings in Berlin with his German, UK and French counterparts and Kyiv, where he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Biden's comments on Wednesday acknowledging disunity within NATO over how to respond to a ""minor incursion"" by Russia prompted outcry from stunned Ukrainian officials who warned the remarks were a green-light to Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted Thursday ""there are no minor incursions,"" in what amounted to an implicit rebuke of Biden.",4,1.1311425483752133,0.5943953755911857,0.5367471727840276,20
2022-01-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/zelensky-biden-ukraine-incursions/index.html,Ukrainian President pushes back on Biden: 'There are no minor incursions',"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly pushed back Thursday on US President Joe Biden's comments that a ""minor incursion"" by Russia into Ukraine would prompt a lesser response than a full-scale invasion, in an implicit rebuke of Biden's comments. ""We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter in an apparent response Biden's remarks on Wednesday. ""Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones."" Biden's comments at a news conference Wednesday about the prospect of Russian military action alarmed Ukrainian officials as Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops along the border. While US officials have engaged in multiple rounds of diplomatic talks with Russia in recent days -- and Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting with his Russian counterpart on Friday -- US officials have warned an attack could be imminent. In his comments Wednesday, Biden suggested that a ""minor incursion"" could prompt a disagreement among NATO countries about how strongly to respond to Moscow. ""It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et cetera,"" Biden said. ""If there is something that is where there's Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighters, et cetera, I think that changes everything,"" the President later said. ""But it depends on what he does, to what extent we'll get total unity on the NATO front."" On Thursday, Biden sought to clarify his earlier remarks, telling reporters at the White House, ""I've been absolutely clear with President Putin. He has no misunderstanding. If any -- any -- assembled Russian units move across Ukrainian border, that is an invasion,"" Biden said. ""But it will be met with severe and coordinated economic response that I've discussed in detail with our allies, as well as laid out very clearly for President Putin."" As he sought to clean up his previous remarks, Biden noted that Russia has a ""long history"" of using measures other than overt military action to carry out aggression, from paramilitary tactics to cyberattacks. ""We have to be ready to respond to these as well and decisively,"" Biden said. On Wednesday, Biden also suggested that he believed Putin would launch an attack, though he said he didn't believe the Russian President had made up his mind. ""I'm not so sure he is certain what he is going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something,"" he said. 'Stunned' Officials in Kyiv were ""stunned"" in the immediate aftermath of Biden's comments, CNN reported Wednesday. On Thursday, Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told the Wall Street Journal that Biden's comments could serve as an invitation to attack by Moscow. ""Speaking of minor and full incursions or full invasion, you cannot be half-aggressive. You're either aggressive or you're not aggressive,"" Kuleba said. ""We should not give Putin the slightest chance to play with quasi-aggression or small incursion operations. This aggression was there since 2014. This is the fact."" Biden and American officials have repeatedly sought to emphasize that Moscow would pay a heavy cost for invading Ukraine, on a scale that has not been previously seen after past Russian aggression. But Biden's comments differentiating between a full-scale invasion and a ""minor incursion"" appeared to publicly undercut that sentiment. ""There's some truth there, which didn't need to be said out loud,"" a NATO diplomat told CNN. ""But then again, it's not like the Russians didn't know that say, a cyber-attack against Ukraine, wouldn't trigger a full scale response."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki also sought to clean up Biden's comments after Wednesday's news conference. ""If there is any movement of military troops across the border into Ukraine, if they go into Ukraine and invade, that is an invasion. There will be severe economic consequences,"" Psaki said in an interview with Fox. The Biden administration on Thursday confirmed the transfer of American weapons from allies in the region to Ukraine amid concerns about a potential Russian invasion. The administration also rolled out new sanctions against four current and former Ukrainian officials, including two current members of parliament, who the US accuses of taking part on Russia's disinformation campaign against Ukraine. Blinken was in Berlin on Thursday meeting with officials from France, Germany and the UK ahead of his meeting in Geneva Friday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Blinken stressed the importance of standing up against Russian aggression, emphasizing that it's a threat not just to Ukraine but also to rules-based international principles. ""There's been a lot of speculation about President Putin's true intentions, but we don't actually have to guess -- he's told us repeatedly. He's laying the groundwork for an invasion because he doesn't believe that Ukraine is a sovereign nation,"" Blinken said. Vice President Kamala Harris said on ABC's Good Morning America Thursday, ""We will interpret any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity by Russia and Vladimir Putin as an aggressive action and it will be met with costs, severe and certain.""",4,0.868213110927664,0.7778123596836017,0.09040075124406222,20
2022-01-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/europe/biden-ukraine-comments-upset-europe-intl-cmd/index.html,Biden reveals an uncomfortable truth about NATO's divide on Russian aggression in Ukraine,"US President Joe Biden's admission that Western allies are not entirely united on how they would respond to a ""minor"" Russian incursion into Ukraine has sparked an uproar in Kiev. They were also met with concern in Europe, where officials and observers said Biden's candid remarks had turned a spotlight on an uncomfortable truth at a dangerous moment. Foreign diplomats and experts said Biden's comments were also an acknowledgment of a harsh reality: as tensions rise on the Ukrainian border, NATO allies are not all on the same page. During a rare news conference on Wednesday to mark the anniversary of his inauguration, Biden said: ""It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do. But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine."" When asked to clarify what a ""minor incursion"" was, the President said he drew the line at ""Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighters,"" before adding that ""there are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens."" The White House later clarified that Biden would consider any movement of Russian troops over the border as an invasion and would act accordingly -- and that lesser acts of Russian aggression, like a cyberattack, would be met with a reciprocal response. There is ""some truth there, which didn't need to be said out loud,"" one NATO diplomat told CNN Thursday. ""It's not like the Russians didn't know that, say, a cyber-attack against Ukraine wouldn't trigger a full-scale response."" This sentiment was echoed by a senior EU diplomat who said, ""I think he was actually quite truthful in what he said. Whether it was politically OK, I don't know."" The fear is that Biden saying this publicly will give Russian President Vladimir Putin the green light to escalate what is already a very dangerous situation. Biden said in the same answer that he predicts Russia will ""move in"" to Ukraine, which warned earlier this week that the build-up of Russian troops near the border between the two nations was ""almost completed."" The NATO diplomat who spoke to CNN said that there is a ""lack of clarity"" over what the specific response would be from NATO allies to specific Russian actions. ""There aren't yet staked out positions,"" the diplomat explained, but said it would probably ""break out on the lines you would expect -- US, UK, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Easterners would have a low-trigger threshold, everyone else a higher one."" Europe's disunity, while less dramatic than Moscow might like, was visible earlier in the week, when French President Emmanuel Macron said the European Parliament should seek to agree a new security deal with Russia and enter its own dialogue with the Kremlin. Macron has long supported the EU taking greater control of its defense and security capabilities and has led calls for a standing European army. However, even EU member states are divided on how far that should go. And countries that previously lived under the rule of the Soviet Union are deeply skeptical of doing anything that might undermine NATO, the US-led military alliance that underpins European security. Most European countries are members of NATO. Riho Terras, a former commander of the Estonia's military, said, ""Macron has an infamous quality to think out of the box and throw ideas that have little to do with the real world,"" and that his ""proposal to launch the EU dialogue with Russia falls to the same category."" Alexander Stubb, former prime minister of Finland -- another country that shares a border with Russia -- says that while ""strengthening European defense would certainly help, it would not be in Finland's interest to duplicate what NATO is already doing."" Finland is not currently a NATO member. What impact will Biden's words actually have on the situation in Ukraine? Experts were divided given the unpredictability of the situation. Terras said Russia invading Ukraine ""a bit more"" was not something the West should tolerate and that Biden's comments could ""simply encourage Putin to seize the opportunity and launch a 'minor incursion' but by his (own) definition."" Velina Tchakarova, director of the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy, believes that Biden's comments will have ""a devastating psychological effect on the European NATO allies as well as the Ukrainian establishment,"" but that they would likely not factor in Putin's thinking much because ""Moscow is used to the diplomatic language of Western officials and does not take it at face value."" Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House and author of the forthcoming book ""How Russia Gets Its Way,"" says: ""the effect of his comments in Russia may well be just as much confusion they have caused elsewhere, as Russia's government apparatus struggles to unscramble the mixed messages from Washington."" On the whole, most EU officials that spoke to CNN don't think that Biden's comments will prompt a major escalation from the Kremlin. What they are deeply upset by, however, is the finger being pointed at Europe's disunity on security quite so directly.",4,1.422646938852163,1.3362016163050119,0.0864453225471511,6
2022-01-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/us-transfer-weapons-ukraine/index.html,US accuses Russia of recruiting officials in attempt to take over Ukrainian government,"The United States accused Russia of recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to attempt to take control of Ukraine's government as it unveiled new sanctions on Thursday. ""Russia has directed its intelligence services to recruit current and former Ukrainian government officials to prepare to take over the government of Ukraine and to control Ukraine's critical infrastructure with an occupying Russian force,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement, as it rolled out sanctions against four current and former Ukrainian officials it said were involved in Kremlin-directed influence activities to destabilize Ukraine. The Treasury said the four individuals -- two of whom are current members of Ukraine's Parliament --- were acting under the direction of a Russian intelligence service sanctioned by the US and played ""various roles"" in Russia's ""global influence campaign to destabilize sovereign countries in support of the Kremlin's political objectives."" Russia recruits Ukrainian officials in top positions to gain access to sensitive information, threaten Ukraine's sovereignty and then leverage these officials to instigate unrest ahead of a potential Russian invasion, according to Treasury. The department said that the action taken Thursday is ""separate and distinct"" from the ""broad range of high impact measures"" the US is prepared if Russia invades Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the sanctions are ""in line with other actions that we have taken to target Russian disinformation campaigns."" ""The United States will continue to take steps, including through actions like this one, and in partnership with the Ukrainian government, to identify, expose, and undercut Russia's destabilization efforts in Ukraine,"" he added. The Biden administration has warned that Russia could invade Ukraine at any point but is also pursuing diplomatic efforts to convince Moscow to deescalate the situation, with Blinken set to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday to see if there's opportunity for common ground. US approves transfer of American weapons from Baltic states to Ukraine As the concerns grow about a possible Russian invasion, the State Department told Congress that it has approved export licenses for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which will allow the countries to transfer US-origin weapons to Ukraine, according to an administration official, a State Department official and a congressional aide familiar with the matter. The approvals -- which occurred in recent days -- are a signal that the US is looking to inflict a greater cost on Russian President Vladimir Putin if he goes forward with the invasion. President Joe Biden said Wednesday he expects Putin will ""move in"" to Ukraine and Blinken said this week that the Kremlin has plans for sending more troops to the Ukrainian border. The weapons include highly sought after, American anti-aircraft weapons systems from Latvia and Lithuania that would help Ukraine fend off Russian aircraft that some officials and experts believe would lead the way in the early stages of a Russian invasion. Estonia was given approval to transfer anti-tank Javelin guided missile systems, which the US has provided Ukraine with in the past. It's unclear when the weapons will arrive in Ukraine, the senior administration official said the timing -- as well as the price for Ukraine -- would be up to the countries who were given the approval. The Biden administration is also working on transferring five Russian-made helicopters into Ukrainian control, the same official said. A notification has been sent to Congress for the helicopters, Mi-17s, which are already in Ukraine for maintenance after being pulled out of Afghanistan during the withdrawal there. The State Department cited close coordination with European countries and Ukraine when asked about the export licenses transfer. ""European allies have what they need to move forward on additional security assistance from Ukraine in the coming days and weeks,"" said a State Department spokesperson. ""We are in close touch with our Ukrainian partners and our NATO Allies on this, as well as utilizing all available security cooperation tools available to us including expediting authorized transfers of US origin equipment from other allies and partners via our Third Party Transfer process and Excess Defense Articles from DoD inventories, among other mechanisms."" Earlier this week, Blinken visited Ukraine where Ukrainian officials thanked him for US security assistance. But Ukrainians have also routinely sought additional military support. In late December, the Biden administration quietly approved an additional $200 million in security assistance to Ukraine, which authorized the shipment of defensive equipment that includes small arms and ammunition, four people familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN at the time. But after multiple diplomatic meetings between the US, NATO, European officials and Russian officials ended last week without any significant breakthroughs, the Biden administration began weighing more military support for Ukraine amid more warning signs that Russia was prepping for an invasion. Biden has ruled out sending US combat troops to Ukraine to defend the country from a Russian invasion. Russia has amassed about 100,000 troops to the border it shares with Ukraine, which Blinken said Wednesday Russia could double in ""relatively short order."" Russia plans to also conduct joint military exercises with Kremlin ally Belarus, prompting further concerns from Ukraine that a new potential front line has emerged along its northern border. Biden on Wednesday acknowledged disunity within NATO over how to respond to a ""minor incursion"" from Russia, an admission that stunned and shocked Ukrainian officials in Kyiv. On Thursday, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Wall Street Journal that Biden's comments could act as an invite to Moscow to attack. ""Speaking of minor and full incursions or full invasion, you cannot be half-aggressive. You're either aggressive or you're not aggressive,"" Kuleba told the newspaper. ""We should not give Putin the slightest chance to play with quasi-aggression or small incursion operations. This aggression was there since 2014. This is the fact."" In a seeming response to Biden's remarks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday wrote on Twitter, ""We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones."" Asked about Biden's remarks distinguishing the consequences of a ""minor incursion"" against Ukraine by Russia, Blinken said on Thursday, ""if any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border and commit new acts of aggression against Ukraine, that will be met with a swift, severe, united response from the United States and our allies and partners."" Blinken, who has been traveling Europe this week for meetings on the Russia-Ukraine crisis, also dismissed suggestions that the US and allies' providing defensive military equipment to Ukraine escalates tensions with Russia. ""The idea that the provision by the United states, by European countries, by NATO, of defensive military equipment to Ukraine is somehow provocative or cause for Russia's actions has the world upside down,"" he told reporters during a press conference in Berlin. He added that the US is trying to ensure that ""Ukraine has the means to defend itself, and that might perhaps deter further aggression by Russia.""",4,2.568147198613574,2.6969352317392907,-0.12878803312571652,20
2022-01-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/europe/ukraine-russia-tensions-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html,Tensions are high on Ukraine's border with Russia. Here's what you need to know,"Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with a Russian troop build-up near the two nations' borders spurring fears that Moscow could launch an invasion. Ukraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. The picture is complicated -- but here's a breakdown of what we know. What's the situation on the border? The United States and NATO have described the movements and concentrations of troops in and around Ukraine as ""unusual."" As many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine ""as soon as early 2022."" Speaking alongside his Ukrainian counterpart in Kyiv on January 19, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had ""ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine's border, which it could double on relatively short order."" In late 2021, satellite photos revealed Russian hardware -- including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles -- on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300 km) from the border. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest intelligence assessment says Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops near Ukraine, including some 21,000 air and sea personnel, transferred more Iskander operational-tactical missiles to the border, and increased its intelligence activity against the country. The assessment came after three rounds of diplomatic talks between Russia and the West aimed at de-escalating the crisis failed to produce a resolution. US officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two. Many of Russia's military bases are to the west of the vast country -- the direction from which history suggests any threats are most likely to come. Russia's Defense Ministry has said it is conducting ""regular"" winter military drills in its southern region, parts of which border Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia, an area known as Donbas, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian forces are also present in the area, referred to by Ukraine as ""temporarily occupied territories,"" although Russia denies it. The front lines of the conflict have barely moved in five years, but there are frequent small-scale clashes and sniper attacks. Russia was angered when Ukrainian forces deployed a Turkish-made combat drone for the first time in October to strike a position held by the pro-Russian separatists. Russia also has forces numbering in the tens of thousands at its massive naval base in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014. The Crimean peninsula, which lies to the south of the rest of Ukraine, is now connected by a road bridge to mainland Russia. What's the history of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia? Tensions between Ukraine and Russia, both former Soviet states, escalated in late 2013 over a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. After the pro-Russian then-President, Viktor Yanukovych, suspended the talks -- reportedly under pressure from Moscow -- weeks of protests in Kyiv erupted into violence. Then, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, an autonomous peninsula in southern Ukraine with strong Russian loyalties, on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian-speaking citizens. First, thousands of Russian-speaking troops, dubbed ""little green men"" and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the Crimean peninsula. Within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate. Shortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence from Kyiv, prompting months of heavy fighting. Despite Kyiv and Moscow signing a peace deal in Minsk in 2015, brokered by France and Germany, there have been repeated ceasefire violations. According to UN figures, there have been more than 3,000 conflict-related civilian deaths in eastern Ukraine since March 2014. The European Union and US have imposed a series of measures in response to Russia's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including economic sanctions targeting individuals, entities and specific sectors of the Russian economy. The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of stirring up tensions in the country's east and of violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement. What's Russia's view? The Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans on invading Ukraine, insisting Russia does not pose a threat to anyone and that the country moving troops across its own territory should not be cause for alarm. Moscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO -- in terms of weaponry, training and personnel -- as a threat to its own security. It has also accused Ukraine of boosting its own troop numbers in preparation for an attempt to retake the Donbas region, an allegation Ukraine has denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia's borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances. Putin has also said that NATO deploying sophisticated weapons in Ukraine, such as missile systems, would be crossing a ""red line"" for Russia, amid concern in Moscow that Ukraine is being increasingly armed by NATO powers. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in November that weapons and military advisers were already being supplied to Ukraine by the US and other NATO member states. ""And all this, of course, leads to a further aggravation of the situation on the border line,"" he said. If the US and its NATO allies do not change course in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that Moscow has the ""right to choose ways to ensure its legitimate security interests."" What is Ukraine's view? Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO if it chooses. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN, in response to Russian calls for NATO to halt its eastward expansion. ""Any Russian proposals to discuss with NATO or the US any so-called guarantees that the Alliance would not expand to the East are illegitimate,"" it added. Ukraine insists Russia is seeking to destabilize the country with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, recently saying a coup plot, involving Ukrainians and Russians, had been uncovered. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that a planned coup could be part of Russia's plan ahead of a military invasion. ""External military pressure goes hand in hand with domestic destabilization of the country,"" he said. Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. At the same time, Zelensky's government faces challenges on many fronts. The government's popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy. Many people are also unhappy that the government hasn't yet delivered on benefits it promised and ended the conflict in the country's east. Anti-government protests have taken place in Kyiv. In a January 19 video address, Zelensky urged the Ukrainian people to ""calm down"" amid mounting unease over a possible Russian invasion. ""We are aware of everything, we are ready for everything,"" he said, before adding that he ""sincerely believes"" this year ""will pass without a war"" with Russia. Kuleba also sought to reassure Ukrainians who fear the US, its NATO allies and Russia could leave Kyiv out of discussions. ""No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine is a principle that we adhere to,"" he said. What does NATO say? NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said ""there will be a high price to pay for Russia"" if it once again invades Ukraine, a NATO partner. ""We have a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions,"" said Stoltenberg, in a December 1 interview with CNN. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO increased its defenses ""with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia ... but also in the Black Sea region,"" Stoltenberg said. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and therefore doesn't have the same security guarantees as NATO members. But Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that it cannot pursue NATO membership. High-stakes talks between Russia and NATO in Brussels in mid-January were ""not an easy discussion,"" according to Stoltenberg, who added that ""differences will not be easy to bridge."" However, NATO allies and Russia ""expressed the need to resume dialogue,"" he said. What does the United States say? President Joe Biden told Zelensky earlier this month in a phone call that the US and its allies ""will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine."" But Biden appeared to undermine that message when he subsequently suggested during a White House news conference that a ""minor incursion"" by Russia would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion of the country. While Biden vowed harsh economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the border, including restricting its financial transitions in US dollars, he suggested Western nations were not in sync on what to do should a lesser violation occur. ""There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens,"" he said. His remarks prompted a swift White House clarification. ""President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,"" press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement. One Ukrainian official told CNN he was ""shocked that the US President Biden would distinguish between incursion and invasion"" and suggest that a minor incursion would not trigger sanctions",4,2.2856941569669607,2.134113167498516,0.15158098946844456,20

Blinken's meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Kyiv Wednesday were the first of three stops the top US diplomat is making this week amid warnings from the US that Russia, which has amassed tens of thousands of troops near near Ukrainian borders, could launch an invasion at any point. ""As we meet today, Russia has ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine's border, which it could double on relatively short order,"" Blinken said during a press conference alongside Kuleba. Blinken will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday, one week after US, NATO and European officials held multiple diplomatic meetings with Russian officials that ended without any significant breakthroughs. Blinken said he would not be presenting a formal response to Russia's specific demands that NATO agree to never admit Ukraine -- which the US has said is a non-starter -- adding that it was ""not clear what Russia's central demand is or not"" and the effort now is to get at the heart of what those demands really are. ""I won't be presenting a paper at that time to Foreign Minister Lavrov,"" Blinken said. ""We need to see where we are and see if there remain opportunities to pursue the diplomacy and pursue the dialogue, which again, as I said, is by far the preferable course."" At a news conference Wednesday marking the first year of his presidency, President Joe Biden predicted a Russian invasion of Ukraine, citing existential concerns by Russian President Vladimir Putin, even as he warned of significant economic consequences when such an incursion occurs. But Biden suggested that a ""minor incursion"" would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion. ""I'm not so sure he is certain what he is going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something,"" Biden said, describing a leader searching for relevance in a post-Soviet world: ""He is trying to find his place in the world between China and the West."" Zelensky, meanwhile, said Wednesday in a video address to the nation that he ""sincerely believes"" this year ""will pass without a war"" with Russia. ""Everything is under control and everything is going according to plan,"" Zelensky said. ""Do not worry constantly what will happen in the future."" Standing alongside Blinken in Kyiv on Wednesday, Kuleba thanked the US for its support of Ukraine, while accusing Russia of trying to sow panic and stoke fear in Ukrainian institutions from the inside. ""We therefore need to apply all our efforts to prevent Russia from achieving that goal,"" he said. ""Even before we reach to our arms, our efforts are focused on making sure that the situation in Ukraine stays stable and our financial system is strong and protected."" During his meeting with Zelensky on Wednesday, Blinken reiterated that Russia has two paths out of the current situation. ""There is the path of diplomacy and dialogue to try to resolve whatever differences there are peacefully through diplomacy,"" he said in his remarks to staff at the embassy. ""Clearly the preferable path, clearly the most responsible path and the one that we would prefer, but there is also the path if Russia chooses to renew aggression, of conflict, confrontation and consequences for Russia."" Blinken said President Joe Biden had asked his team to ""take stock"" of the situation after intense negotiations with allies but also conversations with Russia, and to ""reaffirm"" the US' commitment to Ukraine. ""I strongly, strongly hope that we can keep this on a diplomatic and peaceful path, but ultimately, that's going to be President Putin's decision,"" he said. The top US diplomat will later travel to Berlin to meet with his German counterpart to discuss efforts to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine, before Blinken meets on Friday with Lavrov. Blinken and Lavrov plan to discuss Russia's military build-up and its demands for security guarantees, in what will be the first high-level meeting between Russia and the United States since the diplomatic talks last week. Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops near Ukraine, transferred more Iskander operational-tactical missiles to the border, and increased its intelligence activity against the country, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest intelligence assessment that was shared exclusively Tuesday with CNN. The Kremlin has continued to deny it is planning an attack, while demanding that the US and its Western partners rule out further NATO eastward expansion, guarantee that Ukraine would never join the block, and prevent NATO from establishing military bases in post-Soviet countries.",4,1.0269087033738815,4.21859430742729,-3.1916856040534087,20
2022-01-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/russia-ukraine-joe-biden-news-conference/index.html,"Biden predicts Russia 'will move in' to Ukraine, but says 'minor incursion' may prompt discussion over consequences","President Joe Biden on Wednesday predicted Russia ""will move in"" to Ukraine, citing existential concerns by the country's president, Vladimir Putin, even as he acknowledged disunity within NATO over how to respond to a ""minor incursion."" The candid assessment laid bare the struggle Biden faces in creating meaningful consequences and deterrents for Moscow, which remains closely intertwined economically with the United States' top European partners. The remark elicited near-immediate outcry in Kyiv, where officials have been meeting with Biden's top diplomat as Russian troops amass on the country's border. High-level attempts to clean-up the comment soon followed at the White House. While Biden vowed withering economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the frontier, including restricting its financial transitions in US dollars, he suggested Western nations were not in sync on what to do should a lesser violation occur. ""It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do,"" Biden told reporters at an East Room news conference. ""But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine."" Later, asked to clarify what he meant by ""minor incursion,"" Biden said he drew the line at ""Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighters"" ""I think that changes everything,"" the President said. ""But it depends on what he does, to what extent we'll get total unity on the NATO front."" ""It's very important that we keep everyone in NATO on the same page. That's what I'm spending a lot of time doing, and there are differences,"" he went on. ""There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens."" The candid assessment of NATO's divisions -- which have been well documented, even as US and Western officials seek to project unity amid the crisis -- left Ukrainian officials aghast. One told CNN's Matthew Chance he was ""shocked that the US President Biden would distinguish between incursion and invasion"" and suggest that a minor incursion would not trigger sanctions. ""This gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure,"" the official added, claiming he'd never heard any nuance like this from the US administration before. ""Kyiv is stunned,"" he said, referring to the Ukrainian government. The White House sought to explain Biden's remarks by pointing out a Russian attack in cyberspace or through paramilitary forces would prompt a reciprocal response compared to a scenario where Russian troops move from their positions into Ukraine. ""President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,"" press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement following Biden's marathon news conference. ""President Biden also knows from long experience that the Russians have an extensive playbook of aggression short of military action, including cyberattacks and paramilitary tactics,"" Psaki went on. ""And he affirmed today that those acts of Russian aggression will be met with a decisive, reciprocal, and united response."" A senior administration official said if Russian military forces tried to take Ukrainian territory by force and violated Ukrainian sovereignty -- whether that was a ""small portion or a large portion"" of land -- that would constitute an ""invasion"" by the Biden administration's standards and would warrant severe penalties. And while the official acknowledged the US and NATO members likely will not have the ""same list"" of targets and details matching on every measure, the response would remain ""highly unified"" and ""provide a force multiplier to actions we take."" Biden's remarks came as the US entered what officials have deemed a dangerous period, when a Russian invasion could occur at any moment. The President, while acknowledging lingering uncertainty over Putin's intentions, said Wednesday he believed the Russian leader would soon invade Ukraine. ""I'm not so sure he is certain what he is going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something,"" Biden said, describing a leader searching for relevance in a post-Soviet world. ""He is trying to find his place in the world between China and the west."" Biden's prediction of an invasion was the firmest acknowledgment to date the United States fully expects Putin to move after amassing 100,000 troops along the Ukraine border. After speaking with Putin twice last month, Biden said he believed his Russian counterpart had a good understanding of the economic sanctions he was preparing to enact. ""He's never seen sanctions like the ones I promised will be imposed if he moves, number one,"" he said, adding the level of punishment would depend on what Russia's invasion looks like. That includes limiting Russian transactions in US financial institutions -- ""anything that involves dollar denominations,"" Biden said. The President warned Russian lives would be lost in an invasion, along with potential Ukrainian casualties. ""The cost of going into Ukraine in terms of physical loss of life for the Russians -- they'll be able to prevail over time but it's going to be heavy,"" he said. ""It's going to be real. It's going to be consequential. Putin has a stark choice. Either de-escalation or diplomacy. Confrontation and consequences."" ""This is not all just a cake walk for Russia,"" he went on. ""Militarily, they have overwhelming superiority. And as it relates to Ukraine, they'll pay a stiff price immediately, near term, medium term and long term if they do it."" Biden speculated Putin was not seeking ""any full-blown war,"" but said he did believe he was looking for some type of confrontation: ""Do I think he'll test the west? Test the United States and NATO as significantly as he can? Yes, I think he will. But I think he'll pay a serious and dear price for it."" Biden's prediction came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday urged Ukrainians to not panic and to ""calm down"" over fears of a possible Russian invasion. ""All our citizens, especially the elderly, need to understand this: Everyone needs to exhale. Calm down. Don't run for emergency supplies like buckwheat and matches. To all the media: Remain as the media, not become a source of mass hysteria. Do not help the enemy in the pursuit of hype by reporting daily that war may happen tomorrow! This will definitely not stop it."" ""What is new here? Is this not the reality for the past eight years? Didn't the invasion begin in 2014? Did the threat of the war emerge just now?"" he said. The only reason for ""panic is that after eight years we are still influenced by this panic,"" he added. Zelensky said Russia's ""aim is to weaken Ukraine"" in order to force Kyiv to concede to Moscow and ""to create such a background that our 'no' sounds weaker."" The Ukrainian leader said Moscow is ""actively attacking your nerves, not our state. So that you have a constant feeling of panic.""

2022-01-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/politics/fbi-europol-vpn-ransomware/index.html,FBI & European police take down computer servers used in 'major international cyberattacks',"The FBI and police from multiple European countries and Canada have taken down 15 computer servers that were used in ""major international cyberattacks,"" law enforcement agencies said this week. Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, said that after seizing the servers, investigators have identified ""more than 100 businesses"" that were at risk of being hacked by cybercriminals, including ransomware groups. The crackdown targeted a popular virtual private networking (VPN) service that police say cybercriminals used to cover their tracks while breaching numerous organizations and trying to extort them. It's the latest effort by North American and European police to bust ransomware groups that have threatened critical infrastructure on both continents. US and European enforcement agencies in the fall arrested two people in Ukraine who allegedly made multimillion-dollar ransom demands following hacks of European and US organizations. The 10-country sting announced Tuesday involved police from Germany to the United Kingdom to Ukraine. A note from investigators on Tuesday greeted visitors to the website of VPNLab.net, the targeted VPN service: ""THIS DOMAIN HAS BEEN SEIZED."" The note said that law enforcement would continue combing through the VPN data in an effort to track the hackers. ""The cybercriminals using this VPN were committing attacks globally,"" Europol spokesperson Claire Georges told CNN in an email. The administrator of a popular Russian and English-language cybercrime forum with over 180,000 registered users has advertised the VPN service since 2009, according to Mark Arena, CEO of cybersecurity firm Intel 471. The news comes as US officials say they believe Russia, in a rare move, has arrested the person responsible for the ransomware attack on a major US pipeline operator last May. Russia has historically been reluctant to curb cybercriminals operating from its soil. It is unclear if the arrest will see the individual, whom US officials have not identified, spend any time behind bars.",20,7.734132356685659,7.539419268392102,0.1947130882935566,2
2022-01-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/europe/ukraine-intelligence-russia-military-build-up-intl/index.html,Ukraine warns Russia has 'almost completed' build-up of forces near border,"Ukraine has warned that Russia has ""almost completed"" its build-up of forces that could be used for an offensive against the country, compounding fears that Moscow could launch an invasion at any time. According to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest intelligence assessment -- shared exclusively Tuesday with CNN -- Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops in the region. ""The full strength of RF AF (Russian Federation's Armed Forces) land group at the Ukrainian direction -- (is) over 106,000 personnel. Together with the sea and air component, the total number of personnel is over 127,000 servicemen,"" the assessment said. The assessment called the situation ""difficult,"" and said Ukraine believes Russia is ""trying to split and weaken the European Union and NATO."" Russia's actions are also ""aimed at limiting the capabilities of the United States,"" the assessment said, ""to ensure security on the European continent."" The assessment comes after three rounds of diplomatic talks between Russia and the West aimed at de-escalating the crisis failed to produce a resolution last week. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said last Wednesday it was unclear whether Moscow intended to use the talks as a pretext to claim that diplomacy cannot work. Ukrainian military intelligence said Russia has deployed troops from its central and eastern regions to its western border ""on a permanent basis."" At the end of December and in January, Russia has been moving ""stockpiles of ammunition, field hospitals and security services"" to the border, it said, which according to Ukraine ""confirms the preparation for offensive operations."" The new assessment also said Russia supports more than 35,000 rebels in eastern Ukraine and has about 3,000 of its own military personnel based in rebel territory. Moscow denies having any forces in eastern Ukraine. Russia's intelligence activity against Ukraine has also intensified, the assessment said, with additional radio and satellite traffic units being deployed near the Ukrainian border and reconnaissance flights along the border having tripled since this time last year. The Ukrainian military also said Russia could use medium-range missile weapons to ""destroy vital objects,"" noting ""additional tactical groups of 'Iskander' operational-tactical missiles"" have been transferred to the border. As of mid-January, there are 36 Iskander launchers near Ukraine, according to the assessment. Iskander missiles are capable of striking targets 500-700 km (approximately 310-430 miles) away and could now target areas including the capital, Kyiv, it said. New front line The Ukrainian document warned a new potential front line has now emerged along its northern border with Belarus, a key Kremlin ally. ""The territory of Belarus should be considered as a full-fledged theater of operations that Russia can use to expand aggression against Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian military intelligence document said. US State Department officials underlined those concerns Tuesday, saying Russia's bolstered troop presence in Belarus has increased their capabilities along the Ukrainian border and led to heightened concerns about an invasion. ""What it represents is an increased capability for Russia to launch this attack. Increased opportunity, increased avenues, increased risk,"" a senior US State Department official said, adding that the troops were moved into Belarus without sufficient notice. In Belarus, Russia is ""preying on (Belarusian leader Alexander) Lukashenko's vulnerability and calling in some of those accumulated IOUs,"" the official said. ""The timing is notable and of course raises concerns that Russia could intend to station troops in Belarus under the guise of joint military exercises in order potentially to attack Ukraine from the North,"" the official said. While the official would not speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin's intent when it comes to moving troops into Belarus, the official described Putin as ""an opportunist."" ""We've seen warning signs that the dynamics inside Belarus are enabling Russia to further prey on Lukashenko's self-inflicted vulnerability,"" the official said. US officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two. ""Russian military plans to begin activities several weeks before a military invasion are something we've been watching closely and our assessment has been that could happen anytime between mid-January and mid-February,"" a second senior State Department official explained. The United States is looking closely at whether Lukashenko still has the levers of control in his country -- or whether the decision-making has been largely passed over to Russia. Belarus has become an ""increasingly destabilizing actor in the region"" the first State Department official said, pointing to a number of recent actions such as manufacturing a migrant crisis on the Poland-Belarus border, arresting activists and holding more than 900 political prisoners. 'United against Putin' Ukraine's assessment comes as the country's former President, Petro Poroshenko, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday that ""the whole world should be united against Putin,"" and that Ukraine should be allowed to join NATO. The billionaire led Ukraine from 2014 until 2019, taking power shortly after Russia invaded and subsequently annexed Crimea. He was defeated in the 2019 presidential election by incumbent Volodymyr Zelensky. ""It is absolutely necessary that there is international solidarity and unity"" against Putin, Poroshenko said, adding that Western allies should not trust the Russian leader. The 56-year-old also called for an increase in international sanctions against Russia. ""We need to make Russia weaker, and to make Russia weaker, we can do that through the sanctions. We should make Ukraine stronger. And day by day, we should receive new effective defensive lethal weapons,"" he said. Poroshenko also said ""nobody knows, including Putin"" whether a Russian invasion will actually happen and a lot will depend on the introduction of sanctions. Calling a potential invasion a ""crazy decision,"" he said the international community should ""increase significantly the price Putin should pay"" if Russian forces cross the Ukrainian border. When asked whether endemic corruption is a reason Ukraine has not been accepted as a member of NATO, Poroshenko pointed blame at his successor, Zelensky, for a ""backslide"" of corruption reforms. Poroshenko returned to the capital, Kyiv, on Monday to face treason charges linked to the financing of Russian-backed separatist fighters through illegal coal sales in 2014 and 2015. When pressed on the charges he faces, Poroshenko said the accusations were ""politically motivated"" and that prosecutors had ""zero evidence."" According to Reuters, critics say his return to Ukraine is serving as an badly timed distraction amid the political crisis with Russia.",4,4.673598564883874,3.4880878108183446,1.1855107540655294,16

The tete-a-tete with Lavrov will follow the top US diplomat's travel this week to Ukraine and Germany to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his foreign counterparts. This will be the first high-level meeting between Russia and the United States since the diplomatic engagements last week, which failed to deliver breakthroughs on the situation at Ukraine's border where Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops. The two foreign ministers spoke by phone on Tuesday, and the senior US official said it was ""in the context of that conversation"" that they agreed to meet in person. The fact that Blinken and Lavrov will meet on Friday ""suggests that perhaps diplomacy is not dead,"" the official said. The official said the two sides wanted to see if there are opportunities for ""common ground."" During Tuesday's call, Blinken and Lavrov spoke about last week's diplomatic engagements and ""stressed the importance of continuing a diplomatic path to de-escalate tensions surrounding the deeply troubling Russian military build-up in and near Ukraine,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday in a readout of the call. In Kyiv, Blinken will meet with Zelensky and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba ""to reinforce the United States' commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Price also announced Tuesday. In Berlin, Blinken will ""discuss recent diplomatic engagements with Russia and joint efforts to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine, including Allies' and partners' readiness to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia."" Blinken will meet with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, followed by a meeting with the Transatlantic Quad, which also includes the UK and France, according to Price. Blinken's visit follows last week's diplomatic talks between the West and Russian officials that ended without a commitment from Russia that it would deescalate and pull back the tens of thousands of troops it amassed on the Ukrainian border, leading a senior US official to warn that the ""drumbeat of war was sounding loud."" Following last week's diplomatic engagements, a large rift remained between Washington and Moscow over Russia's key demands, which the US and its NATO allies have deemed as non-starters. Blinken is ""150% committed to seeing if there is a diplomatic offramp here"" and that is the impetus for this engagement, the senior State Department official said. It is still too early to tell if Russia is prepared to negotiate in good faith, the official added. It remains unclear if the US will respond to Russia's proposal last week with a written response, which Russia has demanded. When asked about that the official only said that the US remains prepared to engage with Russia on ""on security issues and meaningful dialogue."" Meanwhile, the US has been assuring Ukraine of its commitment to the country amid new warning signs and US intelligence that suggest Russia is preparing a Ukraine invasion. The US has information indicating Russia has prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to create a pretext for an invasion, which CNN first reported and the White House later confirmed. These operatives are ""trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia's own proxy forces,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. Russia has also begun evacuating its embassy in the Ukrainian capital, which could potentially be preparation for a looming conflict, The New York Times reported. Russia has denied the report and said the embassy is operating as usual. Blinken will be the latest US official to visit with Zelensky, after CIA Director Bill Burns met with the Ukrainian leader last week and a delegation of US senators met with Zelensky on Monday.

In a brief stand-off at border control after arriving on a flight from Warsaw, Poroshenko accused border guards of taking away his passport. He later emerged to a crowd of thousands of cheering and flag-waving supporters outside the airport. Poroshenko's return sets up a showdown with President Zelensky's government in what critics say is an ill-judged distraction as Ukraine braces for a possible Russian military offensive and seeks the support of its Western allies. Western diplomats called for political unity in Ukraine before the arrival of Poroshenko, who was president from 2014 until 2019. Poroshenko, 56, is being investigated for alleged treason linked to the financing of Russian-backed separatist fighters through illegal coal sales in 2014-15. He could face 15 years in prison if convicted. His party accused Zelensky of a reckless attempt to silence political opposition. Zelensky's administration says the prosecutors and judiciary are independent and accuses Poroshenko of thinking he is above the law. ""We are not here to protect Poroshenko, but to unite and protect Ukraine,"" Poroshenko told the crowd, before heading to the Pechersk court in central Kyiv for a hearing into his case, as supporters chanted outside the building. During a break in the court session, he told the crowd: ""The authorities are confused, weak, and instead of fighting (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, they are trying to fight us."" Tetiana Sapyan, a spokeswoman for the State Bureau of Investigations (DBR), told a separate briefing that the DBR was apolitical. Russian troop buildup On Friday, Zelensky's chief of staff batted away suggestions that Zelensky was behaving like Viktor Yanukovych, a former president who was backed by Russia and whose political rival Yulia Tymoshenko was jailed in a case that Western countries widely condemned as politicized. The row has raged as Ukraine tries to rally Western support in its standoff with Moscow after sounding the alarm about a buildup of tens of thousands of Russian troops near its borders. A confectionary tycoon, Poroshenko was elected as head of a pro-Western government after the Maidan street protests that ousted Yanukovych in 2014. Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed in 2014 after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and backed separatist fighters in a conflict in eastern Ukraine. Zelensky trounced Poroshenko in an election in 2019. He ran on a ticket to tackle corruption and curb the influence of oligarchs in the former Soviet republic. Prosecutors asked a Ukrainian court in December to arrest Poroshenko, with the possibility of bail set at 1 billion hryvnia ($37 million).",4,3.8322676834148806,4.168443806341882,-0.3361761229270015,22

""If Putin sees deterrence coming back from the United States and our NATO allies, he may second guess his calculation to invade Ukraine. Now Ukraine is the breadbasket of Russia. Putin wants to restore the glory of the old Soviet empire. He's been wanting to do this for quite some time."" McCaul added: ""I'm not seeing a lot of deterrence. I'm seeing some tough rhetoric, but not a lot of action ... you have to put things on the table like sanctions, you have to talk about more arm sales, weapon sales to Ukraine.""

Russia would not commit to de-escalating and American and NATO officials said Moscow's demands -- including that NATO never admit Ukraine into the alliance -- were non-starters.

The disclosure is an added worry for Ukrainian government agencies after many of their websites were hacked this week and replaced with threatening messages to Ukrainians that their data had been compromised. While it is unclear who was responsible for the dual cybersecurity incidents, they come as Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukraine border and after talks between the West and Moscow have failed to deescalate the situation. The ""destructive"" computer code represents ""an elevated risk to any government agency, non-profit or enterprise located or with systems in Ukraine,"" Microsoft said in a blog post Saturday. Microsoft researchers said the computer code was designed to look like ransomware, but that it lacked some of the common features of ransomware and was ""inconsistent with cybercriminal ransomware activity.""

2022-01-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/15/politics/putin-russia-ukraine-border/index.html,Putin presents a profound threat to peace in Europe as 'drumbeat of war' sounds on Russia-Ukraine border,"Europe has a long and bloody history of wars, of borders brutally contested, of nations and empires carving destructive furrows far from home. But a sad harvest of sorrow and loss after the Second World War was followed by decades of relative peace and prosperity, even during a Cold War that did not become hot. Today that peace is being severely tested by Russian President Vladimir Putin as he masses troops on Ukraine's border and diplomats are raising the alarm in stark terms. The US ambassador to the 57 nation, globe straddling Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, Michael Carpenter, warned on Thursday that European security is facing a ""crisis"" and ""the drumbeat of war is sounding loud."" Putin, whose nation buried tens of millions of its own in European wars, is unearthing fresh grievances about the post-World War peace, specifically the role of NATO, the transatlantic defensive alliance and counterpoint to Russia's predecessor, the Soviet Union. Last summer in a 20-page document citing centuries of blood-spattered history, Putin laid claim to Ukraine, which in 1991 regained its independence following the Soviet Union's collapse, stating ""Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are all descendants of Ancient Rus, which was the largest state in Europe."" He concluded ""our spiritual, human and civilizational ties formed for centuries have their origins in the same sources ... true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia."" As commander of the world's fifth largest army, and barely halfway through an expected almost four-decade rule, Putin is setting the stage to stake his claim just as his ancestors did, positioning forces on Ukraine's border awaiting his command. Having already invaded Crimea in 2014, fears Russian troops will again cross the border have never been higher. The past week of talks -- bilaterally with the US in Geneva Monday, with NATO in Brussels Wednesday and culminating at the OSCE in Vienna on Thursday -- which were meant to ease tensions, seem to have achieved the opposite and entrenched Putin's emissaries in hostile rhetoric. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov set the tone on Monday demanding ""ironclad, waterproof, bulletproof, legally binding guarantees, not assurances, not safeguards, guarantees"" that NATO deny Ukraine and others membership and roll back to 1997 lines. Two days later, after NATO talks in Brussels, another deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, threatened force if they don't get what they want. ""We have a set of legal military-technical measures that we will apply if we feel a real threat to [our] security, and we already feel [it],"" he said. By Thursday when talks reached the OSCE, whose territory circumnavigates the northern hemisphere from Russia's easternmost frozen tundra to Alaska's icy western tip and where both Russia and Ukraine are members a diplomatic permafrost had formed. Russia's OSCE ambassador, Alexander Lukashevich, warned of ""a moment of truth"" with ""catastrophic consequences"" if Russia's ""principles are violated."" In Moscow Friday, Putin's long serving Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned ""the West got carried away,"" and tapping into Russian folk law, hinted Putin's diplomacy may have run its course, saying: ""We have been harnessing slowly, but now it's time for us to ride."" The same day, Ukrainians woke to a massive cyberattack taking down government websites. Russia hasn't claimed responsibility, but Europe's top diplomat Josep Borrell left little doubt who he thinks was behind the attack, saying, ""It's difficult to say [who is behind it]. I can't blame anybody as I have no proof, but we can imagine."" By Russian design or the stuttering effects of stalling diplomacy, the talks are seeding spiraling consequences. Borrell promised counter measures to the cyberattack, ""We are going to mobilize all our resources to help Ukraine to tackle this cyberattack. Sadly, we knew it could happen."" In the US, President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday suggested Putin may have given up on talks with none scheduled in the days ahead, and on Friday the US raised the stakes further, charging that Moscow had ""prepositioned a group of operatives"" to execute ""an operation designed to look like an attack on them or Russian-speaking people in Ukraine"" to create a reason for ""a potential invasion,"" according to Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby. The Kremlin strenuously denied the accusation. What happens next? On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky invited Biden and Putin to hold three-way talks to discuss the security situation, according to Ukrainian state media outlet Ukrinform. Lavrov has stated he believes NATO needs to make the next move, ""We are waiting for answers from our colleagues, written answers, put on paper."" But Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary general, told CNN on Wednesday that it's up to Russia to respond to NATO's diplomatic outreach on arms control talks and other reciprocal military agreements. ""We are waiting for the answer to our proposal to convene a meeting addressing a wide range of important issues for European security,"" he said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also indicated the US is waiting on the Russian President. ""Is he going to choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue to resolve some of these problems? Or is he going to pursue confrontation and aggression?"" the secretary asked Thursday. The wait is re-awakening uncomfortable memories for Europeans. Denmark's Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod branded Putin's actions ""totally unacceptable,"" saying he is ""trying to take us back to the coldest, darkest days of the Cold War."" But with Putin seemingly adamant he will not back down, history's shadow is pressing on the shoulders of leaders across the continent who are becoming increasingly aware that fateful decisions may lie ahead.",4,2.1564662378325257,1.6735624475234354,0.48290379030909025,6
2022-01-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/europe/ukraine-cyber-attack-government-intl/index.html,Cyberattack hits Ukraine government websites,"Scores of Ukrainian government websites were targeted in a cyberattack with threatening text warning Ukrainians to ""be afraid and wait for the worst"" and alleging their personal information has been hacked. Ukraine claimed Russia was most likely behind the attack, which affected the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies. Oleg Nikolenko, Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman tweeted on Friday that the ""investigation is still ongoing but the Security Service of Ukraine has obtained preliminary indicators suggesting that hacker groups associated with the Russian secret services may stand behind today's massive cyberattack on government websites."" Ukraine's communication intelligence service said in a statement that as many as 70 central and regional authority websites were targeted. The attack appears to be a low-level incident but is symbolic coming at the end of a week of frantic diplomacy involving NATO, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and bilateral talks between Russia and the United States -- all aimed at trying to deescalate tensions on Ukraine's border. ""This is not the first time or even the second time that Ukrainian Internet resources have been attacked since the beginning of the Russian military aggression,"" the Ukrainian Information Ministry said in a statement. Most of the affected state resources have already been restored, according to Ukraine's security service, who said that personal data had not been breached. What happened? Early Friday morning local time, Ukrainian government websites, including that of the Foreign Ministry, displayed dark screens with a threatening text that said Ukrainians' personal information had been hacked. ""Ukrainian! All your personal data has been uploaded to the public network. All data on the computer is destroyed, it is impossible to restore them,"" the message, published in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish, read. ""All information about you has become public, be afraid and wait for the worst. This is for you for your past, present and future. For Volhynia, for the OUN UIA [Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists Ukrainian Insurgent Army], for Galicia, for Polesie and for historical lands,"" the web page read. The UIA and OUN were Ukrainian ultranationalist groups that fought for independence during the Soviet era, while Galicia, Volhynia and Polesie are areas from which they historically drew high levels of support. A statement from Ukraine's Ministry of Culture and Information Policy suggested that the text mentioned the groups and regions as a ""way to conceal the ""Russian footprint"" by hackers."" ""It is obvious that this was done on purpose to cast a shadow over the hacker attack on Poland: Russia and its proxies have been working for a long time to create the quarrel between two friendly neighboring countries,"" the ministry added in a statement. The Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement that although ""provocative messages were posted on the main page of these sites,"" the content of the sites was not changed, adding ""the leakage of personal data, according to preliminary information, did not occur."" The websites of the ministries of education, foreign affairs, sport, energy, agrarian policy, veterans, environment and the state emergency service of Ukraine and the state treasury were targeted, according to state media Ukrinform. The Ministry of Education and Science, whose official website is down, directed citizens to use the ministry's official social media channels on Friday while the issue is being resolved. The head of Ukraine's technical security and intelligence service Yuri Shchigol said almost 70 websites of central and regional authorities had been affected. ""It appears that each of these sites was developed on behalf of the government of Ukraine by a Ukrainian firm named Kitsoft,"" said Matt Olney, director of threat intelligence and interdiction at Talos, the threat intelligence unit of technology giant Cisco, told CNN. ""While obviously unfortunate, we do not see this event alone as indicating an increase or decrease of [cyber] risk in Ukraine,"" he added. Oleksandr Iefremov, the CEO of Kitsoft, said the firm was ""actively involved in restoring"" the government websites that it supports. Not all of the Ukrainian government websites affected by the hack run Kitsoft software, Iefremov said in a statement sent to CNN. ""We test vulnerabilities, bugs, and update government websites that are supported by Kitsoft company in a timely manner,"" Iefremov said. ""Unfortunately, not all the customers order website support, so we dіd not have access to them."" While the Ukrainian government has suggested Russian involvement in the hack, outside experts say they cannot make that attribution without forensic evidence. Oleh Derevianko, founder of Kyiv-based cybersecurity firm ISSP, said he wasn't surprised by the defacement of government websites. ""It's a good illustration how you can use a simple defacement attack as an informational operation tool when everyone is so nervous and agitated about potential invasion,"" he told CNN. Attacks add to an 'already tense situation' The EU's chief diplomat Josep Borrell condemned the cyberattack, warning it contributes to the ""already tense situation"" in the region. During a joint press conference with the French foreign minister in Brest, France, on Friday, Borrell, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said he convened an emergency meeting upon learning of the attack on Ukrainian government websites. ""Such actions aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian contribute to further escalation of the already tense situation,"" Borrell said. When asked if Russian governmental or non-governmental actors were behind the attacks, Borrell responded that although he didn't want to ""point fingers"" there ""is a certain probability as to where they came from."" Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Friday that it is ""too early to draw conclusions"" as to who is behind the attack, but said there is a ""long record of Russian cyber assaults against Ukraine in the past."" Separately, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense alleged in a statement Friday that Russian special services are preparing provocations against servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces in order to accuse Ukraine. The statement from the ministry's intelligence directorate said: ""The military units of the aggressor country and its satellites receive orders to prepare for such provocations."" CNN has contacted Russia's defense ministry for comment on both allegations. Tensions with Russia at a high The US and Russia met this week for high-stakes talks aimed at averting a war, as Russia continued to mass troops near Ukraine's borders amid a dispute over NATO activities in Eastern Europe and the prospect that Ukraine could join the military alliance. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with the Russian military build-up spurring fears that Moscow could launch an invasion in the coming weeks or months. Ukraine has said that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion, and Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. A senior US official warned that the ""drumbeat of war is sounding loud"" after a week of talks ended Thursday without clear breakthroughs. Russian officials suggested they were poised to abandon discussions over the US and NATO's refusal to entertain Moscow's key demands: a guarantee that Ukraine will never be permitted to join NATO and that the alliance roll back its expansion in Eastern Europe. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a press briefing that while Moscow's proposals were ""aimed at reducing the military confrontation, de-escalating the overall situation in Europe, exactly the opposite is happening in the West."" He said: ""We absolutely do not accept the appearance of the North Atlantic Alliance on our borders, especially taking into account the course pursued by the Ukrainian leadership - both by the former and the current ones. These are truly the red lines and they know it.""",20,1.5670362773184616,1.7865854342306076,-0.21954915691214594,1
2022-01-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/us-intelligence-russia-false-flag/index.html,First on CNN: US intelligence indicates Russia preparing operation to justify invasion of Ukraine,"The US has information that indicates Russia has prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine, a US official told CNN on Friday, in an attempt to create a pretext for an invasion. The official said the US has evidence that the operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia's own proxy forces. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the Defense Department has credible information indicating Russia has ""prepositioned a group of operatives"" to execute ""an operation designed to look like an attack on them or Russian-speaking people in Ukraine"" in order to create a reason for a potential invasion. The allegation echoed a statement released by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense on Friday, which said that Russian special services are preparing provocations against Russian forces in an attempt to frame Ukraine. National security adviser Jake Sullivan hinted at the intelligence during a briefing with reporters on Thursday. ""Our intelligence community has developed information, which has now been downgraded, that Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating the pretext for an invasion,"" Sullivan said on Thursday. ""We saw this playbook in 2014. They are preparing this playbook again."" The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Friday that ""the military units of the aggressor country and its satellites receive orders to prepare for such provocations."" Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, denied that Moscow was preparing for provocations in Ukraine. ""So far, all these statements have been unfounded and have not been confirmed by anything,"" Peskov said. The US intelligence finding comes after a week's worth of diplomatic meetings between Russian and Western officials over Russia's amassing of tens of thousands of troops along Ukraine's border. But the talks failed to achieve any breakthroughs, as Russia would not commit to de-escalating and American and NATO officials said Moscow's demands -- including that NATO never admit Ukraine into the alliance -- were non-starters. A number of Ukraine's governmental websites were hit by a cyberattack on Friday, a development European officials warned would ratchet up tensions over Ukraine even further. 'We saw this playbook' The US official said that the Biden administration believes Russia could be preparing for an invasion into Ukraine ""that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives."" ""The Russian military plans to begin these activities several weeks before a military invasion, which could begin between mid-January and mid-February,"" the official said. ""We saw this playbook in 2014 with Crimea."" Kirby said that Putin is likely directly aware of Russian false-flag operatives that could be the pretext for an operation in Ukraine. ""If past is prologue, it is difficult to see that these kinds of activities could be, would be done without the knowledge if not the imprimatur of the very senior levels of the Russian government,"" Kirby told reporters Friday. The US has also seen Russian influence actors begin to prime Russian audiences for an intervention, the official said, including by emphasizing narratives about the deterioration of human rights in Ukraine and increased militancy of Ukrainian leaders. ""During December, Russian language content on social media covering all three of these narratives increased to an average of nearly 3,500 posts per day, a 200% increase from the daily average in November,"" the official noted. The US, NATO and European officials held high-stakes meetings this week with Russian officials. At the end of the three meetings on Thursday, both sides came away with a pessimistic outlook. Russia's deputy foreign minister suggested the talks had reached a ""dead-end"" and saw no reason to continue them, while a senior US official warned that the ""drumbeat of war was sounding loud"" following the diplomatic sessions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that Russia believes NATO will increase its activity along its border with Ukraine if Moscow doesn't obey the West's demands. ""While our proposals are aimed at reducing the military confrontation, de-escalating the overall situation in Europe, exactly the opposite is happening in the West. NATO members are building up their strength and aviation. In the territories that are directly adjacent to Ukraine, on the Black Sea, the scale of exercises has increased many times recently,"" Lavrov said. Ukraine government websites hit by cyberattack Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has invited President Joe Biden and Putin to hold three-way talks to discuss the security situation, said Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak, according to Ukrainian state media outlet Ukrinform. On Friday, a number of Ukrainian government websites, including its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were targeted in a cyberattack with threatening text that warned Ukrainians to ""be afraid and wait for the worst."" Ukraine's government said that it appeared Russia was behind the attack. A US National Security Council official said the President Joe Biden had been briefed on the attack. The official said the US did not have an attribution for the attack yet but would ""provide Ukraine with whatever support it needs to recover."" The Pentagon said that it was too soon to attribute the attack, though Kirby noted, ""This is of a piece of the same kind of playbook we've seen from Russia in the past."" The European Union's chief diplomat Josep Borrell condemned the cyberattack, warning it contributes to the ""already tense situation"" in the region. When asked if Russian governmental or non-governmental actors were behind the attacks, Borrell responded that although he didn't want to ""point fingers,"" there was ""a certain probability as to where they came from.""",4,1.3764101350780118,2.0750386460630477,-0.6986285109850359,20
2022-01-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/us-russia-colonial-pipeline-hack-arrest/index.html,US officials believe Russia arrested hacker responsible for Colonial Pipeline attack,"The US believes that Russia's domestic intelligence agency has arrested the hacker responsible for the May ransomware attack that forced a major US fuel pipeline to shut down for days, a senior Biden administration official told reporters Friday. It appears to mark a rare instance of US-Russian cooperation against a major cybercrime group, following direct appeals from President Joe Biden to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The cyberattack against Colonial Pipeline in May prompted the company to preemptively shut down its fuel distribution operations, leading to widespread shortages at gas stations along the East Coast. The official spoke to reporters after Russia's FSB intelligence agency said Friday that, at the behest of US authorities, it had detained multiple people associated with REvil, a type of ransomware that has cost US firms millions of dollars. The US and Russia do not have an extradition treaty. While Russian authorities said those apprehended would be prosecuted, the extent to which that will happen is unclear. The FSB said Russian authorities had seized millions of dollars, raided the homes of 14 people and detained an unspecified number of people connected with the so-called REvil ransomware. REvil was used in damaging hacks on a top US meat supplier in May and US software provider Kaseya in July, with the latter infecting up to 1,500 businesses around the world, US officials have previously said. The FSB's announcement follows a week of talks among the US, its European allies and Russia that failed to reach a breakthrough over the tens of thousands of troops Russia has amassed near Ukraine's border. ""In our mind, this is not related to what's happening with Russia and Ukraine,"" the senior administration official said. But some cybersecurity analysts pointed to the timing of the FSB announcement, which comes as the US has threatened severe sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine. ""This is Russian ransomware diplomacy,"" Dmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert who is chairman of the non-profit Silverado Policy Accelerator, told CNN. ""It is a signal to the United States: If you don't enact severe sanctions against us for invasion of Ukraine, we will continue to cooperate with you on ransomware investigations.""",20,1.6636670447069082,4.397423848622502,-2.7337568039155937,2
2022-01-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/13/politics/russia-talks-diplomacy-uncertain-thursday-osce/index.html,US warns Russia is sounding 'drumbeats of war' against Ukraine as crisis talks end with no breakthrough,"A senior US official warned Thursday that the ""drumbeat of war is sounding loud"" following a week's worth of diplomacy between the West and Russia that wrapped up Thursday. The effort ended without clear breakthroughs over the tens of thousands of Russian troops amassed on the Ukrainian border, leaving prospects for future diplomacy and de-escalation in doubt as Russian officials suggested they could soon turn to military options. Both US and Russian officials sounded a pessimistic note over the talks following Thursday's meeting in Vienna at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It was the third session that capped a week of intensive meetings that the United States and its NATO allies hoped could spur Russia to pursue a path of ""de-escalation and diplomacy"" rather than mobilizing the tens of thousands of Russian troops whose presence has swelled along Ukraine's borders. But Russian officials reacted with frustration and impatience coming out of the meetings, suggesting they were poised to abandon discussions over the US and NATO's refusal to entertain Moscow's key demands: A guarantee that Ukraine will never be permitted to join NATO and that the alliance roll back its expansion in Eastern Europe. The US and its NATO allies have repeatedly said such proposals from Moscow are non-starters. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov suggested the talks had reached ""a dead-end or a difference in approaches"" because the US and NATO would not address Moscow's demands about Ukraine never joining NATO, he said, according to Russian state media TASS. Ryabkov said he didn't see a reason for the two sides to continue talks, even though the US has suggested they would continue beyond this week. Following Thursday's session, the US Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter told reporters that the ""drumbeat of war is sounding loud and the rhetoric has gotten rather shrill"" ""We have to take this very seriously,"" Carpenter said of the massing of Russian troops along the border with Ukraine. ""We have to prepare for the eventuality that there could be an escalation."" Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, the OSCE chairman, warned after Thursday's meeting that the ""risk of war in the OSCE area is now greater than ever before in the last 30 years."" The diplomatic efforts this week -- which included separate sessions between Russia and the US, NATO and the OSCE -- were aimed at pulling back Russia from a potential invasion of Ukraine. But Russia did not commit to pulling back the more than 100,000 troops now along the border, and the Russian military conducted live-fire exercises along the border this week as the talks were ongoing. 'The jury's out on which path Vladimir Putin is going to choose' US officials made clear heading into the talks they did not know whether Russia was serious about diplomacy or just planned to use the sessions as a pretext for military action. ""The jury's out on which path Vladimir Putin is going to choose,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday in an interview with MSNBC. ""Is he going to choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue to resolve some of these problems or is he going to pursue confrontation and aggression?"" National Security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House Thursday that the US and its allies remain prepared for any outcome following this week's talks. ""The discussions were frank and direct. They were useful. They gave us and our allies things to consider; they gave Russia things to consider,"" Sullivan said. ""We will now reflect and consult with allies and partners on how to proceed,"" Sullivan told reporters at the White House. Sullivan said that the Biden administration planned to share information soon about Russian disinformation operations that could lay the groundwork for a pretext to invade Ukraine. ""Our intelligence community has developed information, which has now been downgraded, that Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating the pretext for an invasion,"" Sullivan said. A senior US official said that in the last several days Russia has ""continued to add capacity"" near the border. The official said that it wasn't a ""substantial"" number of troops or equipment, but it's a signal that Kremlin is not de-escalating. Russia's next move still unclear It's still unclear what the US plans to do if Russia doesn't de-escalate but also doesn't invade Ukraine. Throughout the week, US officials have said Russia will face consequences like they have never seen if an invasion happens. But the Biden administration is not planning to impose any costs on Russia as a deterrent. A senior State Department official said there is nothing that would change that approach. ""I don't think there's any desire to impose sanctions or consequences in advance of Russian action on the ground. I don't think that would be a productive way to go,"" the official told CNN. ""I think we maintain leverage if we reserve the right to impose those consequences in the aftermath of an escalation."" The head of the US delegation, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, told reporters after the talks at NATO that the Russians themselves may not know yet what their next move is. Throughout this week's talks, the US has repeatedly argued that diplomacy can't happen unless Russia de-escalates, which Sherman on Monday said the US defined as Russia returning its troops to barracks or telling the US ""that exercises are ongoing and what their purpose is."" After Wednesday's meeting at NATO, Sherman said Russia had not committed to any de-escalation. Top Biden administration officials have made clear that they expect talk to continue in the near future, without providing details for what those talks might look like. ""We would expect to have additional engagement with the Russian Federation in the coming days. We hope that engagement takes place, we hope this diplomatic track continues, but even more importantly, we hope it bears fruit,"" State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said on Wednesday. Russia says US demands are 'unacceptable' Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov responded Thursday that the US demands were ""unacceptable."" ""I do not think we need to explain how absolutely unacceptable such demands are, and, of course, we will not even discuss them,"" Lavrov said. US officials have expressed hope that discussions over areas of mutual interest between Russia and the US -- including nuclear weapons, intermediate range missiles and transparency over military exercises -- could keep the diplomatic conversations going. NATO leaders noted that Wednesday was the first time Russia had agreed to a meeting with the alliance in two years and they sat through the four hour-long meeting, which was longer than had been scheduled. ""I think the reality is that I will say that the Russian delegation sat through nearly four hours of a meeting where 30 nations spoke, and they did, which is not an easy thing to do,"" she said Wednesday. But if that gave the impression Russia might have been open to compromise positions, Russia quickly poured cold water on it. ""The US and its NATO allies are not ready to meet Russia halfway on the key issues,"" Ryabkov said Thursday, according to state news agency TASS. ""The main problem is that the United States and its NATO allies, under no guise, for any reason are not ready to meet our key demands."" Blinken had warned before the talks that no breakthroughs were expected this week ""in an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head."" As Russia and NATO appeared to talk past each other, the language they used illustrated how far apart they remain. Russia had proposed specific treaty language in the weeks ahead of the meetings and called them ""negotiations,"" while Sherman countered that no formal terms were put forward in what she described as ""discussions."" Sherman said earlier in the week that she did not know if the Russians had come to the table for the three days of talks in good faith, or as a pretext in an attempt to justify future military action. ""If Russia walks away, however, it will be quite apparent they were never serious about pursuing diplomacy at all,"" she said. ""That is why collectively we are preparing for every eventuality.""",4,1.6461477041952253,0.8501226937497529,0.7960250104454724,17
2022-01-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/europe/nato-russia-council-summit-ukraine-intl/index.html,US says Russia made no commitments to de-escalate Ukraine crisis after latest round of talks,"Russia has not committed to de-escalate on the Ukrainian border after two rounds of diplomatic talks this week, Deputy US Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Wednesday, as the US acknowledged it's still unclear whether Moscow intends to use the talks this week as a pretext to claim that diplomacy cannot work. Sherman told reporters that Wednesday's meeting between NATO and Russia ended with a ""sober challenge from the NATO allies to Russia"" to respond to the opportunities offered by the international community to de-escalate the situation on the border with Ukraine and choose the path of diplomacy. But Sherman, who spoke forcefully about the West's unified message to Moscow following the roughly four-hour session in Brussels, made clear the US and its Western allies don't yet know what Russian President Vladimir Putin's aims are following the diplomatic meetings, with more than 100,000 Russian troops positioned on the Ukrainian border. In statements Wednesday, Russian officials suggested Moscow could resort to military action if political efforts fail. That warning came a day after the Russian military conducted live-fire exercises along the border. As the talks this week, the US has finalized sanctions options in the event that Russia invades Ukraine, senior administration officials said on Wednesday. ""When live fire exercises are reported this morning. What is this about?"" Sherman said, referring to reports about Russian exercises. ""Is this about invasion? Is this about intimidation? Is this about trying to be subversive? I don't know. But it is not conducive to getting diplomatic solutions."" Asked by CNN's Alex Marquardt if the Russians had made any commitments to de-escalate, Sherman said they did not. ""There was no commitment to de-escalation, no,"" she said, before pausing and adding: ""Nor was there a statement that there would not be."" Sherman suggested that the Russians themselves may not even know how they intend to use or act upon this week's diplomatic talks with the US and NATO. She said that the US believes that progress can be made -- if Russia engages on issues where there are overlapping interests. ""There is plenty to work on, where we have places where we can enhance mutual security. There are some places we cannot. But there is progress that can be made,"" Sherman said. Sherman told CNN's Christianne Amanpour later Wednesday that she believed Putin amassed troops on the border of Ukraine in order to ""put pressure on Europe and the United States, to put pressure on the euro Atlantic ambition, to... intimidate, to coerce, and to say 'I've got sticks I can bring to this discussion' as well."" Russia says situation is becoming 'intolerable' Following Wednesday's meetings, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko warned that Moscow would resort to military measures if the political course fails to fend off threats to its security, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti. ""We have a set of legal military-technical measures that we will apply if we feel a real threat to (our) security, and we already feel (it), if our territory is considered as an object for targeted strike weapons,"" Grushko told reporters, according to Russian state media. ""Of course, we cannot agree with this. We will take all necessary measures to fend off the threat by military means if it does not work out with political means."" Russia's deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin also issued a statement Wednesday sounding pessimistic about the talks, saying it was NATO who was ignoring Russia's proposals to de-escalate -- and warning that could lead to conflicts. ""The Russian side has repeatedly proposed to the alliance to take measures to de-escalate the situation,"" Fomin said. ""On the part of the alliance, Russian initiatives were ignored. This creates prerequisites for incidents and conflicts, undermines the foundations of security."" Grushko said that the Russian side told NATO countries the current situation was becoming ""intolerable"" for Moscow. During Wednesday's roughly meeting -- which went longer than scheduled -- Sherman said that the US and its NATO allies once again made clear Russia's demand Ukraine never be permitted to join NATO was a non-starter. Sherman called it ""hard to understand"" how Russia could feel threatened by Ukraine when it has the largest conventional military in Europe. Wednesday's session with the NATO-Russia Council was the second of three planned for this week. The US delegation led by Sherman met with the Russians on Monday, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will hold a session with Russia on Thursday in Vienna. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday that the meeting between NATO and Russia over the situation in Ukraine was ""not an easy discussion"" and that ""differences will not be easy to bridge,"" but added that NATO allies and Russia ""expressed the need to resume dialogue."" ""We had a very serious and direct exchange on the situation in and around Ukraine and the implications for European security,"" he told reporters. ""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues. Our differences will not be easy to bridge but it is a positive sign that all NATO allies and Russia sat down around the same table and engaged on substantial topics."" US finalizes sanctions options The Biden administration has sanctions targets and implementation measures ""ready to go to be issued when those tanks cross the border,"" a senior administration official said. ""The final package will depend upon exactly what scenario we are facing,"" the official said. ""But we are no longer at the point where we have just a memo that lays out options. We have concrete actions that we are ready to hit the return key on."" As CNN previously reported, the White House over the last several weeks had been analyzing the impacts various sanctions options would have not just on Russia but also on the European and American economies. Biden administration officials said Wednesday the US and its allies determined that while severe economic sanctions will likely have global economic ramifications, any spillover can be managed. ""The European financial system and its overall economy are in far better health than in 2014, particularly in the banking sector,"" one of the officials said. The US is also aware of the risk that Putin tries to retaliate against any economic sanctions by weaponizing the export of Russian gas to Europe, which relies heavily on Russian energy supplies. One of the officials said that if Putin went down that path, it would ""stiffen the resolve of Europe to find supplies elsewhere."" ""We are well aware of the potential impact of a reduction of Russian energy supply, both in the European market"" and globally, the official said, adding that a range of contingency options for that scenario are being developed. Sources familiar with those contingencies said they include fuel switching, in which certain energy sources are replaced with others to meet demands, as well as the increased import of liquid natural gas from LNG-producing countries like Norway, the Netherlands, Qatar, and the UAE. European authorities are also looking at how much of a buffer their storages would provide in the event Russia shut off exports, the sources said. They emphasized that Russia's economy is also highly dependent upon gas export revenues. Asked about efforts by some Republican members of Congress, particularly Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, to sanction the Russia-Germany gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 and essentially kill the project, the senior administration officials said they believe doing so now would reduce the West's leverage over Russia. Even before the latest Russian troop buildup on the Ukraine border, however, the Biden administration waived additional, congressionally mandated sanctions on Nord Stream 2, arguing that doing so would damage US relations with Germany, which sees the pipeline as a commercial project. Russian troops conduct live-fire exercises Wednesday's meeting comes as the two sides are stuck in deadlock, with fears mounting that Russia could launch an invasion into Ukraine. Moscow has dismissed such claims. However, Russia has been amassing as many as 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian frontier, and on the eve of the talks, the military began live-fire drills in regions close to the border. The United States, NATO and their allies are pushing Russia to de-escalate the situation. Moscow has demanded security guarantees from the US and NATO, including a binding pledge that NATO won't expand further east and will not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance -- something NATO is not willing to do. ""At this point, let me be very, very clear -- no one is suggesting that we alter NATO policy on enlargement,"" US Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told CNN on Tuesday. Rather than being framed as a bilateral NATO-Russia meeting, Wednesday's gathering saw each of NATO's 30 member states and Russia represented equally, in a forum of 31. The meeting is the second of three key engagements between the West and Russia this week. On Monday, representatives from the US and Russia sat down in Geneva for more than seven hours of discussions. The marathon talks, which the White House described as ""frank and forthright,"" did not produce a breakthrough. Another round of talks between Russia and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) -- of which the US is a member -- are scheduled in Vienna on Thursday. Ukraine said Tuesday that it was confident that the US and other NATO countries would not make a decision ""on the fate"" of the country ""behind our backs"" during the meetings.",4,2.083309620472796,1.1601698154338225,0.9231398050389736,17
2022-01-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/politics/ambassador-nato-julianne-smith-russia-ukraine-talks-cnntv/index.html,US ambassador to NATO says NATO and Russia 'committed to dialogue' ahead of talks Wednesday,"The United States, NATO allies and Russia are all ""committed to dialogue"" ahead of Wednesday's high-stakes meeting to discuss Russia's military buildup along the Ukrainian border, US Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said Tuesday. ""I think right now, folks feel that both the allies and the Russians, including the United States, all are committed to dialogue at this juncture,"" she told CNN's Alex Marquardt in an exclusive interview from NATO headquarters in Brussels. ""All of the allies are committed to engaging in a dialogue with Russia tomorrow. But simultaneously, the allies are all united in messaging to the Russians that should they decide to further invade Ukraine, they would face massive consequences from NATO and also from the EU as well,"" she said. Wednesday's meeting is the second of three key engagements with Russia meant to defuse the growing threat posed by Russia to neighboring Ukraine as Moscow amasses thousands of troops along the border. On Monday, the representatives and Russia sat down in Geneva for more than seven hours of discussions. In the wake of Monday's talks, Russia has continued to demand guarantees that Ukraine never be allowed to join NATO. Smith told CNN that ""frankly, I don't see a lot of compromise"" on the issue of NATO's approach to enlargement. ""At this point, let me be very, very clear -- no one is suggesting that we alter NATO policy on enlargement,"" Smith said. ""The door remains open. No one has the right to kick the door shut. And any decision about enlargement will continue to rest between the NATO alliance and the country in question."" But she said that there will be other issues on the table to discuss with Russia, including an ongoing conversation about placing ""some reciprocal limits"" on military exercises and missiles. Russia has been amassing as many as 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border, and Smith told CNN on Tuesday that the US has not ""seen any clear signs of de-escalation"" from Russia amid the talks. ""Russia is still maintaining about 100,000 forces right on the border with Ukraine. We believe they have plans to bring more forces forward,"" she said. Smith reiterated that the Russians' excuse that they are amassing troops for exercises, ""doesn't really hold water at this point."" ""They claim they're exercising. That seems like an awful lot of forces to have on the border for an exercise and there was no notification of any sort of exercise either. So we're not exactly clear why they're massing forces on the border,"" Smith said. Monday's talks between the US and Russia in Geneva, Switzerland, were ""frank and forthright,"" US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman told reporters. But she said she does not know yet whether Russia is prepared to de-escalate the situation on Ukraine's border.",4,0.5083959870890975,0.5701060812005281,-0.06171009411143058,17
2022-01-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/10/politics/us-russia-ukraine-meetings-geneva-intl/index.html,US says no breakthrough in 'frank and forthright' talks with Russia over Ukraine border crisis,"US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said she does not know yet whether Russia is prepared to de-escalate the situation with Ukraine following its massive build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine's border and fears of a possible invasion. Sherman met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov on Monday in the first of three sets of bilateral talks slated for this week. She told reporters that the session was ""frank and forthright"" but that it is too soon to say whether the Kremlin was serious about diplomacy. ""I don't think we know the answer to that,"" Sherman said when asked if the US got an indication that Russia is prepared to de-escalate on the Ukrainian border. ""We will see whether in fact Russia understands that the best way to pursue diplomacy is for them to reduce those tensions and to de-escalate."" The talks, which wrapped up Monday after more than seven hours in Geneva, Switzerland, follow months of tension near the Ukraine-Russia border, where more than 100,000 Russian soldiers have massed. Ryabkov told reporters after the meeting that despite American concerns about the Russian troop buildup along the Ukrainian border, Moscow had no intention of launching military action. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans to attack,"" he said. ""All the combat trainings of troops are carried out within our national territory, and there is no reason to fear any escalation scenario in this regard."" Sherman said that the US ""certainly urged Russia to de-escalate"" adding: ""But we will see."" She said that the US did not set specific timelines for anything. Sherman said the US defines de-escalation as Russia returning its thousands of troops on the border with Ukraine to their barracks or explaining what exercises they are conducting and what their purposes are. The Russians told the US that the massing of troops on the border was not a precursor to an invasion, she said. ""I don't think you'd be surprised to hear that Russia indeed said to us as they said publicly, they do not intend to invade, these are just maneuvers and exercises,"" Sherman said. ""And they can prove that in fact they have no intention by deescalating and returning troops to barracks,"" she said. Week of high-stakes talks Monday's talks were the first of three sets of meetings on tap this week, with NATO talks with Russia on Wednesday in Brussels, followed by talks Thursday in Vienna between Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The US and Russia had ""useful discussions"" on Monday, Sherman said, but they did not negotiate about specifics. Sherman said the US delegation pushed back on Russian proposals that were ""simply nonstarters,"" such as Russia's demand in the lead-up to this week's sessions that NATO pledge never to admit Ukraine, saying that ""we will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy."" Sherman again stressed the US would not have discussions about Ukraine or Europe without those partners in the room. Ryabkov described the talks as ""businesslike"" and ""professional."" But he said no progress had been made when it came to NATO, where he reiterated Russia's demands for ""ironclad"" guarantees that NATO would not expand further east and would never admit Ukraine. ""On the central question, on no expansion of NATO, my answer would be, would be a flat and plan no: No progress,"" Ryabkov said. ""And this is one of the major problems before. And I would say the rest depends, to a great extent, on what will happen further down the road on this, exactly on this issue."" Sherman said that the US delegation expressed openness to discussing the future of certain missile systems in Europe along the lines of the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, as well as ways that both sides could set ""reciprocal limits on the size and scope of military exercises"" and to improve transparency about those exercises. She noted that both the US and Russia understand that issues as complicated as arms control will take longer than a few days or weeks. Sherman said the US would have further conversations with the Russian government after the multilateral discussions this week. Deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Monday as the talks wrapped that he does not ""see a situation in which the US walks away"" from talks with Russia, even if Kremlin officials take positions during this week's discussions that are considered nonstarters by the US. ""Russia put out positions that are nonstarters and said other things we think maybe present some areas in which we can work to make progress, and we're going to find that out during the course of this week,"" Finer said. US quietly authorized $200 million in Ukraine aid In late December, the Biden administration quietly authorized an additional $200 million in security assistance to Ukraine, according to four people familiar with the matter. The security package authorized the shipment of much of the same defensive equipment the US has provided in the past, including small arms and ammunition, secure radios, medical equipment, spare parts and other equipment. The package was authorized just weeks before the US and Russia were set to begin this week's talks. The administration quietly notified Congress of the new authorization earlier this month, two of the people said. Some officials found out about it though classified channels, two of the sources added. The equipment will likely take some time to deliver -- a delivery of $60 million worth of equipment authorized last summer is only now nearing completion, a State Department official told CNN. The State Department said that weaponry was delivered over the last few weeks and that assistance will continue, but declined to discuss specifics. ""I'm not going to get into every tranche and update of security assistance. The point is: we have given more security assistance to Ukraine in the last year than at any point since 2014. Those deliveries are ongoing, as recently as in the last few weeks, and there are more scheduled in the coming weeks,"" a State Department spokesperson said. By contrast, earlier the State Department has spoken to specific details surrounding the additional security assistance that was authorized. In this case the Biden administration appeared to want to keep this new package out of the limelight ahead this week's talks, two congressional sources said. The National Security Council referred CNN to the State and Defense departments for comment. The Pentagon did not respond to requests for comment. As of mid-December, the US had provided Ukraine with more than $450 million in security assistance, a White House official told CNN at the time. By the end of the year, the administration had delivered new Javelin missiles and Command Launch Units, Island Class Patrol Boats, first aid kits, secure radios, electronics, medical equipment, engines, generators, spare parts and other equipment, the official said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told ABC on Sunday that the administration had continued to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine ""as recently as the last couple of weeks"" and that ""if there is further aggression by Russia against Ukraine, we'll see even more of that."" One source familiar with the assistance said that it is not a game-changer and would not be enough to serve as a major impediment to a Russian invasion. The Ukrainians have made clear to the US that they want more security assistance -- beyond the kinds of defensive weaponry already provided, the source explained. Breakthrough unlikely The global community will be closely following the discussions, which have been billed as a late attempt to avert a war on Europe's eastern flank. Still, Blinken played down the prospects of a breakthrough on the eve of the talks. ""It's hard to see making actual progress, as opposed to talking, in an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head. So, if we're actually going to make progress, we're going to have to see de-escalation, Russia pulling back from the threat that it currently poses to Ukraine,"" Blinken said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""We're here because repeatedly over the last decade, Russia has committed acts of aggression against neighbors -- Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine in 2014, and now the renewed threat about Ukraine today,"" he added. ""It's also not about making concessions. It's about seeing whether, in the context of dialogue and diplomacy, there are things that both sides, all sides can do to reduce tensions,"" Blinken said. On Sunday, Sherman and Ryabkov held a dinner that was ""difficult but business-like"" ahead of Monday's formal session, Ryabkov told state news agency RIA Novosti. The State Department readout of the dinner said Sherman ""stressed the United States' commitment to the international principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances."" As many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained gathered near the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings estimated last month that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine ""as soon as early 2022."" Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call earlier this month that the US and its allies ""will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.""",4,1.820203622892628,1.4208973353059446,0.3993062875866833,17

""It's hard to see making actual progress, as opposed to talking, in an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head. So, if we're actually going to make progress, we're going to have to see de-escalation, Russia pulling back from the threat that it currently poses to Ukraine,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. The US and Russia are set to meet on Monday in Geneva for high-stakes talks aimed at averting a war, as Russia has continued to amass troops near Ukraine's borders. The top US diplomat disputed the notion that there was a risk of setting a precedent in which Russian President Vladimir Putin could create leverage by building up forces on the borders with neighboring countries like Ukraine. ""It's exactly the opposite,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""First of all, why are we here? We're here because repeatedly over the last decade, Russia has committed acts of aggression against neighbors -- Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine in 2014, and now the renewed threat about Ukraine today."" ""Second, there are large principles at stake that go to the fundamentals of international peace and security,"" he continued, noting that the US is joined by international partners ""to make it clear to Russia that this aggression will not be accepted, will not be tolerated."" ""It's also not about making concessions. It's about seeing whether, in the context of dialogue and diplomacy, there are things that both sides, all sides can do to reduce tensions,"" Blinken said. He said the US was prepared to discuss certain measures such as arms control and the scope and scale of military exercises but stressed that they must be reciprocal with Russia. He ruled out discussions of pulling troops from eastern Europe and guaranteeing that NATO would not expand to include Ukraine. ""When it comes to the deployment of forces and troop levels, we're not looking at troop levels. To the contrary, if Russia commits renewed aggression against Ukraine, I think it's a very fair prospect that NATO will reinforce its positions along its eastern flank,"" Blinken said on ABC's ""This Week."" He also said the US has been providing ""significant defensive assistance to Ukraine, including as recently as the last couple of weeks."" On Kazakhstan protests Blinken condemned the ""shoot to kill"" order issued by the president of Kazakhstan Friday amid deadly protests in the central Asian nation. ""I condemn that statement, and if that's an actual policy, condemn that policy, the 'shoot to kill,'"" he said on ""State of the Union."" Speaking on ABC's ""This Week,"" Blinken called for the order to be rescinded. ""Kazakhstan has the ability to maintain law and order, to defend the institutions of the state, but to do so in a way that respects the rights of peaceful protesters and also addresses the concerns that they've raised -- economic concerns, some political concerns,"" he said on ABC. Blinken said the US has ""real questions about why it was necessary to call in this organization that that Russia leads and is a part of."" ""These ought to be things that the government of Kazakhstan can handle on its own and handle in a rights-respecting way,"" he said.

2022-01-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/07/politics/blinken-russia-talks/index.html,Blinken says talks with Russia on Ukraine crisis need to be a 'two-way street' to be successful,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that progress can be made during next week's diplomatic talks between US, European and Russian officials, but that it had to be a ""two-way street"" with Russia deescalating its aggression toward Ukraine. Speaking following a meeting with NATO foreign ministers Friday, Blinken reiterated that the US and its allies were prepared to address any ""legitimate concerns"" Russia had about NATO's actions if Russia reciprocated. But Blinken accused Russia of attempting to ""draw us into a debate about NATO"" to misdirect from Russia's buildup of forces near Ukraine's border. ""Moscow is simultaneously driving the false narrative that NATO is threatening Russia, that NATO plans to station military infrastructure in Ukraine to stir conflict with Russia, that NATO swore after the cold war not to admit countries in Eastern Europe, and that NATO has broken those promises,"" Blinken said at a news conference at the State Department. ""Each of those claims is false."" Blinken also said that the idea of Ukraine as the aggressor -- which Russia has pushed -- is ""absurd."" Blinken said that Russia currently has ""nearly 100,000 troops today"" built up ""on Ukraine's border"" and has ""plans to mobilize twice that number on very short order."" The NATO Foreign Ministers meeting on Friday was a chance for the US and its allies to coordinate and demonstrate unified opposition to Russian aggression towards Ukraine ahead of what's expected to be a week of intense diplomacy, a US official and two European officials explained. A second US official explained that the sequencing of diplomacy with Russia next week -- with US-Russia talks first, NATO talks with Russia second, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) talks with Russia last -- was very deliberate. The order of events will allow Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who leads the bilateral talks for the US side, to take the temperature of the Russian approach early on in the week and inform allies about what was shared in those initial conversations so that they can develop a game plan together. While US and European officials continue to press that Russia cannot be rewarded for their military buildup -- and that the country must deescalate the situation with Ukraine before anything else can happen -- they also privately acknowledge that Russia will need an off-ramp, US and European officials told CNN. But creating an offramp is tricky, the officials said, because it will need to be something that Russia can herald at home as a win but also something that does not actually award Russia. One area to watch is the possibility of the US moving heavy weaponry that it has in Poland further West given Russian sensitivities about its borders, one European official said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who also spoke Friday after the NATO meeting, said that the alliance welcomed Russia's willingness to ""come to the table and talk"" but was prepared for ""the possibility that diplomacy will fail."" Blinken reiterated on Friday that the US was prepared to dole out ""massive consequences,"" including new economic measures, if Russia's military buildup on Ukraine's border continues. Biden administration officials, however, are still weighing how the US would penalize Russia if it invades Ukraine. On Friday, a news report that the US was developing plans to change its force posture in Eastern Europe if Russia deescalated its aggression toward Ukraine alarmed Baltic states, who began reaching out to US officials asking about how serious it was, two US officials told CNN. The Biden administration forcefully pushed back on the report. ""It is not accurate that the administration is developing options for pulling back U.S. forces in Eastern Europe in preparation for discussions with Russia next week,"" State spokesman Ned Price tweeted. Kazakhstan unrest Next week's talks are occurring amid the backdrop of unrest in Kazakhstan, where the country's leader -- with the help of Russian forces -- has tamped down on protests that turned violent. The situation has the potential to complicate the upcoming talks, though so far White House officials say the Kazakhstan violence will not delay or otherwise change the three sets of talks set to begin in Geneva on Monday. Blinken said Friday that the US remains ""very concerned about the ongoing state of emergency"" in Kazakhstan and has questions about the country's request for peacekeeping forces from the Collective Security Treaty Organization, an alliance of former Soviet states that includes Russia. ""It would seem to me that the Kazakh authorities and government certainly have the capacity to deal appropriately with protests, to do so in a way that respects the rights of protestors while maintaining law and order,"" Blinken said. ""So, it's not clear why they feel the need for any outside assistance."" Blinken said he hoped the Kazakh government to address ""fundamentally economic and political"" problems that he said have led to the protests. His remarks come after the Russian government said that Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the situation in Kazakhstan with CSTO leaders following the arrival of Russian CSTO forces in Kazakhstan. Blinken said that US was not conflating what's happening in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, though he added, ""One lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave.""

Biden, however, has signaled that the US will not make any concessions on either NATO or Ukraine's future. ""We made it clear to President Putin that if he makes any more moves, goes into Ukraine, we will have severe sanctions. We will increase our presence in Europe with our NATO allies, and it'll just be a heavy price to pay for it,"" the President said after a New Year's Eve lunch in Wilmington, Delaware.

And so he did not disagree with any of that,"" Biden said. He said that both sides laid out their concerns, ""but I made it clear that it only could work if he deescalated, not escalated."" During his call with Putin on Thursday, Biden urged him to take steps to ease the crisis on Russia's border with Ukraine, warning again of dire economic consequences should Putin proceed with an invasion. Putin told Biden that introducing a new round of sanctions against Russia would amount to a ""colossal mistake"" that could lead to a complete breakdown of relations between the two countries, a Kremlin aide said.

Biden conducted the call from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. The Biden-Putin talks come roughly two weeks before Americans and Russian diplomats are scheduled meet in Geneva to discuss the ongoing crisis. In the lead-up to those discussions, Russia publicly offered a list of security concerns and demands it wants addressed, including a commitment that Ukraine never be allowed to join the NATO and that military equipment from the alliance not be positioned in its former Soviet states. The United States has prepared its own list of concerns, a senior US administration official told reporters on Wednesday, but isn't planning to release it publicly. Instead, Biden's advisers believe it will be more fruitful to keep the negotiations private. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will lead the US delegation to the talks, which are set for January 10, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. Biden and Putin are not expected to participate themselves. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov will lead the Russian delegation. Pentagon and National Security Council officials will also attend the talks on the US side, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. The direct US-Russia talks will be followed by broader meetings between NATO and Russia, along with a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, where a slate of topics are up for discussion. The US has pledged to keep western European nations and Ukraine itself in the loop as Biden engages Putin diplomatically. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and White House officials said they were in near-daily contact with counterparts from the United Kingdom, France and Germany to coordinate their approach. ""There is a significant amount of security coordination between Ukraine and the United States and the coordination has only been intensifying in recent weeks,"" said an adviser to Zelensky. The US has been able to convince its allies to prepare a set of harsh sanctions, including on some of Putin's top allies, as part of a coordinated approach. US officials have said the punishment would be far more severe than sanctions applied in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. Since Biden last spoke to Putin, there have not been indications Russia is easing its posture on the border with Ukraine, though a senior administration official said the situation was fluid. ""It is not entirely static from our perspective,"" the official said. ""It remains a continuing source of grave concern what the Russians have been putting in place in and around that border area."" The Russian buildup has included troops, artillery, vehicles and supply lines, officials have said previously. Earlier this week, Russia announced it would withdraw 10,000 troops back to their regular barracks. But US officials suggested the move did not amount to a major de-escalation. In the meantime, the US has maintained its own posture in the region. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman and its escort ships to stay in the Mediterranean area rather than sail to the Middle East as part of an effort to reassure European allies. Ahead of the discussion on Thursday, the US Air Force flew another spy plane over eastern Ukraine to gather intelligence about the military situation on the ground, a source familiar with the mission told CNN. It was the second time this week the US carried out such a mission using the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS). The first flight, on Monday, marked the first time a JSTARS aircraft had ever flown over the region, Lt. Cmdr. Russ Wolfkiel, a spokesman for US European Command, told CNN. Wolfkiel told CNN the US ""routinely operates aircraft in the Black Sea region in support of various US and coalition intelligence objectives,"" but the flights come as the US has been trying to collect intelligence about Russia's troop movements along the Ukraine border. The JSTARS system can track ground vehicles when they are moving, collect imagery, and relay photos and tracks of moving formations to ground and air commanders, which in turn would allow the US and its allies to monitor Russia's force posture. An on-board antenna has a 120-degree field of view that can cover nearly 20,000 square miles to monitor ground movements, according to an Air Force fact sheet, and can also detect aircraft.

Monday's flight was the first time an E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft has flown over the region, according to Lt. Cmdr. Russ Wolfkiel, a spokesman for US European Command. While the Pentagon has not revealed exactly what intelligence the aircraft was gathering, Wolfkiel told CNN that the US ""routinely operates aircraft in the Black Sea region in support of various US and coalition intelligence objectives."" The aircraft flew with the permission of the Ukrainian government, and while the exact route has not been revealed, Wolfkiel said it stayed out of the Donbas region where pro-Russian separatist forces demanding independence from Ukraine operate. Still, the aircraft sensors can collect intelligence about military movements on the ground, potentially on both sides of the border, without entering disputed areas or Russian airspace. An on-board antenna has a 120-degree field of view that can cover nearly 20,000 square miles to monitor ground movements, according to an Air Force fact sheet, and can also detect aircraft. The developments come as tensions continue to rise given Russia's military buildup on its border with Ukraine, which has led the US to urge de-escalation and warn of economic sanctions should Russia invade its neighboring country. US intelligence findings have estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine ""as soon as early 2022"" as it amasses up to 175,000 troops along the border. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed in a statement Saturday that 10,000 troops had return to their permanent bases after completing training near the Ukrainian border. CNN reported Tuesday that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman and its escort ships to stay in the Mediterranean area rather than sail to the Middle East as part of an effort to reassure European allies of the US military's commitment to defense of the region. The move will keep US warships in the region during upcoming US and Russian talks as well as expected Russian talks with NATO next month. President Joe Biden on Monday signed into law the annual military funding bill that includes $300 million in military aid to the Ukrainian Security Assistance Initiative, which provides training, equipment and support to Ukraine's efforts to secure its borders. Biden also plans to hold a call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Thursday afternoon ""to discuss a range of topics, including upcoming diplomatic engagements with Russia,"" National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne told CNN on Wednesday.",4,2.4264913635514693,3.4494569576741556,-1.0229655941226863,16

""We have been clear that there will be significant consequences"" if Russia attacks, the official said. The penalties would be coordinated closely with US allies and partners and would severely damage Russia's economy, the official said. Such a move would also result in NATO capabilities being moved closer to Russia. In a statement posted to Twitter on Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss used similar language, emphasizing that any incursion would be ""a massive strategic mistake and would be met with strength, including coordinated sanctions with our allies."" She condemned Russia's ""aggressive and inflammatory rhetoric"" against Ukraine and NATO, adding that the UK's support for Ukraine was ""unwavering."" The US and Russia both indicated on Thursday that the ball is in the other's court when it comes to deterring an invasion of Ukraine, showing little sign that a diplomatic agreement is imminent as Russian President Vladimir Putin has continued to mass forces near Ukraine's border -- despite a direct warning by President Joe Biden earlier this month to de-escalate. Speaking just hours after Putin's marathon year-end news conference, in which he said Russia's actions will depend on the US's and NATO's ""unconditional ensuring of Russia's security today and in the future,"" the US official said the Biden administration is prepared to discuss some of Russia's concerns. But the official said Russia has made some demands ""that they know we can never agree to."" And in an apparent rebuke of Russian officials' insistence in recent days that it would engage only in bilateral talks with the US, the official said any dialogue ""must also take place in full coordination with our allies."" Still, the official said, ""the Biden administration is willing to engage with Russia through multiple channels as soon as early January."" A date and time for the discussions has not been set yet. Putin blames West for growing tensions In his annual year-end news conference on Thursday, Putin deflected when asked whether Russia plans to invade Ukraine. ""How would the Americans react if, on their frontier with Canada, we deployed our missiles?"" he told reporters. ""It's a question of security, and you know our red lines."" ""They just deceived us blatantly. Five waves of NATO expansion. And there you go -- they're now in Romania and Poland, with weapons systems,"" Putin added. White House press secretary Jen Psaki pushed back on Putin's comments on Thursday: ""Well, facts are a funny thing, and facts make clear that the only aggression we're seeing at the border of Russia and Ukraine is the military buildup by the Russians and the bellicose rhetoric from the leader of Russia."" Psaki added that NATO ""is a defensive alliance, not an aggressive alliance. There is no evidence to the contrary, to suggest anything to the contrary, from the United States or NATO members, and of course our efforts are to work with and defend our NATO partners."" Adding to the flurry of diplomatic activity surrounding the crisis, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with both Truss and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday about the Russian aggression and the consequences they would be prepared to impose in the event of an invasion. The White House said national security adviser Jake Sullivan had spoken Thursday with Ukrainian Head of Presidential Administration Andriy Yermak, discussing ""their shared concerns and common approach regarding Russia's military build-up near Ukraine's border."" The White House statement said Sullivan also had ""underscored the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Aggressive moves by Moscow More Russian military units have been sent to the border area in recent days, sources familiar with the intelligence tell CNN. The latest US intelligence assessments place more than 50 so-called ""Battalion Tactical Groups"" deployed on and around the Ukraine border. US and Ukrainian officials have also seen evidence that Russia has begun diverting commercial air and rail systems to support the military effort, though similar air and rail activity was visible in the spring during Russia's last military buildup, which was ultimately pulled back. Russia has been demanding security guarantees from the US and NATO, including a binding pledge that NATO won't expand farther east and will not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance, according to a draft proposal posted online last week by Russia's Foreign Ministry. The senior administration official told reporters on Thursday that ""we don't plan to negotiate in public"" and declined to say which aspects of Russia's proposals were open to negotiation. ""I expect we will have our substantive response in those talks"" in January, the official said. ""We have not responded substantively to the proposals that have been made other than to say ... clearly there are some things that have been proposed that we will never agree to, and I think the Russians probably know that on some level. We think there are other areas where we may be able to explore what's possible.""

Putin also discussed the situation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, the Kremlin said in a statement. According to a readout published by the Kremlin, Putin reiterated his demands to Scholz. ""Vladimir Putin informed [Olaf Scholz] about Russian proposals for long-term, legally binding security guarantees, excluding any further NATO advance to the east, as well as the deployment of offensive weapon systems in countries adjacent to Russia,"" the statement said. Earlier on Tuesday, Putin said his demands towards NATO did not amount to ""an ultimatum."" ""Is this an ultimatum or not? Of course not,"" he told security officials during a meeting at the Russian Ministry of Defence. ""We are hoping for constructive and meaningful negotiations with a visible end result within a specified time frame, which would ensure equal security for all.""

More Russian military units have been sent to the border area in recent days, sources familiar with the intelligence tell CNN. US and Ukrainian officials have also seen evidence that Russia has begun diverting commercial air and rail systems to support the military effort, though similar air and rail activity was visible in the spring during Russia's last military buildup that was ultimately pulled back. The latest US intelligence assessments place more than 50 so-called ""Battalion Tactical Groups"" deployed on and around the Ukraine border with six more in transit on the way. These groups, which can typically include as many as 900 personnel each, are highly diversified and fairly self-sufficient combat units with a combination of troops, artillery, anti-tank weapons, reconnaissance and engineering units. BTGs, as they're known, played a leading role in Russian military activity in Ukraine in 2014. The Biden administration still sees a window to deter a Russian invasion, assessing that Putin has not yet decided whether to launch an attack. But a White House official emphasized to CNN that ""we believe talks would be more productive were they to happen in an environment of de-escalation, instead of escalation."" Russia has been demanding security guarantees from the US and NATO, including a binding pledge that NATO won't expand further east and will not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance, according to a draft proposal posted online Friday by Russia's foreign ministry. Russian officials presented Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried with the proposals while she was in Moscow this week, which Donfried said she would share with US allies and partners. But despite an offer to facilitate a meeting with Russia and NATO to discuss Moscow's concerns, Biden has signaled that the US will not make any concessions on either NATO or Ukraine's future. ""One nation can't force another nation to change its border; one nation cannot tell another to change its politics; and nations can't tell others who they can work with,"" Biden told Putin during their meeting, according to a senior White House official. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg echoed that sentiment in a press conference on Thursday. ""We believe that dialogue is important especially when times are difficult as they are now,"" he said. ""And our invitation to Moscow to meet in the NATO-Russia Council stands, and we are ready to sit down.

Recent satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies and provided to CNN show that Russia has massed troops and equipment as close as 30 miles away from Ukraine's border. The images show an increase between September 7 and December 5 in the number of Russian military vehicles in the southwestern Russian city of Soloti. Russia appeared to be setting up a new regiment within its 3rd Motor Rifle Division, an infantry division of Russia's ground forces, according to Michael Kofman, the research program director in the Russia Studies Program at CNA. ""The 3rd division is still being set up, as is the 144th,"" Kofman said. But he noted that the main source of Russia's buildup can be seen more in the movements by Russia's 6th army, the 1st in Voronezh, the 41st in Yelnya, and the 58th and 49th armies in Crimea. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who just returned from Ukraine, told reporters earlier this week that the next step to watch in the evolution of the Russian presence near the Ukrainian border is if they call up reserve forces. Russia continues to deny that it is putting the pieces in place for an invasion. But Putin has said that Russia has the right to ""defend its security"" in the face of a potential eastward push by NATO. The Biden administration is still weighing whether to send more weapons and equipment to Ukrainians, following shipments in the last two months of Javelin anti-tank missiles and Command Launch Units, Island Class Patrol Boats, first aid kits, secure radios, electronics, medical equipment, engines, generators, spare parts, as well as small arms and ammunition. Ukrainian officials have also been pushing for air defense systems, like Patriot surface-to-air missiles, from the US, according to people familiar with their requests. But National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has conveyed the US' concerns that such shipments might be viewed by Russia as highly provocative, at a moment when the US, Europe and NATO are trying to get Moscow to de-escalate. Still, the White House has not ruled anything out completely, apart from putting US troops on the ground in Ukraine. ""As we pursue diplomatic channels, we will also prepare for all contingencies,"" Sullivan told reporters earlier this month. ""Just as we have been doing for weeks now, including through the preparation of specific responses to Russian escalation should they be required -- specific, robust, clear responses should they be required.""",4,3.103284568474119,2.640121478033899,0.46316309044021997,16

Some of the lawmakers, part of a three-day bipartisan delegation, are recommending cutting off Russia from financial markets if it invades Ukraine. Other lawmakers say that in the meantime the administration should focus on deterrence, including messaging that makes clear ""a lot of Russian boys will die on day one"" and providing Ukraine with a significant enough boost in weapons supplies that the Russians think twice about invading at all. ""I learned that we have an important window in the next few weeks to deter further Russian aggression from happening, everything from a limited incursion to including a full-scale invasion,"" Rep. Seth Moulton told CNN, based on his conversations on the ground. ""The key thing is that we need to be more focused on preventing Russian action than responding to it."" The Massachusetts Democrat and other lawmakers on the House Armed Services Committee met with US partners in Kiev to assess the situation as Russian troops have built up a massive presence along the Ukrainian border and Russian President Vladimir Putin continued a string of calls to world leaders -- speaking to French President Emmanuel Macron and Finnish President Sauli Niinistö on Tuesday following his December 7 call with President Joe Biden -- to repeat his demand for guarantees that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will not expand to Ukraine or deploy weapons there. The White House says Biden told Putin in the video call that the United States is prepared to launch strong economic measures should Russia invade -- signaling that these new measures would pack a bigger punch than the sanctions issued in 2014 that failed to stop Russia from occupying Crimea. Biden said he had told the Russian leader the repercussions of an invasion would be like nothing Putin has ever seen before. On Tuesday, Moulton told CNN he had sent a memo to the Biden administration urging it to take more proactive steps to prevent any further Russian aggression. The memo gets into tactical details about further American weaponry that should be provided to Ukraine and how forces should be deployed. Moulton said he is also pressing administration officials to be more vocal -- to Putin and directly to the Russian people -- about how costly and bloody a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be. Moulton was accompanied by Rep. Salud Carbajal, a Democrat from California; Rep. Mike Waltz, a Republican from Florida; Rep. Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina; and Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona. The lawmakers' trip came as the top US diplomat for Europe also visited Kiev and used the opportunity to dispute claims that the United States would push Ukraine to make concessions to Russia. 'Pure disinformation' ""The notion that we would push Ukraine to make concessions in discussions and dialogue with Russia is pure disinformation and should be treated as such,"" Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried said in a video message recorded in Kiev and tweeted by the US Embassy on Tuesday. She said that message had been shared with Ukraine's leaders and that ""the truth"" was that the US, Ukraine and NATO allies were ""united"" in their efforts to pursue diplomacy. ""We are committed to ensuring no decisions or discussions take place about Ukraine without Ukraine,"" Donfried said. She said the US had ""listened closely to the request of our Ukrainian colleagues, who have asked the United States to become more actively engaged in diplomatic efforts to revive the peace process."" Gallego told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield in an interview from Kiev on Sunday that he believes that if Putin ""is given enough room,"" the Russian leader ""is willing to do something, whether it's one month, two months or five months from now, or one year from now."" Gallego said the delegation has procured information on the trip that shows Russia intends to ""influence and/or invade Ukraine at some point."" If it does, the repercussions should be immediate and harsh. ""Shut them off from the US dollar so they can't trade anymore,"" Gallego said, adding that in order for Russia to ""invest or sell, they have to go to a secondary market, and if that ends up being the euro, we also have to put pressure on that."" He added that in conjunction with economic sanctions, Ukraine should be provided better weaponry that ""will actually put a toll on the Russian troop movements and, you know, unfortunately that means we have to kill some Russians,"" while referring to the Ukrainian army and special forces, and not US forces. He reiterated that Russians ""only understand pure power, and we have to give the Ukrainian army and special forces the ability to do that."" House lawmakers led by Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey have written to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urging Republicans to act swiftly to move fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills forward ""in part because doing so is necessary to unlock vital additional assistance to Ukraine at a moment when Russian forces are massing on its borders threatening an invasion."" 'Day one' Malinowski, Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee and other Democrats told McConnell in a December 13 letter that ""the administration is maximizing its ability to deliver essential military hardware to the Ukrainians in the face of Putin's brinksmanship. But the administration could begin to do much more with the increased assistance designated in FY22 appropriations for Ukraine -- assistance that would enhance Ukraine's ability to deter Russian aggression, protect NATO's eastern flank, and send an essential message of support to the Ukrainian people."" Moulton asserts that the Biden administration needs to be more proactive with actions, not just words. ""The administration clearly does not want to provoke Putin, but he does not care about provocations. He will manufacture one whenever he pleases. We need to be less concerned about provoking Putin and more concerned about deterring him,"" Moulton said. Moulton also believes it's necessary to publicize America's intentions widely -- not just to Putin, but also to the Russian people. ""US weapons procurement to Ukraine should change the focus from seeking to make a long-term conflict more costly to deterring a conflict from ever starting,"" Moulton said. ""We can do that by making day one extremely costly, and communicating that. We need to make it clear not only to Putin but to Russian people that a lot of Russian boys will die on day one.""",4,2.0600814714218396,2.1547238177941757,-0.09464234637233604,20

In a letter to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Appropriations Vice Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby on Monday, Democratic House Reps. Tom Malinowski, Steve Cohen, Gerald Connolly and Marcy Kaptur urged Republicans to come to the table to hash out the 2022 appropriations bill ""in part because doing so is necessary to unlock vital additional assistance to Ukraine at a moment when Russian forces are massing on its borders threatening an invasion."" State Department officials expressed similar concerns in a briefing to the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week, and members came away concerned by the possibility that Ukraine could be left increasingly vulnerable if a new spending bill isn't passed soon, Rep. Malinowski told CNN. ""As you know, the administration is maximizing its ability to deliver essential military hardware to the Ukrainians in the face of Putin's brinksmanship,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter. ""But the administration could begin to do much more with the increased assistance designated in FY22 appropriations for Ukraine."" ""As long as we continue to operate on a continuing resolution, the President's hands are partly tied,"" they added, ""limited to providing equipment already in stock or in the pipeline, and unable to use the millions of additional dollars that Congress has designated to support Ukraine's self-defense."" The administration last week transferred the ""final elements"" of a $60 million security assistance package to Ukraine that Biden approved earlier this year, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said during a press briefing last Wednesday. The assistance included ""small arms and ammunition"" that were set to arrive in the country late last week. The National Defense Authorization Act, passed last week, authorized roughly $300 million for additional security assistance to Ukraine but those funds still need to be appropriated. The lawmakers wrote that the FY22 appropriations package would complement already flowing emergency aid, and allow the administration to send ""more anti-tank weapons for Ukrainian soldiers facing down Russian tanks, more grenade launchers to take on Russian attack helicopters, more night vision systems to deal with Putin's little green men, as well as enhanced air defense and anti-ship systems."" US, European and Ukrainian officials have been sounding the alarm for weeks over a major Russian troop buildup near the Ukrainian border that Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned could be a ""rehash"" of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014.

Putin's comments, released by state TV on Sunday, are likely to further fuel speculation about his foreign policy intentions among critics, who accuse him of planning to recreate the Soviet Union and of contemplating an attack on Ukraine, a notion the Kremlin has dismissed as fear-mongering. ""It was a disintegration of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union,"" Putin said of the 1991 breakup, in comments aired on Sunday as part of a documentary film called ""Russia. New History,"" the RIA state news agency reported. ""We turned into a completely different country. And what had been built up over 1,000 years was largely lost,"" said Putin, saying 25 million Russian people in newly independent countries suddenly found themselves cut off from Russia, part of what he called ""a major humanitarian tragedy."" Putin also described for the first time how he was affected personally by the tough economic times that followed the Soviet collapse, when Russia suffered double-digit inflation. ""Sometimes (I) had to moonlight and drive a taxi. It is unpleasant to talk about this but, unfortunately, this also took place,"" the president said. Putin, who served in the Soviet-era KGB, has previously called the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was ruled from Moscow, as the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the 20th century, but his new comments show how he viewed it specifically as a setback for Russian power. Ukraine was one of 15 Soviet republics and Putin used a lengthy article published on the Kremlin website this year to set out why he believed Russia's southern neighbor and its people were an integral part of Russian history and culture. This view is rejected by Kiev as a politically motivated and over-simplified version of history. The West has accused Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine in preparation for a possible attack as soon as January. The Group of Seven wealthy democracies warned Moscow on Sunday of massive consequences and severe costs if it attacked Ukraine. The Kremlin has said Russia has no plans to launch a fresh attack on Ukraine and that the West appears to have convinced itself of Moscow's aggressive intentions based on what it calls false Western media stories.

According to its latest ongoing security assessment -- shared with CNN by Ukrainian security sources -- the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said ""combat and other military equipment, such as tanks, armed vehicles and 'Iskander' missiles remain near the border of Ukraine,"" following numerous Russian military exercises. Russia regularly ""redeploys and accumulates its military units to maintain tension in the region,"" the assessment said, allowing it to ""create striking forces rapidly, and lays the ground for quick reinforcement."" Months of steady military increases along the Russia-Ukraine frontier have alarmed Ukrainian and Western officials. CNN reported last week that Russian forces had capabilities in place along the Ukrainian border to carry out a swift and immediate invasion, including erecting supply lines such as medical units and fuel that could sustain a drawn-out conflict. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the suggestion that Russia would invade Ukraine as ""provocative."" ""Russia is pursuing a peaceful foreign policy. But it has the right to ensure its safety,"" he said during a televised news conference on Wednesday, emphasizing the Kremlin's concern at the prospect of Ukraine one day joining NATO. In a virtual meeting Tuesday that turned tense at times, US President Joe Biden warned Putin about invading Ukraine, and Washington is preparing a series of harsh economic sanctions in the event that Russian forces do attack. Biden ended the conversation without any further clarity on whether Putin had made up his mind to launch an invasion, US officials said afterward. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov on Monday said the build-up of Russian troops was an attempt to spread fear and unrest in Ukraine, and to prevent Kiev from moving closer toward NATO and membership of the European Union. ""This gathering of their troops alongside of our border, it's a main goal of them to make destabilization process inside of our country, to stop us in our way. But we go into the NATO ally, we're going to EU,"" Reznikov told CNN. According to the latest Ukrainian assessment, Russia is also stepping up operations from the neighboring country of Belarus, which borders Ukraine to the north. The report said some units of the Russian army remain near the Russian border with Belarus ""at the distance of around 260 km (160 miles) from the state border of Ukraine."" Russia has also intensified its intelligence gathering on Ukraine, the report added, with the number of reconnaissance aircraft flights along the Ukrainian border, above the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, tripling since the same period last year. Biden on Wednesday ruled out sending US troops to defend Ukraine in case of a military escalation, though the United States will send small arms and ammunition to Ukrainian defense forces this week as part of a $60 million security assistance package approved earlier this year, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to speak with Biden on Thursday.",4,3.491348623366145,2.7301436570602737,0.7612049663058711,16
2021-12-09,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/us-ukraine-security-assistance-military-training/index.html,US small arms and ammo arrive in Ukraine as Pentagon details troops to train country's military,"Part of a $60 million security assistance package, including small arms and ammunition, was delivered to Ukraine on Thursday, according to a State Department official in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, but a final delivery containing four counter mortar radars is still scheduled for early next year. President Joe Biden approved the package on September 1 as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House. The assistance included lethal elements, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, as well as nonlethal elements, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday. The security package is designed to bolster Ukraine's self-defense capability, especially in light of the buildup of Russian forces near the country's borders. The US has watched the movements with growing concern, and US officials have been in touch with their NATO and European counterparts to coordinate a response should Russian President Vladimir Putin decide to invade Ukraine. This year, the US has delivered approximately $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine, Kirby said, including the elements arriving this week. Since 2014, when Russia invaded and occupied the Crimean peninsula, the US has provided more than $2.5 billion in aid to Ukraine. On Tuesday, Biden warned Putin, in a virtual meeting that turned tense at times, about invading Ukraine, and the administration is preparing a series of harsh economic sanctions in the event that Russian forces do attack. The US military also helps to train Ukrainian forces. In November, about 150 members of the Florida National Guard's Task Force Gator deployed to Ukraine as part of the Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine, replacing the Washington National Guard. The training group, established in 2015, was designed to improve Ukraine's defensive capabilities. In addition to Task Force Gator, Special Operations Command Europe has a ""large role"" in training and advising Ukrainian special forces through exercises, communication and coordination ""at every echelon,"" the Pentagon said in a statement Tuesday. The Pentagon did not disclose how many special forces were in Ukraine because of operational security concerns. ""Training with our Ukrainian partners cultivates trust, fortifies readiness, and develops relationships, which in turn promotes peace and stability throughout Europe,"" Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth said in the statement. The Pentagon would not go into detail about timelines for training, operations or deployments, nor would it say if any schedules have changed in light of the buildup of Russian forces near Ukraine. Marines from Europe and the region operate throughout the continent for training and exercises, the Pentagon said, and thousands of Marines from II Marine Expeditionary Force will take part next year in the biannual Cold Response exercise in Norway. US Army Europe and Africa trains in Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Germany, the Netherlands and Greece, while the 4th Security Force Assistance Brigade has rotational teams in Georgia, Latvia, North Macedonia, Poland and Romania. The Florida National Guard's 164th Air Defense Artillery Brigade is in Ansbach, Germany.

2021-12-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/biden-putin-us-troops/index.html,Biden says US troops in Ukraine are off the table but promises withering sanctions if Russia invades,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine to defend the country from a Russian invasion a day after laying out the consequences for such an incursion during a stern phone call with President Vladimir Putin. It was Biden's first time describing Tuesday's two-hour conversation, which officials said grew tense at moments as the two men sparred over the massive build-up of 70,000 Russian troops surrounding Ukraine on three sides. Biden ended the conversation without any further clarity on whether Putin had made up his mind to launch an invasion, officials said afterward. But a day later, both he and Putin said new diplomatic channels could soon be opened in an attempt to provide an off-ramp to conflict. Speaking to reporters as he departed the White House for Kansas City, Biden said he warned Putin he would impose sanctions ""like none he's ever seen"" should the Russian troops massed on Ukraine's border escalate into an assault. But he said the US would not dispatch its own forces to protect Ukraine, a stance that US officials have previously ruled out as well. ""That is not on the table,"" he said. ""We have a moral obligation and a legal obligation to our NATO allies if they were to attack under Article 5, that's a sacred obligation. That obligation does not extend to ... Ukraine."" Instead, Biden said he told Putin in direct terms that the economic consequences of an incursion would be devastating. ""I was very straightforward. There were no minced words. I was polite but I made it very clear: If, in fact, he invades Ukraine, there will be severe consequences. Severe consequences. Economic consequences like none he's ever seen or ever have been seen, in terms of being imposed,"" Biden said. He said he believed his Russian counterpart received the message. ""He knows. His immediate response was he understood that,"" Biden said. American officials have previewed a lengthy set of possible sanctions on Russia, including on members of Putin's inner circle and the country's energy sector, as options for Biden as he moves ahead. The President has been coordinating with allies in Europe -- whose countries are tied more closely to Russia economically -- on a joint sanctions effort. The consequences of an invasion would go beyond sanctions, however. Biden said he told Putin he would likely have to increase US troop presence in Europe to reassure NATO allies of the United States' continued support if Russia went ahead with an invasion. Putin has long complained about the presence of NATO troops along Russia's border, alleging they are a threat to his country's security. Ukraine has been seeking membership in NATO for several years, but is not in the final stages of entering the defense bloc. Biden has said previously the country must first do more to scrub out corruption before joining. In Tuesday's video call, Putin asked for legally binding language that would prevent Ukraine's ascension to NATO, a red line Biden would not agree to. But he did agree to hear out Putin's concerns about NATO in a diplomatic format and said Wednesday those talks were likely to begin soon. ""We hope by Friday we'll be able to say, to announce to you that we're having meetings at a higher level, not just with us but with at least four major NATO allies and Russia, to discuss the future of Russia's concerns relative to NATO writ large and whether or not we can work out any accommodations when it comes to bringing down the temperature along the eastern front,"" he said. Speaking during his own televised news conference on Wednesday, Putin said he and Biden agreed to continue the security discussions and said Russia would submit parameters for the talks to the United States within a week. ""We agreed that an appropriate structure will be created that will be able to professionally deal with this,"" Putin said during an appearance in Sochi, the Black Sea resort town from which he participated in Tuesday's video call with Biden. ""The conversation was very open, substantive and constructive. I hope that this is how the American side assesses the results as well. We have the opportunity to continue the dialogue, and I think this is the most important thing,"" he said.

2021-12-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/07/politics/us-citizens-evacuation-ukraine/index.html,Biden administration considering options for possibly evacuating US citizens from Ukraine if Russia invades,"The Biden administration is exploring options for a potential evacuation of US citizens from Ukraine if Russia were to invade the country and create a dire security situation, half a dozen sources tell CNN. The contingency planning is being led by the Pentagon, the sources said, and comes as the administration briefs Congress on how the US is preparing. In a ""gloomy"" briefing to senators by senior State Department official Victoria Nuland on Monday night, Nuland outlined the tough sanctions package being prepared by the administration in response to a potential Russian attack, but acknowledged that the US' options to deter an invasion are fairly limited, a person familiar with the briefing said. It is still unclear whether Russian President Vladimir Putin has made the decision to invade, US officials stressed. But he has amassed enough forces, equipment and supplies near Ukraine's borders that he could move to attack on very short notice. The administration does not currently see a need for evacuations, the sources stressed —airlines are still operating from Ukraine's international airports and land borders to Ukraine's western neighbors are open. The discussions are part of planning in the event the security situation severely deteriorates, multiple officials involved in the planning emphasized. ""The Department of Defense is a planning organization and must be ready for any manner of contingencies around the world. We do a lot of thinking about a lot of scenarios. But there is no demand signal for civilian evacuations in Ukraine, and it would be wrong to conclude that there is an active effort in the Pentagon to prepare for them,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement. In a tweet, the US Embassy in Kyiv said, ""The U.S. government is not currently considering evacuations of U.S. government personnel or American citizens from Ukraine. We are conducting normal contingency planning, as we always do, in the event the security situation severely deteriorates."" The Defense Department and State Department have plans ready for worst-case scenarios in countries around the world, and plans are updated and changed in light of the situation on the ground. But an evacuation of diplomatic staff from Ukraine remains very unlikely. Even if Ukraine is not a NATO member, the White House sees the country as a key Eastern European ally, and there is a strategic benefit in the presence of US diplomats and training forces in Ukraine. That makes a drawdown of the US footprint there far less likely than, for example, the drawdown of US diplomats and troops in Afghanistan. Kyiv, which is the only city where the US has a diplomatic presence in Ukraine, is hundreds of miles from Crimea or the Ukraine-Russia border, where Moscow has built up forces. Such a move would be a propaganda win for Putin, sending a message that the Russian leader can influence the US' policies and diplomatic presence in Ukraine. But the deliberations reflect how seriously the administration is taking the potential for an invasion. President Joe Biden is speaking with Putin on Tuesday morning amid the heightened tensions. Right now, the Pentagon is planning for a number of different scenarios in the event that an evacuation is necessary, ranging from a smaller evacuation of just nonessential US government employees to a larger one involving a broader swath of American citizens, the sources said. The State Department would be responsible for ultimately determining whether an evacuation operation is necessary. Right now some planning is underway by the State Department's diplomatic security for either an authorized or ordered departure of diplomats from the country should the situation warrant it, a source familiar with the discussions said. ""We don't know that Putin has made up his mind to use force, but what we do know is that he's putting the Russian military, the Russian security forces in a place where they could act in a pretty sweeping way,"" CIA Director Bill Burns said at a Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit on Monday. Administration wants to avoid getting caught 'flat-footed' Several sources noted that the flurry of planning comes on the heels of the massive US evacuation from Afghanistan, which lawmakers criticized as poorly planned after images surfaced showing chaos at the Kabul airport. The US does not want to be caught ""flat-footed"" in the event of an unexpected invasion, said one source familiar with the matter. The military has similar contingency planning in place for US personnel stationed in Ethiopia, where an ongoing conflict between rebel groups and the central government has continued to deteriorate. Still, officials emphasized that any potential evacuation in Ukraine likely would not resemble the massive US effort to evacuate all American citizens from Afghanistan earlier this year. Nuland, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, said Tuesday that a range of 10 to 15,000 Americans are currently in Ukraine -- a number that tends to fluctuate around Christmas time, as more people visit. ""If we are concerned about imminent hostilities in Ukraine, we will begin warning US citizens as we do all around the world ... that it's time for them to find their way home,"" Nuland said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead."" Typically, if a security situation deteriorates, the US Embassy increases its messaging to US citizens to advise them to leave the country on commercial flights, and will offer assistance for those who are not able to afford to do so. The US Embassy in Kyiv has not issued any new advisories urging American citizens to consider leaving Ukraine. The last security alert was issued in late November, advising US citizens ""of concerning reports of unusual Russian military activity near Ukraine's borders and in occupied Crimea."" ""U.S. citizens are reminded the security conditions along the border may change with little or no notice,"" it said. The State Department has long warned US citizens against traveling to Crimea because of the conflict — and the entire country is currently at a Level 4: Do Not Travel advisory due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Some sources cautioned that any evacuation effort from Ukraine — if done under military pressure from Russia — would be a massively complex logistical challenge. A recent US intelligence assessment found that Russia could be preparing to invade as early as next month with as many as 175,000 troops from positions near Ukraine's southern, western, and northeastern borders. On Capitol Hill, and in some corners of the Pentagon, pressure is building for the United States to provide new Javelin anti-tank and anti-armor missiles to Ukraine — something that almost certainly would not make a strategic difference to Ukraine's ability to fend off a full-scale invasion by Russia, but might buy some time. NATO allies ""have met and will continue to meet to determine from the full range of political and military tools available what they wish to do,"" a senior western intelligence official told CNN in a recent interview. The US is also taking steps to plan for additional US troop deployments in Europe on NATO's eastern flank to help reassure allies of continued American support in the event of an invasion, a senior administration official said on Monday. ""I think you could anticipate that in the event of an invasion, the need to reinforce the confidence and reassurances of our NATO allies and our eastern flank allies would be real. And the United States would be prepared to provide that reassurance,"" the official said.

2021-12-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/07/politics/nuland-sfrc-us-russia-ukraine/index.html,"Russian military capacity on Ukraine's border is on a 'more lethal scale' than 2014 Crimea invasion, US official says","Russian President Vladimir Putin has built military capacity on the border of Ukraine that is ""much larger and on a much more lethal scale"" than preceded Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea, Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland said Tuesday, warning of severe risks to Moscow if it invades Ukraine. Moscow has positioned approximately 100 tactical groups and nearly all its ready ground forces based west of the Urals at different spots along its border with Ukraine, Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Much of this comes right out of Putin's 2014 playbook,"" Nuland said, ""but this time, it is much larger and on a much more lethal scale."" Speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead"" after her Senate appearance, Nuland also said Russia now has forces on three sides of Ukraine, ""which is not a scenario we've seen before."" Nuland, in that appearance later Tuesday, said Russia might use Belarus to invade Ukraine and perhaps ""mask"" its forces to look like Belarusian troops, a point she had emphasized in the Senate hearing as well. ""What we have not yet seen, but which we could see, are Russian forces coming down toward Ukraine from Belarus or, as I said today, masking as fellow Belarusian forces,"" Nuland told Tapper. ""We've seen the increasing dependence that Belarusian President (Alexander) Lukashanko has on Putin, so Putin could demand that he return the favor."" In the Senate hearing, Nuland told Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, that ""it was particularly concerning to see President Lukashenko make a change in his own posture with regard to Crimea. He had long declined to recognize Russia's claim on Crimea, but he changed tack a week ago, which is concerning."" Nuland said that if Putin does take military action against Ukraine, the response from the US and allies won't resemble their reaction after Russia's invasion of Crimea. This time, the US and its allies will respond differently to any military action against Ukraine, Nuland said. While she declined to offer specific examples in an open hearing, she said the US and European allies ""will be united in imposing severe consequences on Moscow for its actions, including high impact economic measures that we have refrained from using in the past."" 'Extremely significant' Unlike the sanctions pursued in 2014, which escalated somewhat gradually, ""this time the intent is to make clear that the initial sanctions in response to any further aggressive moves in Ukraine will be extremely significant and isolating for Russia and for Russian business and for the Russian people."" She added that ""none of us seeks confrontation or crisis. Certainly, the Russian people don't need it."" Nuland testified hours after President Joe Biden spoke by secure video call with Putin to outline potential sanctions and other ramifications should the Russian leader move militarily against Ukraine. The two-hour call was just the latest diplomatic outreach meant to avoid war on European soil. After a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Thursday in Stockholm, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that the US and European allies are ""deeply concerned by evidence that Russia has made plans for significant aggressive moves against Ukraine, including efforts to destabilize Ukraine from within and large-scale military operations."" Nuland said diplomatic outreach to Ukrainian officials is ""ongoing at every level"" and that Defense Department officials are having ""pretty fulsome"" conversations with their Ukrainian counterparts. Biden is set to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later Tuesday or Wednesday, she said, following a call Blinken made to Zelensky on Monday after his meeting with Ukraine's foreign minister in Stockholm. ""We've had the defense minister, the foreign minister, the national security adviser in Washington,"" Nuland noted. ""And we have a very robust team in the embassy and our advisers in Kiev now."" A recent US intelligence assessment found that the Kremlin could begin an offensive involving up to 175,000 troops staged at different points along the border with Ukraine. CNN has reported that Russia has staged enough forces, equipment and supplies, including medical units and fuel, near Ukraine's borders to sustain a drawn-out conflict. CIA Director Bill Burns said Monday that with those pieces in place, Putin is able to act swiftly. ""We don't know that Putin has made up his mind to use force, but what we do know is that he's putting the Russian military, the Russian security forces in a place where they could act in a pretty sweeping way,"" Burns told the Wall Street Journal CEO Summit. Planting the seeds Nuland said that Putin is planting seeds of disinformation within Russia, using claims that the country is under threat from Ukraine to ""prepare the ground in his own body politic."" She emphasized the need for US officials to convey to the Russian people what's at stake. ""I think it's important that not just President Putin, as he got the message very clearly from President Biden today, but that the Russian people also appreciate the kinds of things that are being contemplated and the kind of risk that their President is potentially taking them into, including for their sons and daughters who serve,"" Nuland said. The undersecretary and senators of both parties also warned that the Russian leader may be underestimating changes that have taken place in Ukraine since 2014. ""If Putin invades Ukraine, the implications will be devastating for the Russian economy, but also for the Russian people,"" said Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat. ""Ukrainian military forces of 2021 are not the Ukrainian military forces of 2014. They are well equipped thanks to the United States and our allies. They are well trained. They have years of combat experience and most importantly, they have every incentive to fight."" Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, later offered his own assessment. ""Russian blood will be spilled and there will be Russians going home in body bags if (Putin) invades this country,"" he said.

Reznikov urged US President Joe Biden -- who was set to speak with Vladimir Putin of Russia in a video conference call on Tuesday -- to stand firm against Moscow. ""If I can advise President Biden, I would like him to articulate to Mr. Putin that no red lines from the Kremlin side should be here. The red line is here in Ukraine and the civilized world will react without hesitation,"" Reznikov told CNN in an exclusive interview Monday. ""The idea of not provoking Russia will not work,"" he added. US and Western officials have expressed concern over the buildup of Russian forces on the Ukrainian border, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying last week that the US ""must prepare for all contingencies."" Russia has capabilities in place along the Ukraine border to carry out a swift and immediate invasion, including erecting supply lines such as medical units and fuel that could sustain a drawn-out conflict, should Moscow choose to invade, two sources familiar with American intelligence assessments told CNN last week. Reznikov told CNN that Ukraine assesses that Russia currently has 95,000 troops within striking distance of Ukraine. He also added that, due to the strength of battle-hardened Ukrainian forces, current US estimates that Russia could assemble 175,000 troops to invade Ukraine were an underestimate. ""So, we have 250,000 official ... members of our army. Plus, I said 400,000 veterans and 200,000 reservists. 175,000 (is) not enough to go to Ukraine,"" said Reznikov. Reznikov stressed that a Russian invasion -- if it happens -- would have ""disastrous"" consequences for the whole of European continent, with an estimated 4 to 5 million Ukrainians possibly needing to seek refuge in Europe. Reznikov also underlined that Ukraine is a major food supplier to Europe and Africa, supplies which he said would be disrupted. The minister said that the Ukrainian army has sent a request for further military equipment aid from its allies, including material support and training for its air force and navy. ""We don't need troops, because I think it's not so fair that American soldiers will die in Ukraine. No, we don't need it,"" added Reznikov. Ukraine has warned for weeks that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion, with NATO pointing out that Russian movements near the border have been unusual. Western powers have repeatedly urged Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. On the Kremlin's motives, Reznikov told CNN he believed the Russia's saber-rattling was aimed at spreading fear and unrest in Ukraine, and at preventing Ukraine from moving closer toward NATO and EU membership. The Kremlin is demanding a legal commitment that NATO will not be expanded eastwards to include Ukraine and that NATO military infrastructure, like missile systems, will not be built up in the country. ""If we share or spread panic in our country and inside of our society, it will be the gift to the Kremlin, because they trying to do that. Because this gathering of their troops alongside of our border, it's a main goal of them to make destabilization process inside of our country, to stop us in our way.

2021-12-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/06/politics/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-call-on-ukraine/index.html,Biden faces high-stakes test in call with Putin over Ukraine,"President Joe Biden is set for one of the most critical calls of his presidency on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as he gets stark warnings from the US intelligence community that Russia is preparing to invade Ukraine as soon as next month. Amid ""deep concern"" about Russia's planning for ""significant military action against Ukraine,"" the President will not entertain any of Putin's ""red lines"" on NATO expansion in Eastern Europe and will make clear that the US is prepared to respond to an invasion with sanctions and -- if needed -- additional troops in Europe to reassure nervous allies, a senior administration official told reporters on Monday. The call comes nearly six months after Biden met Putin for the first time as president in Geneva, Switzerland, when he hoped to calm tensions by finding areas where the US and Russia could cooperate like cybersecurity and strategic arms control. The two men have a long history, and Biden has said explicitly he does not hold Putin in particularly high regard. After a meeting with Putin in 2011, then-Vice President Biden said he looked into Putin's eyes and declared: ""I don't think you have a soul."" During an interview in March, Biden called Putin a killer, saying that the Russian leader ""will pay a price"" for his efforts to undermine the 2020 US election. And although the June summit was cordial, the Russian military's recent escalations show the meeting did not produce the kind of ""stable and predictable"" relationship the US was hoping for. The relationship took a dramatic turn last month when US officials began to sound the alarm about irregular Russian military movements near the Ukraine border. Russia has now amassed nearly 100,000 troops near the border, US Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville said last weekend, and has also erected supply lines in the area such as medical units and fuel that could sustain a drawn-out conflict, sources told CNN. A US intelligence assessment found that Russia could be preparing to invade as early as next month with as many as 175,000 troops from positions near Ukraine's southern, western, and northeastern borders. Officials report a ""significant spike"" in Russian disinformation operations characterizing the Ukrainian government as illegitimate, and US officials have also shared with senior Ukrainian officials evidence that Russia -- through the FSB, Russia's successor to the KGB -- is engaging in destabilizing activities inside Ukraine to foment dissent against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration. Senior administration officials say Biden -- who had the Ukraine portfolio as Barack Obama's vice president and has made half a dozen trips there -- is realistic about what he can achieve directly with Putin. But in Biden's view, any conversation is better than silence, and he believes Putin responds to directness and strength. When he sits down in the White House's Situation Room on Tuesday to conduct the secure video call, he plans to lay out in detailed terms the ways Russia would be punished if an invasion goes forward. Those penalties include ""substantive economic countermeasures"" meant to inflict ""significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy,"" the senior official said, in coordination with European allies. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Matthew Chance, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov urged Biden to stand firm against Moscow. ""If I can advise President Biden, I would like him to articulate to Mr. Putin that no red lines from the Kremlin side should be here. The red line is here in Ukraine and the civilized world will react without hesitation,"" Reznikov said. ""The idea of not provoking Russia will not work,"" he added. Despite the military escalations, it is still unclear whether Putin has made a final decision to invade Ukraine, and some officials have speculated that the buildup could be a way for Russia to leverage concessions from the West. Putin is expected to demand Biden make a binding guarantee that will ""exclude any further NATO expansion eastward and the deployment of weapons systems that would threaten us on the territories of neighboring countries, including Ukraine,"" Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters last week. Asked on Monday about Russia's demands for a binding pledge from NATO not to expand further east, however, the senior official said, ""We don't think talk of red lines is helpful, and as the President has said, we're not going to operate according to that logic of accepting anyone's red lines."" Many US officials, meanwhile, believe Russia is just using discussions about NATO encroachment as an excuse to attack Ukraine, knowing that Biden and other western officials will not accept Putin's demands ""Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month, referring to Russia's invasion of Crimea. Blinken spoke to Zelensky on Monday and Biden will speak to Zelensky in the coming days to brief him on the call with Putin, the official said. Weighing a response The US and its European and NATO allies have been weighing a number of measures to deter a Russian attack, including sending military advisers and new weaponry to Ukraine. The US is also taking steps to plan for additional US troop deployments in Europe on NATO's eastern flank to help reassure allies of continued American support, the senior official said. ""I think you could anticipate that in the event of an invasion, the need to reinforce the confidence and reassurances of our NATO allies and our eastern flank allies would be real. And the United States would be prepared to provide that reassurance,"" this person said. ""We are working through the prudent planning of what we would have to do in the event of such an escalation and how we would have to ensure the security of our NATO allies in that context."" ""Aggressive"" new sanctions against members of Putin's inner circle and on Russian energy producers are also being considered, people familiar with the discussions said. The new economic sanctions could target a variety of sectors, including energy producers, Russian banks and Russia's sovereign debt, the people said. There is also serious discussion underway about denying Russian energy producers from debt markets should they invade Ukraine, a senior US official told CNN. ""We have put together a pretty damn aggressive package,"" another senior US official said. This person added that the US has warned Russia that if it invades Ukraine the US and Europe together will impose the worst economic sanctions that have ever been imposed on a country, outside of Iran and North Korea. Officials are also weighing cutting off Russia from the SWIFT international payment system should it move forward with an invasion, sources said, but that would be a ""nuclear"" option. To some Ukrainians, the potential measures are not enough. An adviser to Zelensky told CNN that imposing sanctions only after Russia moves to invade would be futile, and that at least some penalties should be imposed preemptively to get Russia to back off. ""The view from Kyiv is that any prospective sanctions should Putin invade have already been factored in by Moscow and provide close to zero deterrence value,"" the adviser said. ""However, the imposition of strong sanctions now — with roll back provisions built into them should Russia take real steps to de-escalate — have a chance to work.""",4,1.4815292830225821,1.1269512393093082,0.35457804371327395,20
2021-12-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/04/politics/russia-ukraine-troops-border-us-intelligence-reports/index.html,"US intelligence estimates Russian troop levels on Ukraine border could reach 175,000","New US intelligence findings estimate Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine in a matter of months as it amasses up to 175,000 troops along the border, a startling escalation that President Joe Biden has warned could lead to severe consequences. The latest developments come after months of steady increases along the Russia-Ukraine frontier that have alarmed US and Western officials and led to tense conversations between American diplomats and their counterparts. CNN reported Friday that Russian forces have capabilities in place along the Ukraine border to carry out a swift and immediate invasion, including erecting supply lines such as medical units and fuel that could sustain a drawn-out conflict, should Moscow choose to invade. Officials said the current levels of equipment stationed in the area could supply front-line forces for seven to 10 days and other support units for as long as a month. The intelligence findings, first reported by the Washington Post and described by an administration official, say Russia could begin the offensive ""as soon as early 2022"" with 100 battalion tactical groups, which is twice the scale of forces Russia built up in the region last spring. Half those units are currently near Ukraine's border, the intelligence finds. The official said the determination was based on images over the last month. US Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville said Saturday that ""somewhere around 95,000 to 100,000 Russian soldiers"" were on the border of Ukraine. ""I don't know what they're going to do. But I am very, very concerned about their posture, and it's in the news,"" McConville said, while speaking on a panel at the Reagan National Defense Forum. ""That gives a lot of options to the Russians, and I'm not quite sure what they're going to do. But to me, that is a terrible ... It's going to have a terrible impact on the stability and security of our European friends, and so I have serious concerns about that."" McConville's statement is thought to be the first on-the-record acknowledgment of reports of the troop levels by the US military. The build-up has led to a planned ""secure video call"" on Tuesday between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Saturday. ""The leaders will discuss a range of topics in the U.S.-Russia relationship, including strategic stability, cyber, and regional issues,"" Psaki said. ""President Biden will underscore U.S. concerns with Russian military activities on the border with Ukraine and reaffirm the United States' support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."" Asked as he departed the White House on Friday evening about the intelligence findings, Biden voiced deep concerns. ""We've been aware of Russia's actions for a long time,"" he said as he left for Camp David. ""My expectation is we're going to have a long discussion with Putin."" The intelligence also suggests Russia has suddenly established a reserve of contract troops that would be mobilized in the event of a Ukrainian offensive. In addition to the military buildup, the intelligence suggests a Russian influence campaign meant to denigrate Ukraine's leaders and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has been warning against a Russian offensive. ""Recent information also indicates that Russian officials proposed adjusting Russia's information operations against Ukraine to emphasize the narrative that Ukrainian leaders had been installed by the West, harbored a hatred for the 'Russian world,' and were acting against the interests of the Ukrainian people,"" the administration official said. On Friday, Biden warned he would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Putin to take military action in Ukraine, describing ""the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives"" to deter the Russia leader from going ahead with an invasion. US officials have said that could include new sanctions, including on wealthy Russians in Putin's inner circle, and increased military assistance to Ukraine. A National Security Council spokesperson, discussing the latest intelligence, said the US is ""deeply concerned by evidence that Russia is stepping up its planning for significant military action against Ukraine."" ""The Biden administration has been consistent in our message to Russia: the United States does not seek conflict, and the best way to avert a crisis and a negative spiral in the broader relationship is through diplomacy and de-escalation,"" the NSC spokesperson said. Speaking in Parliament on Friday, the Ukrainian defense minister described Russia using waves of military buildups as a tactic, amassing its troops near Ukraine's borders and then pulling them back to their permanent bases, leaving the equipment behind -- thereby reducing the time needed for deployment. ""In April and September this year, Russia pulled than 50 battalion tactical groups to our borders. Currently, 41 battalion tactical groups are in combat readiness around Ukraine and in the temporarily occupied Crimea. Of these, 33 stay on a permanent basis and eight have been additionally transferred to Crimea. The total number of troops in Russia, as well as in the temporarily occupied territories, which may be used for escalation, is now estimated at 94,300 people,"" Oleksii Reznikov said.",4,0.7370329908215127,1.5268620477130703,-0.7898290568915576,7
2021-12-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/03/europe/ukraine-russia-2021-tensions-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html,Tensions are high on Ukraine's border with Russia. Here's what you need to know,"Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with a Russian troop build-up near the two nations' borders spurring fears that Moscow could launch an invasion. Ukraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. The picture is complicated -- but here's a breakdown of what we know. What's the situation on the border? The United States and NATO have described the movements and concentrations of troops in and around Ukraine as ""unusual."" As many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine ""as soon as early 2022."" Speaking alongside his Ukrainian counterpart on January 19, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had ""ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine's border, which it could double on relatively short order."" In late 2021, satellite photos revealed Russian hardware -- including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles -- on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300 km) from the border. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest intelligence assessment says Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops near Ukraine, including air and naval forces, transferred more Iskander operational-tactical missiles to the border, and increased its intelligence activity against the country. The assessment came after three rounds of diplomatic talks between Russia and the West aimed at de-escalating the crisis failed to produce a resolution. US officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two. Many of Russia's military bases are to the west of the vast country -- the direction from which history suggests any threats are most likely to come. Russia's Defense Ministry said on December 1 that it had started ""regular"" winter military drills in its southern region, parts of which border Ukraine. The exercises involve more than 10,000 troops, the ministry said. Meanwhile, Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia, an area known as Donbas, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian forces are also present in the area, referred to by Ukraine as ""temporarily occupied territories,"" although Russia denies it. The front lines of the conflict have barely moved in five years, but there are frequent small-scale clashes and sniper attacks. Russia was angered when Ukrainian forces deployed a Turkish-made combat drone for the first time in October to strike a position held by the pro-Russian separatists. Russia also has forces numbering in the tens of thousands at its massive naval base in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014. The Crimean peninsula, which lies to the south of the rest of Ukraine, is now connected by a road bridge to mainland Russia. What's the history of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia? Tensions between Ukraine and Russia, both former Soviet states, escalated in late 2013 over a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. After the pro-Russian then-President, Viktor Yanukovych, suspended the talks -- reportedly under pressure from Moscow -- weeks of protests in Kiev erupted into violence. Then, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, an autonomous peninsula in southern Ukraine with strong Russian loyalties, on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian-speaking citizens. First, thousands of Russian-speaking troops, dubbed ""little green men"" and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the Crimean peninsula. Within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate. Shortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence from Kiev, prompting months of heavy fighting. Despite Kiev and Moscow signing a peace deal in Minsk in 2015, brokered by France and Germany, there have been repeated ceasefire violations. According to UN figures, there have been more than 3,000 conflict-related civilian deaths in eastern Ukraine since March 2014. The European Union and US have imposed a series of measures in response to Russia's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including economic sanctions targeting individuals, entities and specific sectors of the Russian economy. The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of stirring up tensions in the country's east and of violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement. What's Russia's view? The Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans on invading Ukraine, insisting Russia does not pose a threat to anyone and that the country moving troops across its own territory should not be cause for alarm. Moscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO -- in terms of weaponry, training and personnel -- as a threat to its own security. It has also accused Ukraine of boosting its own troop numbers in preparation for an attempt to retake the Donbas region, an allegation Ukraine has denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia's borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances. Putin has also said that NATO deploying sophisticated weapons in Ukraine, such as missile systems, would be crossing a ""red line"" for Russia, amid concern in Moscow that Ukraine is being increasingly armed by NATO powers. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in November that weapons and military advisers were already being supplied to Ukraine by the US and other NATO member states. ""And all this, of course, leads to a further aggravation of the situation on the border line,"" he said. If the US and its NATO allies do not change course in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that Moscow has the ""right to choose ways to ensure its legitimate security interests."" What is Ukraine's view? Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kiev from building closer ties with NATO if it chooses. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN, in response to Russian calls for NATO to halt its eastward expansion. ""Any Russian proposals to discuss with NATO or the US any so-called guarantees that the Alliance would not expand to the East are illegitimate,"" it added. Ukraine insists Russia is seeking to destabilize the country with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, recently saying a coup plot, involving Ukrainians and Russians, had been uncovered. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that a planned coup could be part of Russia's plan ahead of a military invasion. ""External military pressure goes hand in hand with domestic destabilization of the country,"" he said. Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kiev believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. At the same time, Zelensky's government faces challenges on many fronts. The government's popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy. Many people are also unhappy that the government hasn't yet delivered on benefits it promised and ended the conflict in the country's east. Anti-government protests have taken place in Kiev. What does NATO say? NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said ""there will be a high price to pay for Russia"" if it once again invades Ukraine, a NATO partner. ""We have a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions,"" said Stoltenberg, in a December 1 interview with CNN. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO increased its defenses ""with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia ... but also in the Black Sea region,"" Stoltenberg said. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and therefore doesn't have the same security guarantees as NATO members. But Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that it cannot pursue NATO membership. NATO was set to hold crunch talks with Russia on January 12 in Geneva, following discussions with diplomats from Ukraine and the US, in an attempt to avert an invasion. Stoltenberg said on January 10 that Moscow still had ""tens of thousands of combat ready troops"" close the border with Ukraine, but welcomed the Kremlin's willingness to meet. What does the United States say? President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a January 2022 phone call that the US and its allies ""will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine."" The two spoke just a few days after Biden urged Putin to ease the crisis on the border, and before Russian and US officials are set to meet in person in Geneva later this month. Two defense officials told CNN on January 3 that the Defense Department has developed military options for Biden if he decides to increase capabilities in eastern Europe to further deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine. Both officials emphasized that this part of routine planning the military does and that for now, the focus remains on diplomacy and potential economic sanctions. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov held meetings in Geneva on January 10, as the US sought to de-escalate the threat of a Russian advance. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also warned Russia that ""any renewed aggression can trigger serious consequences."" The US delivered roughly $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine in 2021, the Pentagon said, including a package of small arms and ammunition in December. The Biden administration has also weighed sending military advisers and new equipment, including more substantial weaponry, to Ukraine to prepare for a possible invasion, sources familiar with the deliberations told CNN in November. The Obama administration was taken by surprise when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.

2021-12-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/03/politics/russian-forces-ukraine-border/index.html,"Russia positions more forces, supply lines as fears rise of potential Ukraine invasion","Russian forces have capabilities in place along the Ukraine border to carry out a swift and immediate invasion, including erecting supply lines such as medical units and fuel that could sustain a drawn-out conflict, should Moscow choose to invade, two sources familiar with the latest intelligence assessments told CNN. The new details about the Russian buildup underscore US officials' heightened alarm over the movements. The current levels of equipment stationed in the area could supply front-line forces for seven to 10 days and other support units for as long as a month, according to one source familiar with the matter. Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN that he believes Russia is positioned to invade ""when they want,"" adding that ""Russia's capabilities would be equivalent to a modern-day blitzkrieg."" A senior administration official told CNN that the US has ""seen additional Russia troops added to the border region in recent days,"" but the source declined to detail how many troops. It is still unclear whether Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to invade or whether the buildup is a game of brinkmanship to get concessions from the West, officials said. But the apparent military readiness has raised alarms among Western officials, who say Russia is positioning itself to be able to launch an attack on very short notice. ""We don't know whether President Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know that he is putting in place the capacity to do so on short order should he so decide,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Latvia on Wednesday. ""We must prepare for all contingencies."" A senior Western intelligence official similarly said Russia is trying to ""set the stage to be ready to conduct a fairly large-scale operation"" into Ukraine in an effort to coerce Kiev away from its drift into the Western European and NATO orbit. Russia has denied in recent days that it has any plans to attack Ukraine but has also demanded security guarantees from the West, such as a pledge that it won't allow Ukraine to join NATO. ""So if NATO still refuses to discuss this theme or the guarantees or ideas put forward by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, of course we will take measures to ensure that our security, our sovereignty and our territorial integrity does not depend on anyone else,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday. The US is still deliberating what kind of military aide to send to Ukraine in the face of the Russian buildup. Ukraine will commission new military patrol boats, supplied by the US, in the coming days to bolster its missions in the Black Sea, according to two people familiar with the matter. The US is planning to send more anti-tank weapons like Javelin missiles, but has for now backed off of providing Ukraine with surface-to-air missiles, like Stingers, which Russia would view as provocative, sources said. The US and its allies in Europe and NATO have warned Russia of severe economic sanctions should it move to invade Ukraine. But Western officials are reluctant to get drawn into a direct military conflict with Russia, which Moscow understands, the senior Western intelligence official said. ""If you threaten force, and you keep your force in the field, and the interventions from the West, politically and militarily, are mild or nonexistent, that emboldens you,"" that official said. ""Generally speaking, I think the aim here is to make clear, 'I'm willing to take this big risk and use force and I'm betting that you are unwilling to engage with me and have a loss of life.' "" Western officials have been pushing for a diplomatic solution they hope will de-escalate tensions -- specifically, the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, a ceasefire protocol signed by Ukraine and Russia in 2015. ""It takes two to tango, and if ... our Russian friends are prepared to implement their commitments under Minsk and our Ukrainian friends are as well, we will fully support that, and that is the best way to avert a renewed crisis in Ukraine,"" Blinken said on Thursday. Critics have characterized the Minsk agreements as disproportionately advantageous to Moscow. But the US has been pushing Kiev and Moscow to implement their terms, including constitutional changes by Ukraine that would give autonomy to the separatist-run eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk. The city has been a major battleground between Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces for more than seven years, and some Biden administration officials believe that if Ukraine were to act first on Minsk, then the onus would be on Russia to de-escalate. But Ukrainian officials have pushed back on such a request, arguing that the Minsk agreements do not require such constitutional changes, people familiar with the discussions said. Russia also has yet to implement several of the Minsk provisions, including a ceasefire, withdrawal of all heavy weapons from the line of contact in eastern Ukraine and an all-for-all political prisoner exchange, as Blinken outlined on Thursday. ""And just as we've been clear with Moscow, we're also urging Ukraine to continue to exercise restraint,"" Blinken said. ""Because again, the Russian playbook is to claim provocation for something that they were planning to do all along.""",4,1.0439145783296224,2.2668520867480177,-1.2229375084183953,20
2021-12-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/02/politics/antony-blinken-sergey-lavrov-us-russia-meeting-intl/index.html,Blinken and Lavrov meet amid tensions over Russia's intentions in Ukraine,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met Thursday in Stockholm, Sweden, amid growing concern among Western powers that Russia is seeking to invade Ukraine. Blinken said he and Lavrov would report the details of their meeting back to President Joe Biden and President Vladimir Putin and that the two presidents ""may have the opportunity to speak directly in the near future."" Until then, he said it's Russia's responsibility to defuse the growing tension about its military movements and disinformation targeting Ukraine. ""It's now on Russia to deescalate the current tensions by reversing the recent troop buildup, returning forces to normal peacetime positions, and refraining from further intimidation and attempts to destabilize Ukraine,"" Blinken said at a press conference at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe summit. US officials tell CNN that plans for a conversation between Biden and Putin haven't been finalized, but that work has been underway to set up a call as Russian troops amass at the Ukraine border. Biden told reporters last week he would ""in all probability"" speak to Putin soon about the situation in Ukraine. He has said direct communication with Putin is the best way to avoid conflict between the two countries. 'Deep concerns' The last publicly announced phone call between Biden and Putin came in July, about a month after their in-person summit in Geneva. Blinken and Lavrov met on the sidelines of the OSCE summit. Their 30-minute conversation did not yield a concrete path forward, but both sides agreed to continue diplomatic conversations, a senior US State Department official told reporters traveling with the top US diplomat. Blinken also held a bilateral meeting earlier Thursday with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, at which the top US diplomat reiterated Washington's ""unwavering commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and its independence."" In remarks to the press after meeting with Lavrov, Blinken said he had ""made very clear our deep concerns and our resolve to hold Russia responsible for his actions, including to work with European allies to impose severe costs and consequences on Russia, if it takes further aggressive action against Ukraine."" The meeting comes a day after Blinken issued the most forceful US warning yet to Russia about any attempt to destabilize or invade Ukraine. Blinken had warned that there will be ""severe consequences"" for any Russian military action in Ukraine and that the US would ""respond resolutely, including with a range of high impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past."" Blinken did not lay out the ""serious consequences"" he has threatened if Russia invades Ukraine, according to the senior US State Department official. The official, who described Blinken's meeting with Lavrov as sober and professional, said the meeting resulted in an agreement to continue diplomatic conversations and that the US was able to make clear their concerns about the Russian military buildup. According to the State Department, Blinken ""addressed Russia's aggression towards Ukraine, including its military movements near Ukraine's borders"" and ""reiterated the United States' call for Russia to pull back its forces and return to a peacetime posture"" and to adhere to the 2015 Minsk agreements -- an effort to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine -- and a ceasefire in the Donbas region. The Minsk Protocol was written by Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE with France and Germany mediating. On Thursday, Blinken said he told Lavrov that the US was ready to get involved and had already offered to do so with Ukraine's top diplomat. ""And as with Foreign Minister Kuleba, I also made clear The United States is prepared to work with both parties to support a diplomatic resolution through implementation of Minsk agreements in any way that we can,"" he said. Combat troops Pentagon spokesman Ned Price said in his readout that Blinken ""underscored that the best path forward is diplomacy in conjunction with the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, a process the United States is willing and ready to support."" The US and NATO say Russia is increasing the number of combat troops near its border with Ukraine, while the Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans to invade Ukraine and sees NATO support for the country as a threat on Russia's western border. In his own remarks to the press after meeting with Blinken, Lavrov stressed that although Russia does ""not want any conflicts"" with NATO over Ukraine, it maintains the ""right to choose ways to ensure its legitimate security interests."" ""And let's not forget, of course, the proclaimed principle of indivisibility and security, including in the OSCE, in the NATO Council of Russia, which says that no one has the right to strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others,"" he said, also adding that ""the further advance of NATO to the East will definitely affect the fundamental interests"" of Russia's security. The United States, meanwhile, warned again that there would be ""serious consequences"" if Russia engages to ""pursue confrontation"" with Ukraine. On Thursday, Blinken told summit attendees that the US holds ""deep concerns about Russia's plans for renewed aggression against Ukraine."" This aggression would ""move us in exactly the opposite direction,"" Blinken said, stressing ""it's simply not in anyone's interest."" He added that ""the best way to avert the crisis is through diplomacy,"" calling on Russia to abide by the Minsk peace agreements. The interpretation of Minsk and other core OSCE documents emerged as a sticking point between the two countries, with Lavrov saying it ""is clear"" that the US and Russia interpret them in ""different ways."" Blinken criticized Russia's adherence to the Helsinki Final Act, a multilateral agreement dating back to 1975. That non-binding diplomatic accord recognized the inviolability of national borders created after World War II and the importance of noninterference in a nation's internal affairs, but Russia also saw it as implicitly recognizing its hegemony in Eastern Europe. Blinken said Russia ""continues to violate the Helsinki principles and repeatedly obstructs the work of this organization."" Despite the accusations, the two officials recognized the importance of dialogue, with Lavrov acknowledging ""the importance of our two states for global stability and for security, including in the Euro-Atlantic area."" During their private meeting, other subjects like Iran and the Nagorno-Karabakh region were also raised, but there was no discussion of the Russia-backed coup alleged by Ukraine's president. Price said Blinken raised the cases of two Americans detained in Russia -- Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed -- ""and underscored the priority we attach to their prompt release."" ""The Secretary and the Foreign Minister noted the importance of continued coordination on issues in the bilateral relationship and where interests are aligned, including when it comes to blocking Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon,"" he said. The OSCE summit comes on the heels of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Latvia that was dominated by concerns over recent events in Belarus and Russia's intentions in Ukraine. Speaking Wednesday after the meeting in Latvia, Blinken said the US and its NATO partners were prepared to impose costs for further Russian aggression against Ukraine and were preparing for ""all contingencies"" as Russia continues to make troubling moves. While Blinken hasn't detail what those penalties will be, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a Wednesday interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto that the alliance has ""a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions."" Putin called Wednesday for specific agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards and deployment of its weaponry close to Russia's borders. On Tuesday, the Russian President said NATO military expansion close to Russian borders and any deployment of missile systems in Ukraine would be crossing a ""red line.""",4,1.0477208380118486,1.5746153661257711,-0.5268945281139226,20

""We don't know whether President Putin has made the decision to invade"" Ukraine, Blinken said in remarks at the end of a North Atlantic Treaty Alliance meeting in Latvia. ""We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide. So despite uncertainty about intention, and timing, we must prepare for all contingencies while working to see to it that Russia reverses course."" Blinken spoke just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a speech that the ""threat"" at Russia's western border is growing. In his own remarks, Blinken noted that the world has already seen Moscow significantly increase troops along the border and deploy misinformation to suggest Ukraine is the aggressor. ""We've seen this playbook before in 2014 when Russia last invaded Ukraine, then as now they significantly increased combat forces near the border,"" Blinken said. ""Then as now, they intensified disinformation that Ukraine is the aggressor to justified pre-planned military action."" The top US diplomat again warned that such an action would be met with ""severe consequences."" ""We've made it clear to the Kremlin that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past,"" he said, adding that the NATO alliance is also ""prepared to impose severe costs for further Russian aggression in Ukraine"" and ""prepared to reinforce its defenses on the eastern flank."" Asked whether the US was considering going as far as cutting Russia off from the global financial system, Blinken declined to elaborate but said the US and allies would make sure Moscow knows. ""I'm not going to spell out today, the specifics, we will probably in time, share that with Moscow so that they can understand fully what's at risk, what the consequences would be if they commit further aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken said. ""And at the same time, we will work through all the details with our partners and allies."" 'A bad joke' NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto that the alliance has ""a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions."" Blinken's remarks, his most forceful on the issue to date, come as he is set to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday in Stockholm, according to a State Department official. Blinken will also meet with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on the margins of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Ministerial Council meeting, the official said. Blinken and Stoltenberg spoke just hours after Putin announced he would seek talks with NATO to get assurances the alliance will not expand eastwards into Ukraine or deploy weaponry close to Russian borders. The day before, Putin said NATO military expansion close to Russia's borders and any deployment of missile systems in Ukraine would be crossing a ""red line."" Asked about Putin's remarks, Blinken said they would be ""a bad joke if things weren't so serious."" Referring to NATO, Blinken said that ""as a defensive alliance, we're not a threat to Russia. We don't have aggressive intent toward Russia. Every step that we take is designed to make sure that we have in place protective, defensive measures to protect the members of the alliance as well as to help our partners have in place the defensive needs, so that they can properly defend themselves against aggression,"" Blinken said. ""That is the purpose of the Alliance."" ""The idea that Ukraine represents a threat to Russia, or for that matter that NATO represents a threat to Russia, it is profoundly wrong and misguided,"" Blinken added. Stoltenberg noted to CNN that after the first time Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO increased its defenses ""with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia ... but also in the Black Sea region."" Asked if he was saying that military options would be on the table if Russia invaded Ukraine, Stoltenberg clarified that Ukraine is not a NATO member, and therefore does not have the same security guarantees as NATO members, who have a commitment to come to each other's defense if one member is attacked. But Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that they cannot pursue NATO membership. ""Ukraine will become a member of NATO when the 30 allies agree that Ukraine meets the NATO standards,"" said Stoltenberg. ""But that's for the 30 allies to decide, not for Russia to decide."" Blinken emphasized the fluidity of the situation in his remarks after the NATO meeting. 'Prepare for all contingencies' Referring to Russia's efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor in order to justify military action, Blinken noted that ""we've seen that tactic again in just the past 24 hours. And in recent weeks, we've also observed a massive spike -- more than tenfold -- in social media activity pushing anti-Ukrainian propaganda approaching levels last seen in the lead up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014."" ""Despite uncertainty about intentions and timing, we must prepare for all contingencies while working to see to it that Russia reverses course,"" Blinken said. ""The United States has been engaging intensively with allies and partners on this issue, and directly with President Putin."" Blinken noted that CIA Director Bill Burns had traveled to Moscow at President Joe Biden's direction to convey to Russian leadership ""our concerns, our commitment to a diplomatic process and the severe consequences should Russia follow the path of confrontation and military action.""

Blinken's comments come amid concerns that Russia could mount another invasion in Ukraine as Moscow's military forces build up near the border. He made the remarks at a joint press conference with Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs in Riga, where he is attending a meeting of NATO foreign ministers aimed at addressing the massing of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine. ""It's increasingly belligerent rhetoric, it's recent buildup of forces. It's unusual troop movements along Ukraine's border,"" Blinken said, adding ""I'll have a lot more to say about that tomorrow after I've had a chance to consult with our allies in the NATO meetings that started this afternoon."" Blinken added, ""But for now, let me just reiterate that any escalatory actions by Russia would be of great concern to the United States as they would to Latvia and any renewed aggression can trigger serious consequences."" CNN previously reported that an official said the number of Russian units in the area has increased by about two-thirds in recent weeks. But US officials believe that the military activity in western Russia is irregular, multiple sources previously told CNN. The Biden administration is also weighing sending military advisers and new equipment including weaponry to Ukraine to prepare allies for a possible Russian invasion, multiple sources familiar with the deliberations told CNN last week. US officials have also been holding discussions with European allies about a new sanctions package that would go into effect if Russia invaded Ukraine, sources previously told CNN. And lawmakers are also jockeying over new sanctions language to include in the National Defense Authorization Act. Rinkēvičs also said Tuesday that the build-up of Russian troops on the Ukraine border and military movement was ""highly concerning,"" adding that he was ""extremely grateful"" to the US for its ""contribution to regional security and the national security of Latvia in developing them, both on a practical and political level.""",4,1.4721439174806437,1.4724500342808577,-0.0003061168002140846,20
2021-11-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/23/europe/ukraine-naval-base-russian-tensions-intl-cmd/index.html,"Fearing new Russian threat, Ukraine races to upgrade its navy","The Ukrainian naval patrol boat ""Kremenchuk"" churns out into the gun-grey waters of the Sea of Azov, one mounted machine gun pointing aft, another pointing fore into the drizzle. Commander Ivan Ovchar explains his ship's mission: ""To defend and maintain the sovereignty of Ukraine."" The threat, the officer and many of Ukraine's allies believe, comes from Russia. For weeks, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been expressing growing concern about Moscow's military activity on the Ukrainian border. ""We don't know what President [Vladimir] Putin's intentions are, but we do know what's happened in the past,"" Blinken said Saturday during a trip to Senegal, referring to Russian military incursions, acknowledged or not, into neighboring countries. ""We do know the playbook of trying to cite some illusory provocation from Ukraine or any other country and then using that as an excuse to do what Russia's planning to do all along."" The Kremlin has responded by accusing western countries of ""hysteria"" about Russia invading Ukraine. Strait jacket With tensions high in the region, CNN joined the Ukrainian navy vessel departing from Berdyansk on Ukraine's Azov coastline. Usually, Commander Ovchar's crew comes across six or seven Russian coast guard patrol boats, he says, but on this mission, there were none. The sea he's patrolling borders Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow following a controversial referendum in 2014, in violation of international law. Since seizing Crimea, Russia has built a bridge linking it to its own territory. The Kerch Bridge over the Kerch Strait serves as the only direct connection between Russia and Crimea -- and gives Moscow de facto control of the sea's access to the Black Sea and Mediterranean beyond. But Ukraine has a plan to try to keep Moscow from taking complete control of the body of water that links Ukraine's two biggest ports, Berdyansk and Mariupol. Ukraine's new Defense Minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, announced November 13 that the pace of building a new naval port in Berdyansk was to be increased. On Tuesday, CNN gained exclusive access to the ""Sehid"" or ""East"" base under construction. It was immediately clear that a lot of work still needed to be done for this base to be anywhere near completion. The aim was to complete the first phase of construction -- new living quarters, administrative buildings and a small medical facility on the site of a disused tin factory -- by the end of year. However, with less than six weeks to go, there was not even a roof on the main building. A special detachment of military builders toiled with masonry, slapping on cement and laying bricks, a Ukrainian flag billowing as they worked. The scale of the task at hand became even starker as we walked down onto the port, joined to a commercial port. ""This will be the position of the docks,"" Capt. 2nd Class Alexander Serdiyk said, pointing to heaps of warped metal and boulders lying haphazardly in the sea. ""We plan to have this section completed in two years."" But Ukraine may not have two years to prepare for conflict. The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, Brigader General Kyrylo Budanov, told the US defense newspaper Military Times that Russia was increasing troop levels and weapons systems in Crimea for an offensive that could come at any time. The Kremlin has repeatedly said it has no plans to invade Ukraine. ""The American and Ukrainian media claim that Russia is preparing for an attack on Ukraine, and we are saying that Ukraine is planning hostilities against Donbas, against the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk,"" Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Putin, said Tuesday. ""We are deeply concerned about the provocative actions of the Ukrainian armed forces on the line of contact and preparations for an attempt to forcefully resolve the Donbas issue."" Ukraine's allies have begun responding to what they see as a fresh threat from its neighbor to the east. On Monday, CNN reported that the Biden administration was weighing the possibility of sending military advisers and new equipment, including weaponry, to Ukraine. The package could include Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-armor missiles and mortars. The US is also considering sanctions with European allies if Russia invades Ukraine. Last week, British Defence Minister Ben Wallace visited Ukraine and signed an agreement to ""develop the capabilities of the naval forces of Ukraine."" CNN learned Tuesday that part of the deal will focus on Berdyansk. The same day, the Ukrainian navy announced the arrival of two ""Island-type"" boats named ""Fastiv"" and ""Sumy,"" delivered from Baltimore in the United States to Odessa in Ukraine. ""Soon the boats will raise the Ukrainian navy flag and under the command of Ukrainian crews they will begin their combat journey to ensure maritime safety in the Black and Azov seas,"" Admiral Alexey Neizhpapa said. The bigger question is whether new Ukrainian ships and infrastructure, plus warnings from the West, will be enough of a deterrent.",4,3.5273958568280235,2.876608870346731,0.6507869864812923,15
2021-11-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/22/politics/us-considering-weaponry-ukraine/index.html,US considering sending extra weaponry to Ukraine as fears mount over potential Russian invasion,"The Biden administration is weighing sending military advisers and new equipment including weaponry to Ukraine as Russia builds up forces near the border and US officials prepare allies for the possibility of another Russian invasion, multiple sources familiar with the deliberations tell CNN. The discussions about the proposed lethal aid package are happening as Ukraine has begun to warn publicly that an invasion could happen as soon as January. The package could include new Javelin anti-tank and anti-armor missiles as well as mortars, the sources said. Air defense systems, such as stinger missiles, are also under consideration, and the Defense Department has been pressing for some equipment that would have gone to Afghanistan -- like Mi-17 helicopters -- to instead be sent to Ukraine. The Mi-17 is a Russian helicopter that the US originally purchased to give to the Afghans. The Pentagon is now weighing what to do with them after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August. But others in the administration are concerned that sending stingers and helicopters could be seen by Russia as a major escalation. And while they are prepared to send some military advisers into the region, it is unclear whether any would go into Ukraine itself, the people said. Retired Lt. Col. Cedric Leighton told CNN that Javelin antitank missiles ""are quite effective against the T-80 tanks which the Russians are actually employing in these efforts against Ukraine right now."" But he noted that any additional assistance to Ukraine undoubtedly risks ""further heightening tensions"" with Moscow. Asked on Tuesday about the possibility that the US will send additional assistance to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""we shouldn't rule out the possibility of sending military advisers and weapons to Ukraine, because this is already taking place. Military advisers are arriving there, weapons are supplied there -- not only from the United States, but also from other NATO countries. And all this, of course, leads to a further aggravation of the situation on the border line."" Peskov accused Ukraine of provocations in the Russia-backed Ukrainian region of Donbass, but said that Russia ""is not going to attack anyone, Russia is not hatching any aggressive plans."" Sanctions discussions Meanwhile, US officials have been holding discussions with European allies about putting together a new sanctions package that would go into effect if Russia invaded Ukraine, the sources said. And lawmakers are also jockeying over new sanctions language to include in the National Defense Authorization Act. Asked about the Russian military activity, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday that the administration is concerned and has ""had extensive interactions with our European allies and partners in recent weeks, including with Ukraine."" She added that the US has ""also had held discussions with Russian officials about Ukraine and US-Russian relations in general."" The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, also spoke by phone with the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Lt. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny on Monday. The discussions reflect how seriously the Biden administration and Congress is taking the possibility that Russia could move to invade Ukraine, a strategic US ally, for the second time in under a decade. And US officials are determined not to be caught by surprise by a Russian military operation, as the Obama administration was in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea and powered an insurgency in parts of eastern Ukraine. ""Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week. Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, pushed back on the US' warnings about a potential invasion, calling them ""absolutely false"" in a statement on Monday. ""The US State Department through diplomatic channels brings to its allies and partners absolutely false information about the concentration of forces on the territory of our country for a military invasion of Ukraine,"" said Sergei Ivanov, head of the SVR's press bureau. For weeks, the US has been sharing intelligence with NATO partners and European allies on unusual Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border that US military and intelligence officials believe could be a precursor to a military operation on the country's eastern flank. The briefings have gone much further than in the past in terms of the level of alarm and specificity, US, European, and Ukrainian sources familiar with the discussions said. Ukraine's tone has also changed significantly since being briefed by the US. At the beginning of the month, Ukrainian officials downplayed reports that Russia was massing forces near the border. Now, following extensive meetings between US and Ukrainian officials, Ukraine's defense intelligence chief Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov is publicly warning that Russia is building a capacity to attack as soon as January -- a timeline in line with the US' assessments. 'No smoking gun' Still, officials say Russia's ultimate plan remains unclear. ""There is no smoking gun or decisive indicator of Putin's intentions,"" said one defense official. And it is possible that the maneuvers are an effort to sow confusion or to coerce the west into making concessions, rather than a precursor to an invasion. But the US is still warning of the possibility of the worst-case scenario that Moscow attempts regime change in Kiev, spurred largely by Putin's determination to keep Ukraine from growing closer to the West and potentially joining NATO. ""You don't achieve that goal by carving out another chunk of the eastern Donetsk region,"" said one person familiar with the intelligence. ""It's got to be something more than that. If that's [Putin's] goal, then you don't do that by doing something small."" US officials have also shared with senior Ukrainian officials evidence that Russia, through the FSB -- Russia's successor to the KGB -- is engaging in destabilizing activities inside Ukraine to foment dissent against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration. They have also pointed to the presence of Spetsnaz special forces and GRU and SVR intelligence operatives near Ukraine's borders. Ukrainian defense officials have projected that Russia could use the dozens of battalion tactical groups currently stationed near Ukraine's borders to launch an attack from multiple sides, including from annexed Crimea, according to Ukrainian military assessments provided to The Military Times. US officials are closely watching the Russian activity in Crimea, where Russia sent troops and military units in the spring as part of what it claimed were exercises. Although Russia's defense ministry ordered at least some of the troops to withdraw in April, some elements remained, according to the Ukrainian assessments and sources familiar with the matter. Moves in Congress Democratic and Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have added proposed amendments to the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act that would address Russia's latest provocations, but they have yet to sign off on a final version. An amendment proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez, reviewed by CNN, says that ""substantial new sanctions should be imposed"" by President Joe Biden against senior Kremlin officials -- including Russian President Vladimir Putin -- in the event of a Russian military escalation against Ukraine. The amendment also calls for additional sanctions on the Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, which Ukraine has been pushing for. The committee's Republicans see the Nord Stream sanctions language as a positive step, sources said, but want the amendment to trigger sanctions automatically in the event of a Russian incursion rather than leave the determination in the hands of the administration. Germany, which has been engaged in the pipeline project with Russia, recently announced that it is temporarily pausing the pipeline's certification process. But Ukraine also wants to see the US do more to stymie the pipeline, which it says Russia is weaponizing to weaken Ukraine by cutting it off from energy supplies and revenue heading into winter, an adviser to Zelensky told CNN. ""While the Biden administration is warning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, its most senior officials are on Capitol Hill trying to protect Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline by lobbying against the inclusion of sanctions against it in the annual defense bill,"" the adviser said.",4,1.756285792143931,3.2544445077971744,-1.4981587156532434,20
2021-11-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/15/politics/us-intelligence-russia-ukraine/index.html,US struggles with intelligence blind spot as Russia builds up forces near Ukraine,"After publicly sounding the alarm about Russia's irregular military movements near Ukraine's border, the Biden administration's efforts to understand Russia's intentions are being hampered by a key blind spot -- the intelligence community's limited visibility into Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle. ""The intelligence community's job in Russia has gotten progressively difficult,"" said one congressional source regularly briefed on the intelligence. ""It's moving toward what you would call a denied area."" US officials have said publicly in recent days that they don't yet know what Russia's intentions are -- privately, they say that is largely because of a lack of intelligence on discussions between Putin, who will decide whether to attempt to invade Ukraine, and his inner circle ""We don't have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a joint press conference at the State Department on Wednesday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Blinken added that Russia's recent movements were reminiscent of its invasion of Crimea in 2014. The Defense Department is also trying to understand Russia's end goal, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said last week. ""What we continue to see is unusual military activity inside Russia but near Ukraine's borders, and we remain concerned about that, and it's not exactly clear what the Russian intentions are, we obviously would like to better understand that,"" Kirby said. Sources familiar with the intelligence say it is not yet clear whether Russia intends to launch an invasion into Ukraine. But they note the trend lines are unsettling. Officials say the presence of Spetsnaz special forces and GRU and SVR intelligence operatives on the ground has increased concerns about the seriousness of Russia's actions and expands their capabilities to a full range of hybrid warfare tactics. The Office of the Director for National Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment. US officials briefed senior Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on these concerns when they were in Washington on Wednesday, one person familiar with the briefings said. Part of the information sharing was around how Russia might be employing such hybrid tactics first, trying to co-opt oligarchs and security forces in Ukraine ahead of time to essentially prime them for a large Russian entry. ""What we heard and saw today in Washington, DC, corresponds to our own findings and analysis, adds some new elements, which allow us to get a better and more comprehensive picture,"" Kuleba said. Ukraine's new defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, is expected to travel to Washington this week for an ""introductory"" meeting with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Kirby confirmed to CNN. The two will discuss the regional security situation, he said. A close-knit circle The US has struggled to penetrate the highest levels of the Kremlin since 2017, when one of the highest-level covert US sources inside the Russian government was extracted over safety concerns. Putin is known to keep a close-knit circle of advisers, so the number of potential sources with access to key information is vanishingly small. And the proliferation of digital surveillance tools in Moscow makes traditional human spying extremely difficult. ""You have two countervailing trends here,"" said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. ""One is the sheer difficulty of recruiting in any event, and then the openness and transparency that's available today, and everybody leaves electronic footprints."" Human intelligence, he added, has ""become difficult -- not to say that we don't do it."" But in Putin's case, reaching a close human source may not be possible, Clapper and others said. ""The decision-maker in Russia is one guy: It's Putin,"" Clapper said. ""It's my impression he really keeps his own counsel."" This has left the US intelligence community to rely on clues gleaned largely from satellites, as well as intercepted signals intelligence, to piece together Russia's plans. While officials can see Russian troops and weapons on the move it is still unclear how far Putin is willing to go. Without reliable insight into Putin's motives and decision-making process, ""the best we can do is signal as much as we can to try and deter an invasion,"" said another source familiar with the intelligence. The risk of a miscalculation, however, is higher when reliable intelligence is scarce. General Nick Carter, Britain's most senior military officer, said on Saturday that the risk of accidental war with Russia is greater now than during the Cold War. ""Many of the traditional diplomatic tools and mechanisms that you and I grew up with in the Cold War; these are no longer there,"" Carter said in an interview with Times Radio. ""And without those tools and mechanisms there is a greater risk that these escalations or this escalation could lead to miscalculation."" Putin, for his part, has suggested that any Russian use of force would be in reaction to a western encroachment in the region and attempts to recruit Ukraine into NATO. ""Formal membership (of Ukraine) in NATO may not take place, but military development of the territory is already under way,"" Putin told the Valdai Discussion Club last month. ""And this really poses a threat to Russia. We are aware of that."" Blinken warned on Wednesday that part of Russia's ""playbook"" is to claim ""falsely that it was provoked"" in order to justify a military response. ""Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" he said. ""So the playbook that we've seen in the past was to claim some provocation as a rationale for doing what it, what it intended and planned to do. All which is why we're looking at this very carefully.""",4,2.5191934668296083,1.9727314227696546,0.5464620440599537,20

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday warned Moscow against ""potential aggressive actions"" amid a large concentration of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders, deepening concerns over the potential for a wider geopolitical crisis. ""We have to be clear-eyed, we need to be realistic about the challenges we face. And what we see is a significant, large Russian military build-up,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Brussels. Though he said did not want to speculate about Russia's intentions, he added: ""We see an unusual concentration of troops, and we know that Russia has been willing to use these types of military capabilities before to conduct aggressive actions against Ukraine."" Ukraine is not a member of NATO or the EU. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that Russia's recent movements were reminiscent of its invasion of Crimea in 2014. The words of caution from NATO come days after Russia and Belarus flexed their military might near Poland in joint paratrooper drills. Russia, Belarus' largest political and economic partner, continues to defend Minsk's handling of the border crisis while also denying any involvement in it. On Monday, the EU ramped up pressure on all parties involved in the border crisis. The bloc's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell announced in a news conference in Brussels that EU foreign ministers have agreed to impose new sanctions on ""people, airlines, travel agencies and everyone involved in this illegal push of migrants against our borders."" The full list of people and entities would be ""confirmed in the coming days,"" he added. This will be the fifth round of sanctions slapped on Belarus by the EU following a disputed Presidential election and crackdown on dissidents. Borrell said earlier on Monday that he had spoken to the Belarusian foreign minister over the weekend, telling him ""the situation on the border was completely unacceptable and that humanitarian help was needed."" Thousands of people are stuck in freezing conditions near the Kuźnica-Bruzgi checkpoint, trying to cross into Poland. Polish border guards used loudspeakers on Monday to warn people there that force may be used against them if they don't follow orders. The authorities also deployed a helicopter and a water cannon into the area, although the water cannon has not been used. A column of police vehicles has been seen approaching the border. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia are considering triggering NATO's Article 4 over the crisis. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the Polish Press Agency on Sunday that his government is in talks with Latvia and Lithuania on whether to trigger the article, which calls for consultation when ""the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened."" Katarzyna Zdanowicz, a spokesperson for the Polish Border Guard, told CNN on Monday morning that around 4,000 people were camped out along the border and that the situation was ""very tense and very dangerous."" Zdanowicz said there had been ""forced mass attempts to cross the border"" in the Kuznica area by a group of 60 people on Sunday night. Those who tried to cross behaved ""aggressively,"" according to the border guard service. They threw stones and branches at Polish border police, she said, adding that weapons were being ""pointed towards our servicemen"" and a ""flare gun"" was fired towards them. More people were heading to the area on Monday. A CNN team witnessed thousands of people in the Bruzgi migrant camp in Belarus pick up their bags and start moving towards the Polish border on Monday morning. A rumor started circulating in the camp that the Polish government might open the border and allow a humanitarian corridor through to Germany. Poland has adamantly denied this and people amassed in the area have received text messages from Polish authorities saying the information was a ""total lie and nonsense."" The SMS message, also received by members of the CNN team in the area, reads in part: ""Poland won't let migrants pass to Germany. It will protect its border. Don't get fooled, don't try to take any action."" Belarus' State Border Committee said the people moving towards the border have ""purely peaceful intentions,"" according to Belarus state media BelTA. ""The refugees gathered warm clothes, tents, sleeping bags, hoping for a positive outcome of the situation. By noon, they self-organized into a large column and began to move towards the Bruzgi checkpoint,"" Anton Bychkovsky, the official representative of the border committee, was quoted as saying.",4,3.489883026787996,4.94399917011826,-1.4541161433302636,16
2021-11-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/10/politics/blinken-ukrainian-presser/index.html,Blinken says US is concerned Russia may be 'attempting to rehash' 2014 invasion of Ukraine,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States is ""concerned by reports of unusual Russian military activity"" and the possibility that Russia may be ""attempting to rehash"" its 2014 invasion of Ukraine. Blinken's comments came a week after Russia's powerful security chief did not deny that Moscow was moving troops or assuage the US' concerns about Russia's intentions during a meeting with CIA director Bill Burns, according to four people briefed on the discussion. Speaking alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba at the State Department, Blinken said that the US is ""concerned by reports of unusual Russian military activity,"" and is ""monitoring very closely"" the Russia activity. ""Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" Blinken said, referring to Russia's invasion of Crimea. ""So the playbook that we've seen in the past was to claim some provocation as a rationale for doing what it, what it intended and planned to do. All which is why we're looking at this very carefully."" The top US diplomat also reiterated the US' commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and independence, calling it ""ironclad."" In a post on his Facebook page Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the US for its support and for intelligence it had shared about the situation. ""Our Western partners have provided data on the active movement of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border and the increase in their concentration,"" he wrote. ""Foremost, we are very grateful to our partners for this information. This is a proof of support of Ukraine."" He echoed Blinken's remarks about Russia's playbook, saying that ""from [the] Russian side, we hear accusations that it is Ukraine that is delaying the peace process. ... I hope now the whole world can clearly see who really wants peace and who is concentrating almost 100,000 troops on our border."" 'Demotivate them' Kuleba also said the US and Ukraine shared ""elements"" with each other Wednesday regarding the Russian military activities. ""What we heard and saw today in Washington, DC, corresponds to our own findings and analysis, adds some new elements, which allow us to get a better and more comprehensive picture,"" he said. Blinken and Kuleba addressed reporters at the conclusion of a strategic dialogue that led to the signing of a renewed Ukraine-US Strategic Partnership. The Ukrainian official expressed gratitude to the US for deepening defense and security cooperation ""to help Ukraine build its capacity to defend itself and also to deter Russia to demotivate them from taking further aggressive actions."" ""The best way to deter aggressive Russias is to make it clear for the Kremlin that Ukraine is strong,"" Kuleba said. ""I have repeated on numerous occasions that Russian aggression against Ukraine will end on the day Ukraine's place as part of the West is institutionalized and undoubted. Today, we have made another important step in that direction."" Blinken said the US would continue to ""consult closely as well with allies and partners"" about Russia's troop movements. On Friday, the US sent out a formal diplomatic note, known as a démarche, to NATO allies providing them with additional intelligence and requesting further coordination in response to the irregular troop movements, a person familiar with the message said. ""As we make clear, any escalatory or aggressive actions will be of great concern to the United States,"" Blinken said Wednesday. He added that the US will continue to support deescalation in the region and a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Vigilant and resilient Kuleba indicated that finding a diplomatic way out could be difficult. Pointing to various Russian efforts to destabilize Europe -- including its coercive use of energy supplies, ""propaganda efforts, disinformation, cyberattacks, military buildups, an attempt of Russia to digest Belarus"" -- the Ukrainian diplomat warned that ""in this complicated game, we have to remain vigilant, we have, have to be resilient."" The joint press appearance is just the latest effort by the Biden administration to demonstrate support for Ukraine, some of which has happened behind closed doors. Burns met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia's security chief, Nikolai Patrushev, last week, as the Biden administration has grown increasingly concerned about Russia's recent troop movements near Ukraine. As CNN first reported Friday, President Joe Biden dispatched Burns to Moscow to deliver a clear message to the Kremlin that the US is monitoring the movements closely. In response, Patrushev did not deny that Russia was accumulating military units in the area, according to the four people briefed on the discussion. That stood in contrast to the Kremlin's recent assertion that satellite images showing such a buildup -- including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles at a training ground roughly 186 miles from the border -- were ""low-quality"" and ""fake."" 'The big question is...' The exact number of new Russian forces currently staged there is not clear. One official told CNN that the number of units in the area has increased by about two-thirds in recent weeks. But US officials believe that the military activity in western Russia is irregular, multiple sources told CNN. For one thing, it is the off-season for military exercises in Russia. Some of the units on the ground are also a long way from their headquarters, said Michael Kofman, an expert on Russian military studies at the Center for Naval Analyses. ""The big question is why are units from the Central Military District 3,000 miles from their garrison hanging around for the winter?"" he said. ""It is difficult to find an innocuous explanation for the military activity that's been taking place."" Russian special forces, known as the Spetsnaz, are also on the ground there, two people familiar with the intelligence said. Special forces greatly expand hybrid warfare capabilities, such as psychological operations. Still, US officials and outside experts closely tracking the movements say they don't see signs that Russia is preparing to invade in the coming days or weeks. They don't yet see what is known as a ""logistics tail,"" for example -- the supply lines that would be needed for any military to launch a combat operation. Those sources say Russia does appear to be positioning itself to be able to launch a military campaign in the coming months, perhaps as soon as January. Missing ingredients, like a logistics tail, could be amassed on short notice, Kofman noted. Following his meetings in Russia, Burns spoke to Zelensky by phone in an attempt to diffuse tensions, the sources told CNN. A senior State Department official was also dispatched to Kiev on Thursday to support those efforts. The flurry of high-level diplomacy underscores how seriously the Biden administration is taking the latest Russian troop movements, even after an earlier buildup this spring ultimately did not lead to a renewed invasion.

2021-11-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/politics/revil-ransomware-attack-charges/index.html,US seizes $6 million in ransom payments and charges Ukrainian over major cyberattack,"Law enforcement officials seized an estimated $6 million in ransom payments and federal prosecutors charged a suspect from Ukraine over a damaging July ransomware attack on an American company in a breakthrough for the Biden administration's pursuit of cybercriminals, the Justice Department announced Monday. Yaroslav Vasinskyi, a Ukrainian national who was arrested in Poland last month, is accused of deploying ransomware known as REvil, which has been used in hacks that have cost US firms millions of dollars. Vasinskyi conducted a ransomware attack over the Fourth of July weekend on Florida-based software firm Kaseya that infected up to 1,500 businesses around the world, according to an indictment unsealed Monday. Vasinskyi and another alleged REvil operative, Russian national Yevgeniy Polyanin, are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, among other charges. As part of the investigation, authorities seized at least $6 million in funds allegedly linked to ransom payments received by Polyanin, US officials said. CNN was first to report on the law enforcement actions before the Justice Department announcement. The law enforcement bust is one of the most impactful actions yet in the Biden administration's multipronged fight against ransomware, which accelerated after a series of hacks hampered US critical infrastructure firms this year. While some ransomware groups have continued to breach US companies and demand payment, others have gone quiet in recent months. Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference that the US and its allies would do ""everything in our power"" to track down ransomware operatives and claw back the money ""they have stolen from the American people."" Vasinskyi, 22, is being held in Poland pending US extradition proceedings, while Polyanin, 28, remains at large. CyberScoop, first reported that Vasinskyi had been arrested. The Treasury Department on Monday also imposed sanctions on Vasinskyi and Polyanin, as well as cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly has moved money for ransomware operatives. The State Department meanwhile announced a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of the leadership of the REvil ransomware gang. The department is also offering up to $5 million for information leading to an arrest or conviction of anyone conspiring or attempting to participate in REvil ransomware attacks. US officials have pursued diplomacy with the Russian government, sanctioned a cryptocurrency exchange and exhorted companies to raise their cyber defenses. But experts say that putting ransomware operators in handcuffs is a crucial part of the US strategy to curb attacks. Romanian authorities last week arrested two additional alleged REvil operatives, Europol announced Monday. And South Korean authorities last month extradited to the US a Russian man accused of being part of a different crime ring that infected millions of computers worldwide. In a statement later on Monday, President Joe Biden said, ""We are bringing the full strength of the federal government to disrupt malicious cyber activity and actors, bolster resilience at home, address the abuse of virtual currency to launder ransom payments, and leverage international cooperation to disrupt the ransomware ecosystem and address safe harbors for ransomware criminals."" Biden administration has made tackling ransomware groups a priority Biden in June asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to take action against criminal hackers that were holding US companies hostage. But the Russian government has historically been reluctant to pursue cybercriminals on its own soil as long as the hackers refrain from hitting Russian targets. Since the Biden-Putin summit, ""We have not seen a material change in the landscape,"" US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told the Associated Press last week. ""Only time will tell as to what Russia may do on this front."" Garland on Monday declined to comment when asked if the Russian government was aware of or condoned the REvil activity, citing an ongoing investigation. In a crowded landscape of cyber crooks, REvil has stood out for a series of brazen attacks. The group reportedly demanded $50 million from Apple earlier this year after hacking one of the tech giant's suppliers. The FBI has also blamed REvil for a May ransomware attack on JBS USA, which accounts for about a fifth of US beef production. The incident forced JBS to temporarily shut down production at facilities in Australia, Canada and the US. JBS paid the hackers $11 million to unlock their systems. REvil has been deployed on about 175,000 computers worldwide, with at least $200 million paid in ransom, Garland said Monday. Polyanin allegedly conducted about 3,000 ransomware attacks, including some on law enforcement agencies and municipalities throughout Texas, Garland said. REvil has had a volatile few months. The websites the group uses to extract ransoms and shame victims went offline after the Kaseya hack, only to reemerge in September. But the group shut down again last month after a foreign government and Cyber Command, the US military's hacking unit, compromised the group's computer infrastructure, according to a Washington Post report. To turn up the pressure, the State Department last week announced a $10 million reward for key information on the hackers behind the so-called DarkSide ransomware, which forced major US fuel provider Colonial Pipeline to shut down for days in May. Government agencies have leaned heavily on private experts in their pursuit of criminal hackers. Cybersecurity firm Emsisoft, for example, saved victims of a type of ransomware millions of dollars in ransom payments by discovering a flaw in the hackers' code. John Fokker, a former Dutch cybercrime investigator who is now with cybersecurity firm McAfee Enterprise, told CNN that his team had helped law enforcement identify multiple suspects involved in REvil and Gandcrab, another type of ransomware. No single law enforcement action will be a fatal blow to the lucrative, transnational ransomware economy. Victims of ransomware attacks paid about $350 million in ransoms in 2020, according to Chainalysis, a firm that tracks cryptocurrency. But that figure is likely just a fraction of the digital extortion that went on that year. And victims who don't pay the ransom can spend millions of dollars rebuilding their computer infrastructure. FBI Director Christopher Wray told US lawmakers in September that the bureau was investigating more than 100 different types of ransomware.",20,7.031379801424395,4.930284960518361,2.1010948409060335,2

Putin's spokesperson also confirmed there was a discussion. ""Yes, such a conversation took place via telephone,"" Putin's spokesperson Dimitry Peskov told CNN on Monday CNN reported Friday that Burns' visit to the Russian capital took place at a time of growing concern among some US officials about the possibility of an expanded Russian military intervention in Ukraine. One source told CNN that the US has ""serious concerns"" about the Russian build-up, adding, ""It would be foolish for us not to be considering the possibility of an invasion or incursion."" When asked about the topics touched upon during this phone conversation, Peskov said they were ""Bilateral relations, the crisis situation in the diplomatic practice, and an exchange of views on regional conflicts."" ""Of course, cybersecurity issues were also mentioned,"" Peskov added. Assessments on Russia's motives differ widely within the administration, with some sources telling CNN they believe Russia could be preparing for an invasion, while others suggest they are conducting an exercise, or simply trying to intimidate Ukraine. And publicly, Ukraine has downplayed the idea that Russia is building up its military presence near the border beyond normal levels. Russia has ""established a practice of ""transferring and accumulating military units for the purpose of maintaining tension in the region and political pressure on neighboring countries,"" Ukraine's Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies last week demonstrate the kind of irregular Russian troop and equipment movements that US officials are worried about.

2021-11-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/05/politics/bill-burns-moscow-ukraine/index.html,CIA director dispatched to Moscow to warn Russia over troop buildup near Ukraine,"President Joe Biden dispatched CIA Director Bill Burns to Moscow earlier this week to warn the Kremlin that the US is watching its buildup of troops near Ukraine's border closely, and to attempt to determine what is motivating Russia's actions. The rare trip by Burns to Russia, where he held talks with senior Kremlin security officials directly involved in the military activity, came as the US has grown increasingly concerned by Russia's irregular movement of troops and equipment near Ukraine's northern border, according to multiple US and Ukrainian sources briefed on the meeting. The Biden administration has ramped up its efforts in recent days to de-escalate growing tensions between Moscow and Kiev. Following his meetings in Russia, Burns spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone in an attempt to diffuse those tensions, the sources told CNN. A senior State Department official was also dispatched to Kiev on Thursday to support those efforts. The flurry of high-level diplomacy underscores how seriously the Biden administration is taking the latest Russian troop movements, even after an earlier buildup in the spring ultimately did not lead to a renewed invasion. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia have also been exacerbated in recent weeks by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kiev believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. ""The buildup, coupled with the energy blackmail, does suggest a more aggressive Russian posture,"" an adviser to Zelensky told CNN.

Burns also brought up US concerns that Russia is close to using its gas exports as leverage, with Ukraine and other European nations forecast to suffer energy crises heading into winter. After his meetings in Moscow, Burns called Zelensky on Wednesday to convey the administration's concerns over Russia's behavior and reassure him that the US is closely tracking the Russian activity, according to a person with direct knowledge of the call. Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Monday demonstrate the kind of irregular Russian troop and equipment movements that US officials are worried about. The images show Russian troops, tanks and artillery massing near the Russian town of Yelnya, and the Biden administration is more concerned than it was in the spring that Russia could launch an invasion, two senior US officials said. In response to questions about the satellite images, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters this week that ""The movement of our military equipment or army units across the territory of the Russian Federation is exclusively our business."" He added that ""Russia has never threatened anyone, is not threatening, and does not pose a danger to anyone. But against the background of rather aggressive expansionist tendencies, especially on the part of NATO and other countries, Russia has always taken measures to ensure its security and will continue to do so."" But one US official told CNN that the US has ""serious concerns"" about the Russian build up, adding, ""It would be foolish for us not to be considering the possibility of an invasion or incursion."" Another State Department official and a senior congressional aide noted that the US concerns stem largely from the fact that Russia appears to be putting pieces into place should it want to take action against Ukraine quickly. ""It is certainly an unprecedented buildup, and if Russia wanted to invade Ukraine, it has the capability and capacity to overwhelm Ukrainian forces,"" the aide said. ""With such a large buildup, Putin could order an invasion at any time and there would be very little warning."" Intense outreach to allies European diplomats in the US and Europe say that the US has been conducting intense outreach about Russia, an effort that began in just the last few days. ""The administration is very, very concerned—this is the most concerned I've heard them about Russia in a really, really long time,"" said one diplomat. ""I wouldn't underestimate this. They're doing a massive outreach to raise awareness about this."" The concerns the US is sharing are ""pretty specific"" said another diplomat, who echoed others in saying that they are now being carefully and closely examined in European capitals, where perceptions of the Russian threat vary. Even so, diplomats from five different European countries acknowledged that the trendline of Russian actions in relation to Ukraine have been worrying. Concerns over the Kremlin's intentions stem from Russia's invasion of the Crimean peninsula in 2014. The international community, led by the US, imposed sanctions on Russia for the subsequent illegal annexation of the Ukrainian territory, but the multilateral sanctions have done nothing to push Russia back from the peninsula. Putin has made clear his plans to keep Russian forces there, despite international opposition. ""They're definitely being taken very seriously,"" the second diplomat said. ""There is clearly a trend line over here -- you can go back all the way to 2014, of course,"" when Russia invaded Crimea. ""But since the spring of this year,"" a constellation of developments has drawn attention, including the Russian escalation around Ukraine, the only partial withdrawal of those troops, Russia's move to leave some military hardware behind on the border, and a sharpening of Russian rhetoric about Ukraine. Diplomats noted an article President Vladimir Putin wrote this summer, which one diplomat described as a ""revisionist manifesto"" about Ukrainian history meant to fit Russian arguments and deny the foundation for a Ukrainian state. More recently, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, wrote a similar article denigrating Ukraine and its leaders. Watching 'with all of our capabilities' The administration is far from reaching a consensus on Russia's intentions, however, and other defense officials told CNN they have not seen indications that Russia is preparing for a sustained operation like an invasion. That would require supplies to be brought into the area like food, fuel and spare parts, the officials said. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said this week the US wasn't seeing anything to indicate an imminent Russian move on Ukraine, but he still expressed concern at the ""significant amount"" of military movements along the border. Speaking to NBC's Lester Holt at the Aspen Security Forum, Milley said the Russian activity was ""nothing overtly aggressive per se,"" but he cautioned that the US is watching the movements ""with all of our capabilities."" Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, say they do not believe the US has done enough to deter Russian aggression. Kiev has been pushing the US to do more to stop the Russia-Germany gas pipeline known as Nord Stream 2 from becoming fully operational, which will allow Russia to bypass Ukraine entirely when delivering gas to Europe and, Kiev argues, make Ukraine even more vulnerable to Russian advances. But the Biden administration waived some sanctions on Nord Stream 2 earlier this year, organized a summit with Putin in June, and has been trying to find common ground with Moscow on issues like ransomware and nuclear stability. ""The best signal the administration could send to Russia right now, to show that there are repercussions for their behavior, would be to reverse course on Nord Stream 2,"" the Zelensky adviser said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the UN's climate summit earlier this week, where they discussed joint concerns about the unusual Russian military movement and the country's potentially coercive use of its energy supplies, a State Department official said. Those subjects will be revisited when Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba travels to Washington for talks with Blinken next week, the official said.",4,3.0133998878123447,3.4416622501914977,-0.42826236237915305,20
2021-11-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/04/europe/russia-ukraine-military-buildup-intl-cmd/index.html,Satellite photos raise concerns of Russian military build-up near Ukraine,"Once more, tensions are rising in Ukraine. Reports that the Russians are moving military hardware some 250 kilometers from the border have raised eyebrows in Washington. And Ukrainian forces have deployed combat drones along the battle lines that separate them from pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region. The front lines of the conflict -- a standoff stretching hundreds of miles from northern Ukraine to the Sea of Azov -- have barely moved in five years. On Monday, US Defense Department spokesman Admiral John Kirby said the Pentagon was ""aware of public reports of unusual Russian military activity near Ukraine."" Satellite imagery has shown Russian hardware -- including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles -- on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300km) from the border. But Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Monday it had recorded no ""additional transfer of Russian units, weapons and military equipment to the state border of Ukraine."" On Tuesday, the Defense Ministry said an estimated 90,000 Russian troops were located ""near the border and in the temporarily occupied territories"" as well as in the Black Sea. Ukraine's Defense Ministry added that Russia had established a practice of ""transferring and accumulating military units for the purpose of maintaining tension in the region and political pressure on neighboring countries."" Kirby said the US was watching closely: ""I can't speak for Russian intentions, but we are certainly monitoring the region closely, as we always do. Any escalatory or aggressive actions would be of great concern to the United Sates."" On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""The movement of our military equipment or army units across the territory of the Russian Federation is exclusively our business. ""Russia has never threatened anyone, is not threatening, and does not pose a danger to anyone,"" he insisted. Observers say Russia's actions are worth keeping a close eye on. ""At the moment it is a developing situation. It's not 'nothing happening' and it doesn't mean that there will be an offensive op tomorrow,"" says Michael Kofman, a fellow at the Wilson Center who researches Russia's military. 'Provocation' claims We've been here before -- several times -- since the separatists, with Russian backing, entered eastern Ukraine in 2014. Heightened tensions have, in the past, come to nought. Russian units gathered near the border last spring -- setting off alarm bells in western capitals -- but eventually returned to base. But hopes that the frozen conflict might be defused through negotiations sponsored by European governments and the US are moribund. Russia has responded swiftly to Ukraine's use of Turkish-made combat drones for the first time in the conflict. One of those drones struck a separatist position last week. ""We observe attempts to carry out provocations, elicit some reaction from the militia and drag Russia into some kind of combat action,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian state television Monday. Popular Russian TV host Vladimir Soloviev went further, saying Ukraine was provoking the separatist-held ""Republics"" into taking ""retaliatory measures, which means a major war. Under these circumstances, Moscow will be confronted with a serious choice."" Russian rhetoric towards Ukraine has hardened in recent months. Both President Vladimir Putin and his predecessor, Dmitri Medvedev, have penned essays describing Ukraine as a vassal of the West -- even going so far as to suggest it is not a real country. In a long article in July, Putin said ""the formation of an ethnically pure Ukrainian state, aggressive towards Russia, is comparable in its consequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against us."" ""True sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia,"" he wrote. Pivot from east to west Moscow's strategy is aimed at deterring Ukraine's flirtation with closer ties to NATO and the European Union, a pivot from east to west that would stoke historic Russian fears of encirclement. Those fears deepened when the former Soviet Baltic states joined NATO, along with several ex-members of the Warsaw Pact, such as Romania and Poland. Just last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reiterated US support for Ukraine's ""reorientation,"" pledging ""continued US support for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity and Euro-Atlantic aspirations."" Ukraine joining NATO would be an ""extremely dangerous"" move that would trigger retaliatory measures from Russia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko retorted. Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Peskov condemned what he said were ""aggressive expansionist tendencies, especially on the part of NATO and other countries,"" adding that ""Russia has always taken measures to ensure its security and will continue to do so."" The US, which already supplies Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, also promised to support Ukrainian forces through security assistance, including efforts to enhance the country's maritime capacity. US warships regularly patrol the Black Sea -- much to Russia's ire. Russia's latest weapon in the conflict is not camo-painted. Instead, it comes through a pipeline. The Nord Stream 2 (NS2) gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany is near completion, and that worries Ukraine -- which has been a transit route for Russian gas through its extensive network of pipelines. ""Putin is telling everyone to their face: 'You allow NS2 to become operational or you won't get any more gas,'"" according to Yuriy Vitrenko, chief executive of Ukraine's Naftogaz. Vitrenko told the Financial Times that ""[If] there will be no physical transit going through Ukraine, it increases the chances of a full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine."" The White House said at the weekend that US President Joe Biden had spoken with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about efforts ""to ensure that Russia cannot manipulate natural gas flows for harmful political purposes."" As yet, there are no signs that all the adversarial language is translating into a higher level of hostilities along what's known as ""the line of contact,"" but Russian calculations are never easy to gauge.",4,1.496859405216472,3.6557744500436087,-2.1589150448271366,20
2021-10-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/28/politics/russian-extradited-south-korea-ohio/index.html,Russian accused of being part of cybercrime ring extradited from South Korea to Ohio,"A Russian man accused of being part of cybercrime ring that infected millions of computers worldwide was arraigned in federal court in Ohio on Thursday after being extradited from South Korea, the Justice Department announced. US prosecutors allege that 38-year-old Vladimir Dunaev was part of a transnational criminal group that since 2015 has tried to steal millions of dollars from victims in the US and elsewhere. The group allegedly used a piece of malicious software known as Trickbot and other tools to steal money and confidential data from businesses in multiple countries including the US, United Kingdom, Russia and India. The hackers also targeted the computer networks of hospitals, schools, public utilities and governments, according to prosecutors. Dunaev is charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft, and multiple counts of wire and bank fraud, among other charges, the Justice Department said. He faces up to 60 years in prison if convicted on all counts. Dunaev entered a not guilty plea in his initial court appearance Thursday and waved detention, according to Daniel Ball, a spokesman for the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. An attorney for Dunaev could not be immediately reached for comment. The arrest is a notable win for the US Justice Department, which is typically forced to wait until accused Russian cybercriminals leave Russia to pursue them because Washington and Moscow do not have an extradition treaty. It comes as the Biden administration has tried to pressure the Russian government to crack down on cybercrime amid continued ransomware attacks against US companies. In a press release that did not mention Dunaev by name, the South Korean Ministry of Justice said it had extradited a Russian national accused of being involved in the Trickbot malware to the United States on October 20. The ministry said the Russian national was arrested in June at South Korea's Incheon International Airport. Another person allegedly involved with Trickbot, a Latvian national known as Alla Witte, was arrested in Miami in February and is also being prosecuted in the Northern District of Ohio. Prosecutors accused Witte of writing computer ""code related to the control, deployment, and payments of ransomware."" Witte pleaded not guilty in June, according to Ball, the Northern District of Ohio spokesman. Dunaev also allegedly used his technical skills in support of Trickbot. According to prosecutors, he helped the malware avoid being detected by security software. The extradition of Dunaev follows the FBI and European law enforcement agencies' arrest last month of two people in Ukraine who have allegedly made multimillion-dollar ransom demands following hacks of US organizations. The Justice Department's pursuit of foreign cybercriminals is meant as a complement to diplomatic pressure that US officials are putting on Moscow to address the issue. Despite a June meeting between Biden and Putin on the topic, ransomware attacks on US companies have continued. Earlier this month a ransomware incident interrupted programming at Sinclair Broadcast Group, the second largest operator of TV stations in the US. A hacking tool used to encrypt Sinclair's networks is similar to malicious code previously used by a Russian crime group sanctioned by the US government, analysts told CNN. Trickbot has had a key role in some ransomware attacks on US companies; hackers have used the malicious software to access victim networks and then deploy ransomware to lock up their computers. The FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in October 2020 warned that Trickbot was being used in a wave of ransomware attacks on US health care organizations. Concerned by the potential threat of ransomware to election infrastructure in 2020, Microsoft and other tech companies last year knocked some computer servers used by Trickbot offline. While some of the people allegedly involved in Trickbot have been apprehended, the malicious code itself is alive and well. Researchers with IBM reported this month some of the developers of Trickbot had begun working with two additional criminal groups to distribute malicious code to targeted organizations. The Biden administration has also sought to expand international coordination in prosecuting ransomware groups and curtailing their sources of revenue. The White House this month convened a 30-country virtual meeting to that end. Andres Sutt, a senior Estonian government official who attended the meeting, told CNN that governments need to invest a greater proportion of their IT budgets in cybersecurity to effectively defend against ransomware. ""If we look at the intensity of [ransomware] attacks, the sophistication, the impacts, I think it's only clear that we need to respond in being more cyber resilient,"" said Sutt, who is Estonia's minister of entrepreneurship and information technology.",20,4.595280771353082,1.8333154327926875,2.761965338560394,2

Austin's visit to Ukraine is his second stop in Europe this week ""to reassure allies and partners of America's commitment to their sovereignty in the face of Russian aggression,"" according to the Pentagon. The US defense secretary on Monday visited Georgia, where Russia still occupies roughly 20% of the nation, and plans to visit Romania, ahead of attending the NATO Defense Ministerial in Brussels. The White House last week called on Russia to take further action against ransomware groups operating from the country, but acknowledged that Moscow has taken ""some steps"" after President Joe Biden urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to tackle the groups in the summer. Biden in June urged Putin to crack down on Russian-speaking hackers after a recent string of ransomware attacks crippled critical infrastructure and business operations, like the attack against Colonial Pipeline in May. Russian hackers were also deemed to be behind last year's massive breach of several US federal agencies by exploiting software made by SolarWinds. Earlier this year, Russian troops had amassed the largest buildup of troops near the Ukrainian border since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Kiev. Russia, however, pulled back from a confrontation, returning troops to their bases after taking part in exercises near the Ukraine border. As the US steps up its support to the neighbors of Russia that are on the ""frontlines of Russian aggression,"" Russia announced Monday it is suspending its permanent mission to NATO. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the move was in response to the alliance's expulsion of eight Russians earlier this month. On Tuesday, Austin stressed that the US' support for Ukraine sovereignty is ""unwavering"" and ""we will continue to do everything we can to support Ukraine's efforts to develop the capability to defend itself."" Asked about Russia's opposition to Ukraine's accession to NATO, Austin argued that Ukraine ""has a right to decide its own future foreign policy and we expect that they will be able to do that without any outside interference.""

A senior administration official told reporters that the US wants to see ""follow-up actions"" ahead of a 30-country virtual meeting on ransomware that began Wednesday. The US government has ""shared information with Russia regarding criminal ransomware activity being conducted from its territory,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules that the White House set for the call. ""We've seen some steps by the Russian government and are looking to see follow-up actions,"" said the official, who declined to say what those steps and actions were. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan kicked off the virtual meeting by telling delegates, ""We cannot do this alone."" Sullivan called for more cooperation on ransomware to ""hold criminals and the states that harbor them accountable."" ""Transnational criminals are most often the perpetrators of ransomware crimes, and they often leverage global infrastructure and money laundering networks across multiple countries, multiple jurisdictions to carry out their attacks,"" Sullivan said. A spokesperson for the Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Biden in June urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to crack down on Russian-speaking hackers after a string of ransomware attacks cost US companies millions of dollars. One such incident forced Colonial Pipeline, which provides some 45% of fuel for the East Coast, to shut down operations for days in May. The disruptions have placed cybersecurity, and ransomware in particular, high on the list of national security priorities for the White House. Senior government officials from the US and 30 allied countries are meeting virtually Wednesday and Thursday to forge closer cooperation in the fight against ransomware, which has knocked computers offline at health care centers in multiple countries during the coronavirus pandemic. Australia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom are among the countries represented at the meetings, according to the White House. The discussions are focusing on efforts to prosecute and disrupt ransomware groups and on dealing with the role of cryptocurrency in funding ransomware attacks, among other issues. Russia is conspicuously absent from the meetings as the White House tries to make progress in bilateral talks with Moscow. Since the Biden-Putin meeting, US officials have watched closely for changes in behavior from the Russian government and for any change in the pace of cybercriminal operations emanating from Russia. Mandiant, a US cybersecurity firm that responds to ransomware incidents, has reported a lull in activity from some ransomware groups. But whether any reduction in ransomware attacks endures remains to be seen. A spokesperson for Recorded Future, another cybersecurity firm, told CNN that the firm has been tracking a ""Russian-based ransomware group that currently has over 100 members"" and is ""actively recruiting new cybercriminals."" Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said last week that she had not seen ""significant, material changes"" in Russian behavior since the tete-a-tete between Biden and Putin. Cybersecurity analysts say one of the most effective ways to combat ransomware is to arrest the people who develop and deploy the computer-locking software. While Russian cooperation has been elusive, the US has leaned heavily on allies in Europe in raids against some criminal groups. The FBI and European enforcement agencies last month arrested two people in Ukraine who allegedly had made multimillion-dollar ransom demands following hacks of European and US organizations. Timo Koster, a former Dutch diplomat focused on cybersecurity, said he expects countries like the US and the Netherlands to encourage other governments to take more assertive actions against cybercriminal groups. ""More international cooperation is needed"" in coordinating how countries attribute cyberattacks to specific actors and on responses from law enforcement and security agencies, Koster told CNN.",20,1.2243478932308673,1.3366742314876932,-0.11232633825682581,2
2021-10-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/07/politics/russian-hackers-microsoft-report/index.html,"Russian state-backed hackers having greater success at breaching foreign government targets, Microsoft says","Russian state-backed hackers are having greater success at breaching targets in the United States and elsewhere as they make government organizations the primary focus of their attacks, according to data that Microsoft released Thursday. Government organizations accounted for more than half of the targets for Moscow-linked hacking groups for the year through June 2021, compared to just 3% the previous year, according to Microsoft. At the same time, the success rate of Russian intrusions into government and non-government targets has gone from 21% to 32% year over year, the technology giant said in a report focusing on state-backed and cybercriminal activity. The report comes as the Biden administration has looked to bolster US government defenses against cyber espionage from Russia -- and publicly expose that activity with US allies. The European Union last month blasted alleged Russian hacking and leaking operations that the bloc said were aimed at interfering in democracy. But despite the US and its allies condemning Russian and Chinese behavior in cyberspace, those countries are ""still comfortable leaning into nation-state attacks,"" said Cristin Goodwin, associate general counsel and head of Microsoft's Digital Security Unit. ""And we're seeing that increase."" The data includes the Russian espionage operation that breached at least nine US federal agencies in 2020 by exploiting software made by SolarWinds, a Texas-based firm. CNN reported Wednesday that the same Russian group behind that activity has in recent months continued to try to breach US and European government organizations. The Biden administration in April blamed Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, for that spying campaign. Moscow has denied involvement in the hacking. North Korea, Iran and China were next most active countries Microsoft also reported Thursday that 58% of government-linked hacking attempts originated in Russia, followed by 23% from North Korea, 11% from Iran and 8% from China. The data comes with caveats. A flurry of unsuccessful attempts to guess target organizations' passwords, for example, count as separate hacking attempts. And Microsoft did not report on US intelligence agencies, which also conduct cyber-espionage campaigns. But with over one billion devices using Microsoft software worldwide, the technology provider has a broader view of malicious cyber activity than most other organizations. And the data tells its own story. Cyber activity, for example, often correlates with larger geopolitical dynamics and tensions. While Russia beefed up its troop presences along its border with Ukraine earlier this year, the same hacking group that carried out the SolarWinds breaches has ""heavily target[ed] Ukrainian government interests,"" according to Microsoft. The number of Microsoft customers in Ukraine ""impacted"" by the Russian hacking group soared to 1,200 in the fiscal year ending in June compared to just six the year prior. ""Historically, nation-state attacks tend to follow where a geopolitical priority sits for a country,"" Goodwin told CNN. Google on Thursday announced that APT28, a Russian hacking group that interfered in the 2016 election, had sent some 14,000 malicious emails to Gmail users around the world in late September. The phishing was aimed at government personnel, journalists and defense firms, among others, according to Google. US organizations were among those targeted. Shane Huntley, director of the Google Threat Analysis Group, said that all of the emails had been classified as spam and blocked by Gmail. Much of public attention on alleged Russian cyber operations in the last year has been on the group that bugged SolarWinds software. But there's an array of hacking teams at Moscow's disposal that carry out different missions against valuable targets in the US and allied countries, analysts say. Some of those groups specialize in infiltrating critical infrastructure firms, both to collect information and, perhaps in some cases, to have a foothold into networks in the event of a conflict, according to some US officials and private sector experts. Attacks on critical infrastructure ""The concern is that effort that we've seen [Russian groups] actively use disruptive effects around the globe,"" Rob Joyce, head of the National Security Agency's Cybersecurity Directorate, said at the Aspen Cyber Summit last week. ""And we've seen evidence of prepositioning against US critical infrastructure. So, all things that can't be tolerated and we need to work against."" One such group, known as Berserk Bear in the cybersecurity industry, has been linked to breaches of industrial software at US electric utilities that the Department of Homeland Security blamed on Russian government hackers in 2018. The group, which some analysts have linked to Russia's FSB intelligence agency, has in the last three years shown a steady appetite for collecting data held by critical infrastructure firms in the US, Ukraine and Western Europe. That includes breaches, in 2019 and 2020 respectively, of the websites of one Ukraine's largest energy firms and San Francisco's International Airport, according to Joe Slowik, a former cybersecurity specialist in the US Navy who now works at security firm Gigamon. Over a decade of operations breaching critical infrastructure firms, Berserk Bear ""has almost certainly facilitated significant intelligence gathering, capability development and potentially effects pre-positioning in highly sensitive networks,"" Slowik said in a paper that will be presented at the Virus Bulletin conference this week.",20,2.0578782491376337,4.263567493667995,-2.205689244530361,2

The FBI and law enforcement agencies in France and Ukraine coordinated the raid, which led to the seizure of $375,000 in cash and two luxury vehicles, and the freezing of $1.3 million in cryptocurrencies, according to Europol. The arrests are a notable win for US law enforcement, which has tried to step up its pressure on cybercriminals based in Eastern Europe and Russia following a series of ransomware attacks that have cost US companies millions of dollars. Europol described the two suspects as ""prolific,"" having demanded between €5 and €70 million ($5.8 million and $81.3 million) from victims. But a spokesperson for the EU's law enforcement arm declined to identify the two people or what type of ransomware they allegedly used, citing legal reasons and an ongoing investigation. ""The organized crime group is suspected of having committed a string of targeted attacks against very large industrial groups in Europe and North America from April 2020 onwards,"" Europol spokesperson Claire Georges said. Four FBI personnel were in Ukraine to help coordinate the raid, according to the Europol statement. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment. Mark Arena, CEO of cybersecurity firm Intel 471, said he believed the two people arrested were ""affiliates,"" rather than ""core operators,"" of a well-known ransomware service. ""A number of actors use or have used multiple ransomware services, hence we caution against any linking of this action to a single specific ransomware service,"" Arena told CNN. John Fokker, a former cybercrime investigator with the Dutch police, said that it often takes years for law enforcement agencies to ""build a solid case"" against ransomware gangs, which publicly boast about their victims but operate in the shadows. In this case, Europol said investigators held a dozen meetings in preparation for the raid. ""Ukraine has proven to be willing and committed to arrest ransomware criminals within its borders — something which has been a bigger challenge with Russia,"" Fokker, who is now head of cyber investigations at McAfee Enterprise, told CNN. President Joe Biden in June urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to crack down on cybercriminals operating from Russian soil, but US officials have been skeptical of Moscow's willingness to do so. The White House plans later this month to convene a 30-country meeting to ramp up global efforts to address the threat of ransomware, as CNN first reported.",20,2.5545369677162797,6.7096054320224745,-4.155068464306195,2

In an exclusive CNN investigation released Tuesday, three former high-ranking Ukrainian military intelligence officials described how they attempted to lure suspected war criminals out of Russia to face prosecution for acts of violence committed in eastern Ukraine, where separatists backed by Moscow have been fighting for years. The operation failed when the Russians were arrested in Minsk last year. Speaking in Kiev after a closed briefing about the sting, a parliamentarian from Ukrainian President Zelensky's ruling party, Maryana Bezuhla, confirmed to journalists there was a Ukrainian operation to gather intelligence and arrest suspected Russian war criminals. ""There was a special measure as part of the routine work of intelligence officers to collect information about those who participated in aggression...At the initiative of the SBU [Security Service of Ukraine], the next event was opened to try to pull a certain number of people out of the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Bezuhla said. Bezuhla, who heads a parliamentary commission which investigates ""illegal actions"" of officials, said there will be an investigation into how the operation became known to Belarusian special services.

2021-06-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/07/politics/president-joe-biden-cyber-attacks-russia-putin-trump-economy/index.html,Ransomware attacks saddle Biden with grave national security crisis,"The Biden administration Sunday confronted the implications of a sudden and grave national security challenge as ransom-demanding cyber hackers target the staples of American life -- food, gas, water, hospitals and transport. The assaults, which have led the FBI director to make comparisons to 9/11, are targeting the country's vulnerable infrastructure as it struggles back to life after pandemic shutdowns and are putting civilians on the front lines of an invisible conflict likely to defy quick fixes to lessen the threat. They leave President Joe Biden, who took office amid multiple crises, with thorny dilemmas about how to respond without escalating a full-on international cyber war and expose him to new political vulnerability. Many of the attacks appear to be the work of criminal gangs on Russian soil, heaping more pressure on the President's already tense, high-stakes summit next week with President Vladimir Putin during his first foreign trip. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a congressional hearing on Monday that Biden would make clear when he saw the Russian leader that ""states cannot be in the business of harboring those who are engaged in these kinds of attacks."" His comment came after Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm Sunday warned that ""very malign actors"" had the US in their sights after attacks on a pipeline, government agencies, a Florida water system, schools, health care institutions and, even last week, the meat industry and a ferry service to millionaire's playground Martha's Vineyard. ""Even as we speak, there are thousands of attacks on all aspects of the energy sector and the private sector generally ... it's happening all the time,"" Granholm told Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Alarmingly, the former Michigan governor said that foreign hackers have the capability to shut down the US power network, and counseled firms against paying ransoms demanded by hackers. A price to pay Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, warned that the US was now reaping the consequences for failing to respond sufficiently boldly to past attacks by China, Russia and North Korea. ""We have been a cheap date. And you can't defend yourself simply by bobbing and weaving and patching. The adversary has to understand they will pay a price, there will be a cost for attacking the United States or for attacking our critical infrastructure,"" King said, also on ""State of the Union."" The frank comments from the senator and the secretary followed even more strident warnings from FBI Director Christopher Wray, who put the threat in perspective with striking language in a Wall Street Journal interview last week. He agreed there were similarities in the challenges posed by ransomware hackers, who implant computer code that locks systems until victims pay up, to those of the September 11, 2001, when al Qaeda operatives plotted the worst terror attack in US history. ""There are a lot of parallels,"" Wray said, adding that the US government, the private sector and individual Americans needed to recognize the menace. The Justice Department signaled it plans to coordinate its anti-ransomware efforts with the same protocols as it does for terrorism. Like the attackers on 9/11, hackers are exploiting gaps in US security systems, and raising questions about the capacity of US intelligence agencies and government departments to combine effectively to thwart attacks. Unlike after the attacks on New York and the Pentagon in 2001, the new threat is exposing fractured US political unity. Republicans were quick to seize on the aftermath of the recent hack on the Colonial Pipeline that sparked gas shortages, panic buying and long lines at the pumps last month to suggest Biden was weak and had lost control. Ex-President Donald Trump, who is seeking a political comeback, claimed Saturday that cyberattacks showed lost respect for US leaders since he left office. Such political opportunism raises doubts over whether Biden would be able to unite Washington around him, if he needed to muster a counter-attack from a major breach of US cyber defenses by a hostile foreign power. Biden to plot defense then go on offense Given the wide scope of the attacks, the White House must hurriedly muster the defenses of a vulnerable private sector while planning responses that can, as King suggests, make culprits pay a painful price. Biden has already signed an executive order requiring his government to make ""bold changes"" and ""significant investments"" to protect the nation's digital infrastructure that is meant to spur similar precautions by private firms. On Thursday, the National Security Council's top cyber official, Anne Neuberger, wrote an open letter to corporate executives sounding the alarm and warning the private sector needs to do much better. And quickly. ""All organizations must recognize that no company is safe from being targeted by ransomware, regardless of size or location,"" Neuberger wrote. But given the huge cost of sweeping changes to cybersecurity posture and security, and the fact that all it takes is one computer user to inadvertently open the gateway to cyber attackers through malware, swiftly ensuring comprehensive protection in the corporate sector is a tough challenge. John Negroponte, the first director of national intelligence -- a post created to fix intelligence agency dysfunction revealed by the 9/11 attacks -- said Biden's executive order was excellent and praised Neuberger in an appearance on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Friday. But he argued the government may need to force private firms to do more to disclose cyberattacks, saying that a serious attack, for instance, on a health care system could cost lives and cause a deep economic impact. ""I think there's been a reluctance to move because I think the private sector has resisted being compelled to cooperate in certain areas. And I think ultimately, there is going to have to be legislation,"" Negroponte said. A showdown with Putin The FBI has said that the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline was likely orchestrated by the ransomware network known as DarkSide, which experts suspect is based in Russia. The White House said last week that an attack on JBS USA, one of the world's largest food companies, was the work of a ""criminal organization likely based in Russia."" The new assaults mean even greater scrutiny for Biden's summit in Geneva with Putin on June 16. The US and Russia are already divided by election interference, Moscow's pressure on Ukraine, human rights and strategic issues. But the US President will now be under even more pressure to publicly lay down the law to a rival who has managed at various times to outfox the last three US Presidents. Biden last week offered a cursory ""No"" when asked whether Putin was testing him. Putin, with the poker face of a former KGB officer, last week said accusations against Moscow were nonsense, Reuters reported. The fact that the attacks are blamed on private firms gives Putin a veneer of deniability. But given the nature of the Russian security state and the nexus between organized crime and the intelligence services, it is fair to conclude that Putin could stop the attacks if he wanted to. In fact, the attacks appear to align with the Russian leader's interests. The thrust of his foreign policy over the last decade or so has been to weaken the United States in order to enhance Russia's relative power and prestige. The chaos and political recriminations sparked by cyberattacks are paralleled by the internal discord sown by what US spy agencies say is Russia's disinformation and propaganda warfare during the last two US election campaigns -- on behalf of Trump. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said Sunday that the Russians need to start paying a price for tacit acceptance of criminal ransomware attacks. ""You really have to treat Russia like it's virtually a criminal enterprise,"" Blunt said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""You know, they harbor criminals, they don't appreciate the rule of law or any kind of level of personal freedom. And I do think we have to push back."" Retaliation is a danger in itself The question of what kind of retaliation the US should launch is a fraught one. To begin with, the cyber warfare battlefield is in the shadows, meaning there is little public evidence of actions the US may already have taken or the cathartic satisfaction of visible reprisals. But any counter-attacks need to be calibrated to avoid an escalation that could not only cause a dangerous standoff between the US and other nuclear powers but could also simply invite more attacks on US soil. In April, the administration announced sanctions, including for Russia's interference in the 2020 US election and the attack on software developer SolarWinds -- one of the worst data breaches to ever hit the US government. But there is little evidence of an effective deterrence. Microsoft recently said that hackers who are part of the same Russian group behind the SolarWinds hack have struck against more than 150 government agencies, think tanks and other organizations in the US and elsewhere. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told CNN in an interview last month that the US has the ""capability to conduct offensive operations"" and also to defend itself -- but refused to specify exactly what the US might do. That is Biden's problem as he wrestles with yet another cascading crisis.",20,4.218066817978075,3.6208839603480474,0.5971828576300275,2

Suddenly, they opened fire on the two men guarding a darkened warehouse with broken windows. Moving past the fallen guards, an American voice - among the mix of men speaking accented English -- shouted at two others in a car: ""Get out! Hurry up, hurry up."" The team of US Navy SEALs, along with Romanian and Spanish Special Forces, quickly and quietly worked their way through the warehouse, firing on enemy fighters and, when possible, taking them prisoner. When the operation was done, the assaulting team -- whose ammunition had consisted of plastic projectiles and paint rounds -- was told by an instructor they had passed the course and to get back in position to run it again. Exclusive access The SEALs, from Virginia Beach, are in Romania this month as part of a contingent of American special forces taking part in the ""Trojan Footprint"" military exercises across five Eastern European countries that involve 600 NATO and non-NATO forces, including troops from Ukraine and Georgia, which have both been invaded by Russia in recent years. The training is taking place alongside this month's much larger Defender-Europe 21 NATO joint exercises, which have some 28,000 forces participating from 26 different countries. Both sets of military training exercises, while long-planned, follow a series of aggressive Russian military moves across Europe. CNN was given exclusive access to see the American special forces - the SEALs and US Army's Green Berets - exercise in Romania and North Macedonia over several days. In central Romania, the Green Berets fast roped and rappelled down from helicopters alongside Ukrainian and Romanian soldiers before blasting and shooting their way into a makeshift house. In North Macedonia, American special air tactics airmen taught local troops how to call in targets for an AC-130 plane that was firing on a distant ridgeline, the Macedonians carefully annunciating the coordinates in halting English. One salvo, called in by an American officer, was significantly off target, appearing to be the result of a misunderstanding between the ground and air forces: A potentially deadly mistake that spoke to why live fire training is so vital. The annual exercises were canceled last year during the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and while they are over a year in the making, it is lost on no one that they coincide with a dramatic escalation of tension between Russia and the West. ""We have to be strong and supportive of our allies when there is a threat,"" said David Muniz, the most senior US diplomat in Romania who serves as the embassy's chargé d'affaires. ""When we are strong, when we are united, it has a real chilling effect, shall we say, on the kinds of things that can happen."" ""In this way, you cut down on the chance for mischief,"" he added, shortly before American paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division poured out of transport planes over a Romanian airfield in Boboc. While some Russian forces have recently pulled back from their deployment to the border with Ukraine, Russia's navy has also carried out exercises in the Black Sea, challenged Ukrainian Coast Guard vessels in the same waters and closed down parts of the small sea around the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow invaded and annexed in 2014. Few diplomatic or military officials -- American or otherwise - wanted to speak specifically about the Russian threat though several privately admitted there's no doubt it is hanging over these exercises. ""It's just showing everybody that we have a capability and we can use it when necessary,"" said Major General Joe Jarrard, the deputy commander of the US Army in Europe and Africa, downplaying the significance of the timing of the exercises. ""We're going to continue to develop our readiness and the interoperability between all of the allies and partners and so that's what we're continuing to focus on."" The head of Romania's special forces, which copied much from the Americans during the development of their forces, admitted that the Russian maneuvers not far from their coastline in the Black Sea are unsettling. ""They should be of concern for us,"" said Lieutenant General Daniel Petrescu. ""Our job is to train harder and harder and be prepared for everything."" Since April, the US has sanctioned Russia for its interference in the 2020 election, the SolarWinds hack and the poisoning of activist Alexey Navalny. The two sides have expelled a number of each other's diplomats. Ahead of a proposed summit between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin in June, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Ukraine, where he cautioned that Russia could reverse a recent withdrawal of some of the tens of thousands of troops that had amassed along the border with Ukraine. ""Russia has the capacity on fairly short notice to take aggressive action if it so chooses, and so we are watching this very, very carefully,"" Blinken said in a May 6 press conference with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We discussed in some detail the support that we're providing, we'll continue to provide to Ukraine to continue to strengthen its security, its defenses,"" Blinken said. From the Black Sea, Russia could also launch an attack on Ukraine's mainland, the former commander of NATO, James Stavridis wrote in a recent column. ""The objective would be to neutralize the Ukrainian naval forces, gain complete sea control in the northern Black Sea, cut off Ukrainian military forces from their supply lines, and obtain dominance over a section of land that could connect Russia with Crimea,"" Stavridis wrote. Last month, the Pentagon scratched plans to send two destroyers into the Black Sea but the US Coast Guard has sent the Hamilton cutter, which the Navy's 6th Fleet said was there ""to support NATO allies and partners."" It has been photographed being shadowed by a Russian patrol vessel. A Russian attack on Ukraine would not necessarily compel the US and the rest of NATO to intervene, since it is not part of the alliance. NATO did not respond militarily to Russia's annexation of Crimea but has refused to recognize it as Russian territory. A big part of the aim of the NATO exercises now, beyond sending a message to Russia and others, is simply at a tactical level: should the allies and partners need to join a fight together, they know how to work alongside each other and cross-pollinate with other countries' equipment. ""It's just to build that knowledge with each other,"" said a Green Beret operator who CNN wasn't allowed to identify. ""It shows that we're willing to learn from each other. It is important, significant, whatever's going on around the world.""",4,4.323514150237621,4.1026368340627775,0.2208773161748434,6

In an exclusive and wide-ranging interview, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also touched on the buildup of Russian forces on Ukraine's border, potential military support from the United States, and President Joe Biden's offer of a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Kuleba's comments about Donald Trump's fraught term in the White House follow the 2019 scandal involving Trump and allegations that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival Biden and his son, Hunter ahead of the 2020 election. The long-running crisis upended politics in Washington, and evolved into a full-blown impeachment investigation -- of which Trump was later acquitted. Kuleba said of the Trump administration: ""It was a difficult time and at that point we were all focused on one thing ... on maintaining bipartisan support in the United States."" The minister added that the Ukrainian government will continue to invest in relations with both Democrats and Republicans in the US to ensure relations between the two countries are on more ""solid ground."" Giuliani was 'playing politics' Kuleba also told CNN that he was ""not aware"" of any formal request for assistance from the FBI, concerning Trump's long-time attorney Rudy Giuliani. Last month, federal agents executed a search warrant at the Manhattan home of Giuliani in connection with a long-running criminal investigation into his involvement with Ukraine in the latter years of Trump's presidency. Kuleba said Ukraine would be ""open to helping"" any FBI request, as the country has ""nothing to hide."" The minister added that he could not say if Giuliani acted criminally. But Kuleba said that ""he was definitely playing politics and he put the situation at risk for Ukraine, and for the country's relationship with Washington."" ""We did our best to avoid the trap and maintain that bipartisan support from the United States."" Creeping annexation Secretary of State Blinken's visit to Ukraine on Wednesday comes at another delicate moment in the country's relationship with Russia, amid a buildup of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border and in Crimea. ""[We are] gravely concerned,"" Kuleba said of the movements. ""I think every country would be extremely concerned seeing how hundreds and thousands of troops and heavy military machinery is being masked along your border."" Kuleba raised concerns about Russia's recent assertion in what should be shared waters between Ukraine and Russia in the Sea of Azov calling it a ""creeping annexation."" In a show of force, Moscow recently sealed off the strategic Sea of Azov to non-Russian state vessels until October in what Ukraine says is a violation of international law, and against a 2003 agreement between Ukraine and Russia to share the waters. ""The Sea of Azov...is low hanging fruit for Russia. After the illegal annexation of Crimea and the takeover of the control over the Kerch Strait, Russia can conduct this creeping annexation of the Sea of Azov. And it's constantly reinforcing its military presence there and disrupting trade routes,"" Kuleba told CNN. The massing of Russian troops in the region over recent weeks has reignited tensions in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists demanding independence from Kiev since 2014. The Kremlin has repeatedly said these are just military exercises, but Kuleba rejected any suggestion that the risk posed by Russia was being overstated, saying the threat was ""real."" ""When green men appeared in Crimea in 2014, Russia claimed these were not their soldiers, that it was not Russia and yet the peninsula was illegally occupied by Russian military forces,"" he said. ""Green men"" is the Ukrainian term for professional soldiers wearing Russian combat fatigues but no identifying insignia. ""So at least today, they admit that it's them, but they're just exercising. But even if it's just an exercise, what they've been exercising is an encirclement of Ukraine, and offensive operations against Ukraine."" NATO membership Amid this tension, Kuleba said he would be discussing a ""list"" of US military support with Blinken, when he arrives in Kiev. As part of this, Ukraine will request air defense systems and anti-sniper technology, said Kuleba. ""I want to make it clear that it's not only about receiving it from the United States, but also about buying it from the United States,"" he added. ""We want this partnership to work both ways. It should be mutually beneficial."" Kuleba said he wants Ukraine to be treated by the United States as the ""eastern border of democracy"" in the central Europe and Black Sea region and be integrated into the West -- including NATO. Indeed the minister believes Ukraine's ascension to NATO will arrive in only a matter of time. ""The path to NATO membership is absolutely on the table already ... NATO membership does not come in a day. We have plenty of time to settle the conflict. But we have to have a clear a step by step road map of our accession to NATO. And this is where the United States can help us."" 'Beautiful piece of diplomacy' As for Biden's recent offer of a summit with Putin, Kuleba was optimistic, calling it ""a beautiful piece of diplomacy."" He believed the summit offer ""bought time,"" as Putin would not break rules while a meeting is being planned to discuss the rules -- even if not all Ukrainians saw it that way. ""I understand those who do feel anxious (about the summit), because of the lack of information, because of conspiracy theories, because of the inherited fear of betrayal,"" he said. ""But I see it from another perspective -- from the professional diplomatic perspective. And I do not see anything that would go against the interests of Ukraine, at least at this point,"" Kuleba added.

2021-04-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/30/politics/rudy-giuliani-russia-influence-campaign/index.html,Washington Post corrects report that Giuliani was warned he was target of Russian influence campaign,"The FBI in late 2019 knew Rudy Giuliani was the target of a Russian influence operation intended to damage now-President Joe Biden in the 2020 election by spreading falsehoods, but never directly warned him about the concern despite earlier reporting suggesting Giuliani had been briefed, according to reporting from The Washington Post that was corrected on Saturday. Officials planned to warn Giuliani, then-President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, that he was at risk of being used by Russia in its attempts to sway the 2020 election, the Post reported, citing current and former US officials. On Saturday, the Post issued a correction to its reporting on Thursday that Giuliani was directly warned by the FBI in 2019 that he was a target of the Russian operation. The Post's correction at the top of its article stated: ""An earlier version of this story, published Thursday, incorrectly reported that One America News was warned by the FBI that it was the target of a Russian influence operation. That version also said the FBI had provided a similar warning to Rudolph W. Giuliani, which he has since disputed. This version has been corrected to remove assertions that OAN and Giuliani received the warnings."" CNN had not confirmed that report and Giuliani's attorney, Robert Costello, denied that Giuliani was warned about the Russian intelligence effort. ""This story is totally false according to Mayor Giuliani. He never received any such briefing,"" Costello told CNN on Friday. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment to the Post. Shani George, a spokesperson for The Washington Post, declined to provide additional comment when reached by CNN. In 2019, Giuliani was on a mission to find damaging information on Trump's 2020 election opponent Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. He met with Kremlin-tied associates who were attempting to influence the 2020 election, and publicly pushed misleading and unsubstantiated claims that were part of a Russia disinformation campaign. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN that the Trump White House was warned that some of the information being passed to Giuliani was from foreign intelligence, and some members of Congress also were warned by FBI counterintelligence. Giuliani has been the focus of an investigation concerning his activities in Ukraine, including whether he conducted illegal lobbying for Ukrainian officials while he pursued an investigation linked to now-President Biden, CNN has reported. Giuliani hasn't been charged and has denied wrongdoing. On Wednesday, federal agents executed search warrants at Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and office, and people familiar with the matter tell CNN the probe is now focused primarily on Giuliani's Ukraine-linked activities. Ron Johnson briefing The Post reported that the FBI gave a ""defensive briefing"" last August to Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who, as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security committee at the time, was leading an investigation into the Bidens for Hunter Biden's role on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. In the report that Johnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, issued last year on their investigation, they said they were briefed by the FBI. But they argued that the briefings were not an effort to discourage them from conducting their investigation. The Republicans wrote that the FBI briefed the committees in March 2020 and briefed Johnson and Grassley in August. ""On Aug. 6, 2020, Chairman Grassley and Chairman Johnson received another briefing from the FBI on behalf of the IC, in which the FBI stated that it is not attempting to 'quash, curtail, or interfere' in the investigation in any way,"" the report says. In a statement, Johnson confirmed to CNN that he received a defensive briefing from the FBI. ""Regarding reports that I received an FBI briefing warning me that I was a target of Russian disinformation, I can confirm I received such a briefing in August of 2020,"" the Wisconsin Republican said. ""I asked the briefers what specific evidence they had regarding this warning, and they could not provide me anything other than the generalized warning. Without specific information, I felt the briefing was completely useless and unnecessary (since I was fully aware of the dangers of Russian disinformation). ""Because there was no substance to the briefing, and because it followed the production and leaking of a false intelligence product by Democrat leaders, I suspected that the briefing was being given to be used at some future date for the purpose that it is now being used: to offer the biased media an opportunity to falsely accuse me of being a tool of Russia despite warnings,"" Johnson added. ""To this day, I have not been told who ordered the completely unnecessary — but politically useful to my opponents — briefing."" Democrats warned in a letter last year to the FBI that Johnson was being sent information from entities with ties to Russia as part of a disinformation campaign targeting Biden. Johnson and Grassley disputed this, accusing Democrats of spreading disinformation. Kremlin influence campaign CNN has previously reported that Giuliani and other allies of the former President publicly aligned with Kremlin-linked figures, even as the US government warned that they were spreading lies. The Trump White House was warned in 2019 that Giuliani ""was being used to feed Russian misinformation"" to the President, which the Post first reported in October 2020. US intelligence agencies warned the White House that Giuliani ""was the target of an influence operation by Russian intelligence"" in which Trump was the intended recipient of the misinformation, according to the newspaper. Giuliani traveled to Ukraine in December 2019 where he met with Andrii Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker that the Trump administration in September deemed an ""active Russian agent"" and sanctioned for attempting to influence the election. The US intelligence community had previously singled Derkach out for assisting in Moscow's efforts to try and weaken Biden in the election. Giuliani had collaborated with Derkach to spread anti-Biden material during Trump's first impeachment trial. Democrats have also charged that Derkach sent information to Johnson, who had denied receiving anything from Derkach and instead accused Democrats of themselves spreading Russian disinformation with the allegation. The US intelligence community said in a landmark report in March that the Russian government meddled in the 2020 election with an influence campaign ""denigrating"" Biden and ""supporting"" Trump. ""A key element of Moscow's strategy this election cycle was its use of proxies linked to Russian intelligence to push influence narratives -- including misleading or unsubstantiated allegations against President Biden -- to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration,"" the report said. UPDATE: The headline and story have been updated to reflect The Washington Post corrected its story to remove an assertion the FBI warned Rudy Giuliani directly of a Russian influence campaign.",20,4.544569031426303,5.307314211216472,-0.7627451797901683,19
2021-04-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/29/politics/military-intel-leader-russia/index.html,Top US military intelligence official says Russian military poses an 'existential threat' to the US,"The top US military intelligence official said during a congressional hearing on Thursday that the Russian military is an ""existential threat"" to the United States. ""The Russian military is an existential threat to the United States,"" Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about worldwide threats. Berrier said the country's military is being used to maintain influence over states ""along its periphery, compete with US global primacy and compel adversaries who challenge Russia's vital national interests."" ""Moscow continues to invest in its strategic nuclear forces, in new capabilities to enhance its strategic deterrent, and that places the US homeland at risk,"" Berrier said. Berrier's comments come as tensions between Russia and the US remain high. The US unveiled sanctions against Moscow earlier this month over its interference in the 2020 US presidential election, the SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and ""severe human rights abuses"" in Crimea. President Joe Biden told a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night that Russia's ""actions will have consequences if they turn out to be true, and they turned out to be true,"" referring to Moscow's interference in the election and the SolarWinds cyberattack. ""So I responded directly and proportionately to Russia's interference in our elections and cyberattacks on our government and our businesses -- they did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have. But we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interests,"" Biden said. The White House is hammering out the details of a possible European summit between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could happen as soon as early summer, according to sources familiar with the planning. Tensions high but a summit could take place Russia has not yet responded officially to the United States' offer of a summit, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday. ""We are still looking into this proposal and analyzing the situation,"" Peskov said. ""Each time Washington's words about the summit meeting are accompanied by words about the need for Russia to pay some kind of price and about inevitable sanctions. So of course, deep analysis is required here."" Russia appeared to be pulling back from a possible confrontation with the West last week as Russian state media reported that troops were returning to their bases after taking part in exercises near the border with Ukraine and in Crimea. A buildup of Russian troops along the border in recent weeks had reignited tensions in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists demanding independence from Kiev since 2014. ""At present, military units and formations are marching to railway stations, airfields, loading onto landing ships, railway platforms and military transport aircraft,"" Tass reported on April 23, citing the Ministry of Defense. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu's announcement came weeks after Moscow initiated the largest buildup of troops near the Ukrainian border since 2014. It was unclear from the announcement how many troops would remain in the region. Berrier emphasized that the Russian military's power comes from its investment into and development of nuclear weapons as well as its ""conventional force largely postured for defensive and regional operations."" ""Russia has a growing ability to project power with long-range precision cruise missiles and limited expeditionary capabilities,"" he added. Berrier pointed out that Russian military leaders are ""incorporating lessons from Russia's involvement in Syria into training and exercises."" When questioned by Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican, about Russia's nuclear warhead development, Berrier confirmed Defense Intelligence Agency assessments from 2018 that stated Russia is updating its nuclear warhead production complex and is producing ""hundreds of nuclear warheads each year,"" saying those assessments are still valid. Berrier also confirmed that while the US is adhering to the nuclear testing moratorium, Russia is not. ""The United States believes that Russia probably is not adhering to the nuclear testing moratorium in the manner consistent with the yield, or with the zero yield standard. The United States, by contrast, is upholding a zero yield standard, end quote,"" Fischer said. ""Does that still remain DIA's assessment?"" ""It does, Senator,"" Berrier said.",4,3.7065660784028074,3.3313082197818846,0.37525785862092276,16
2021-04-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/22/europe/russia-military-ukraine-border-exercises-intl/index.html,Russia pulls back troops after massive buildup near Ukraine border,"Russia appeared to be pulling back from a confrontation with the West on Friday as state media reported that troops were returning to their bases after taking part in exercises near the border with Ukraine and in Crimea. A buildup of Russian troops along the border in recent weeks had reignited tensions in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists demanding independence from Kiev since 2014. But on Thursday Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu suddenly declared that the troops had completed their drills in the south of the country near Ukraine and Crimea, and would return to their permanent bases by May 1. ""I believe that the objectives of the snap drill have been fully achieved. The troops have demonstrated the ability to provide a reliable defense of the country,"" Shoigu said at a meeting in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Kiev in 2014. ""At present, military units and formations are marching to railway stations, airfields, loading onto landing ships, railway platforms and military transport aircraft,"" Tass reported on Friday, citing the Ministry of Defense. Shoigu's announcement came weeks after Moscow initiated the largest buildup of troops near the Ukrainian border since 2014. It was unclear from Thursday's announcement how many troops would remain in the region. More than 10,000 servicemen and 1,200 units of weapons and military equipment took part in the ""snap inspection"" according to Tass. Ukrainian military officials told CNN earlier this month they estimate an extra 50,000 Russian troops had gathered in recent weeks across the Russia-Ukraine border and in Crimea. The European Union put the figure even higher, estimating on Tuesday that more than 100,000 troops had amassed near the border and in Crimea. State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Thursday acknowledged Russia's announcement, saying that the US would continue to closely monitor the situation with Ukrainian officials and other allies, but added that ""what we'll be looking for is action."" ""We have made clear in our engagement with the Russian government that it needs to refrain from escalatory actions and immediately cease all its aggressive activity in and around Ukraine, including its recent military buildup in occupied Crimea, and on Ukraine's border, and its intention to block specific vessels in the parts of the Black Sea,"" Price said at a briefing Thursday. Some weapons from Russia's 41st army, which include tanks and heavy artillery, will be left behind until the joint Russian-Belarusian Zapad-2021 strategic military exercises take place in September, according to Russian state news agency TASS. That leaves Russia with more firepower on the Ukrainian border than it had previously. Conflict Intelligence Team, a Russian open-source intelligence group that has been monitoring Russia's aggressive military buildup on the border, suggested Thursday that it was too early to judge whether the news amounted to a de-escalation. ""By our assessment, the forces remaining at Ukraine's border still present a danger of deployment into occupied Eastern Ukraine, while a large-scale invasion of government-controlled territory would certainly require moving more troops to the border,"" CIT said on Twitter. On Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said more than 20 ships had taken part in exercises in the Black Sea, which borders both countries. ""A unit of ships consisting of frigates ""Admiral Makarov"" and ""Admiral Essen"", small missile ships ""Grayvoron"" and ""Vyshny Volochek"", as well as missile boats, small anti-submarine ships and large amphibious ships conducted an exercise to repel air attack means of a simulated enemy using active electronic jamming and the conditional use of air defense means,"" a ministry statement read. Shoigu, who oversaw the drills in annexed Crimea near Ukraine's southern border on Thursday, said Russia's military had to be ready to respond swiftly to any ""unfavorable"" development given NATO's ongoing Defender-Europe military exercises. Defender-Europe is an annual, large-scale US Army-led multinational exercise designed to build readiness and interoperability between the US and its NATO partner militaries. It was canceled last year over coronavirus concerns. ""Every year in Europe, the Alliance conducts up to 40 major operational training events with a clear anti-Russian focus. In the spring of this year, the combined armed forces of NATO began the most ambitious exercise in the past 30 years,"" Shoigu said. He accused the military and political leadership of Ukraine of seeking to destabilize the situation in the Donbass conflict zone, and said the United States and NATO continued to conduct ""provocative activities"" in the airspace and waters of the Black Sea. The NATO alliance has expressed deep concern over the Russian military buildup near Ukraine, described by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last week as ""part of a broader pattern of Russian aggressive action. ""Allies fully support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and we call on Russia to de-escalate immediately, stop its pattern of aggressive provocations and respect its international commitments,"" he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday invited President Vladimir Putin to meet in the Donbass, urging his Russian counterpart to restore a ceasefire in the eastern region where he said ""millions of lives"" are at stake. Putin said Thursday he was willing to discuss bilateral relations with Zelensky in the Russian capital, TASS reported. Ukraine has been trying to bolster international support in its deadlock with Moscow, and has urged its Western allies to pledge new sanctions to discourage the Kremlin from resorting to more military force. In his speech on Tuesday, Zelensky called on Ukrainian citizens to unite in the face of the Russian military threat. ""Ukraine and Russia, despite their common past, look to the future differently. We are we. You are you. But this is not necessarily a problem, it is an opportunity. At the very least -- an opportunity, before it's too late, to stop the deadly mathematics of future military losses."" He blamed Russia for refusing to support a ""general statement"" to restore a full ceasefire in the area, despite ""the support of all parties."" In his annual address to the nation on Wednesday, Putin warned foreign powers not to cross Moscow's ""red lines,"" but made no mention of the military buildup near Ukraine. Last week, the Ukrainian President met in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- who joined via video link -- to discuss the deteriorating security situation in eastern Ukraine and the occupation of Ukrainian territories. The three leaders ended their meeting calling on Russia to withdraw extra troops amassed on the Ukrainian border.

2021-04-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/15/politics/russia-sanctions-takeaways/index.html,Six key takeaways from Biden's Russia sanctions announcement,"The Biden administration slapped sweeping sanctions on Russia Thursday over Moscow's alleged interference in the 2020 election, the massive SolarWinds hack and the ongoing occupation of Crimea, signaling it is adopting a tougher posture toward the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions announcement also showed that the Biden administration is more willing to directly call out Russia's meddling in US affairs after Trump administration officials had to dance around former President Donald Trump's frequent unwillingness to criticize Moscow. Here are the key takeaways from Thursday's sanctions: Sanctions now align with the President's rhetoric The Trump administration was more than willing to issue sanctions against Russia, and did so on multiple occasions, including over the occupation of Crimea, the poisoning of an ex-spy in the United Kingdom, and even election interference. But those actions were taken while Trump himself repeatedly refused to condemn Russia's actions. He would not acknowledge Russia's election interference in 2016, bristling at the notion Russia helped his campaign, even as his top national security officials unanimously said they agreed with the intelligence community assessment that Moscow interfered. It went beyond the 2016 election, however. Last year, Trump declined to condemn Russia over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. He and his top officials downplayed Russia's meddling in the 2020 election, arguing China was a bigger threat -- a claim contradicted by last month's intelligence community report on 2020 foreign election interference. President Joe Biden has been vocal in his criticisms of Putin, calling him a ""killer"" last month and saying Moscow would ""pay a price"" for its election interference efforts. The sanctions issued Thursday back up that rhetoric. Biden informed Putin in a call this week he was imposing the sanctions, and he's seeking a ""stable and predictable"" relationship with Russia, a senior administration official said Thursday. Sanctions are strongest US response to date to massive hack The Russia sanctions are the Biden administration's most significant step yet in responding to the SolarWinds hacking campaign, which has compromised at least nine federal agencies and dozens of private organizations. Under Thursday's new executive order, the administration imposed sanctions on six Russian tech companies that it said have supported Russian intelligence. Russian agencies including the FSB, GRU and SVR have conducted ""some of the most dangerous and disruptive cyber attacks in recent history,"" the Treasury Department said in announcing the sanctions. US intelligence agencies on Thursday issued a technical advisory warning of the tactics used by Russian agents to compromise network security. The Biden administration also said it is exploring whether to invoke Trump's executive order on technology supply chains to introduce additional policies aimed at preventing Russian cyberattacks in the future. Russian hacking has long been a problem for the US government. The goal of Thursday's sanctions is to deter Moscow, though it remains to be seen whether they will actually have that effect. Flicking at collusion, all these years later With one sentence in a 2,000-word press release, the Treasury Department perhaps did more to lay out the case for potential Trump-Russia collusion in the 2016 election than has happened before. The Treasury statement confirmed that Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian-linked intelligence operative, provided Russian intelligence with ""with sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy."" He got that inside information from Trump campaign officials. While the sanctions issued Thursday were tied to Russia's 2020 election interference efforts -- which the US says Kilimnik played a role in -- the reference to his meddling in 2016 is perhaps the bigger revelation. It has long been suspected but never explicitly stated by the US government that Kilimnik passed internal Trump campaign data from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to Russian intelligence services. The announcement Thursday establishes a simple and direct channel of communication from the upper echelon of the Trump campaign to the Russian agencies that were meddling to help Trump win. During the early stages of the Russia probe, officials from both parties said this kind of covert relationship between the Trump campaign and the Russians would constitute ""collusion."" This revelation was a long time coming. It took years for special counsel Robert Mueller's team to reveal that Manafort provided internal campaign information to Kilimnik. About a year later, the Senate Intelligence Committee openly called Kilimnik a Russian agent. But neither went so far as to say Kilimnik gave the information to the Russian government. Thursday's announcement closes the loop. After criticism of Trump, no action on Russian bounties Then-candidate Biden repeatedly criticized Trump for failing to take action after being presented intelligence that Russia had placed bounties on US troops in Afghanistan. On Thursday, a senior Biden administration official said the US intelligence community had only ""low to moderate confidence"" in the information about bounties, and said Biden was not taking action to punish Moscow on the issue. The fact that Biden declined to issue sanctions over the bounties shows is yet another example of why governing is always more complicated than campaigning, particularly when it comes to foreign policy. ""Not only has he failed to sanction or impose any kind of consequences on Russia for this egregious violation of international law, Donald Trump has continued his embarrassing campaign of deference and debasing himself before Vladimir Putin,"" Biden said during a virtual town hall in June 2020. In a first telephone call with Putin in January, Biden raised the issue of bounties. But three months later, his administration is stopping short of punishing Moscow based on an intelligence assessment that relied on detainee information that was collected in a ""difficult operating environment"" in Afghanistan. ""We have conveyed through diplomatic and intelligence channels strong direct messages on this issue,"" a senior administration official said, saying that if a pattern of behavior continues -- presumably with a greater degree of confidence -- the US would respond. GOP knocks Biden for not issuing pipeline sanctions Congressional Republicans praised the Biden administration for taking action against Russia, but they were critical that the sanctions announced Thursday did not include any action to try to prevent the completion of a natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany known as Nord Stream 2. ""I commend the administration for these actions, but I consider them less than a half step forward. What is missing is a robust effort to actually stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,"" Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement. ""The lack of Nord Stream 2 sanctions today makes it even more obvious the administration, for unknown reasons, is foot-dragging on this issue."" Republicans have argued that the Biden administration must impose sanctions on entities involved in the pipeline's construction under US law, but they have failed to do so. ""If the Biden Administration is serious about imposing real costs on the Putin regime's efforts to undermine U.S. democratic institutions and weaken our allies and partners, then it must ensure the Russian malign influence Nord Stream 2 pipeline project is never completed,"" House Foreign Affairs ranking Republican Michael McCaul of Texas said in a statement Thursday. In an interview last month with CNN's Dana Bash, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said he made clear to his German counterpart the US views the pipeline as a bad deal. ""It gives Russia more of a weapon using energy as a tool of coercion,"" he said. Foreign policy -- and Russia -- will keep Biden's attention Since taking office in January, Biden has focused on getting a massive Covid-19 relief package signed into law, and now is turning his attention to passing a major infrastructure package through Congress. But the sanctions are a reminder that foreign policy problems will always be looming and can snatch the focus of a presidency at a moment's notice. Blinken this week expressed concerns about Russia's military buildup along the border with Ukraine, in what's the largest massing of troops near Ukraine since 2014, when Russian forces invaded and occupied Crimea. Thursday's sanctions included punishing Russia for its ongoing occupation of Crimea, seven years later. The senior administration official said Biden intends to hold a summit with Putin in Europe over the coming months but noted the Kremlin had not responded the US invitation.",20,5.526094150843775,3.0294679626549263,2.496626188188849,14

""What was striking today was every single ally expressed the same concerns,"" said Blinken, speaking alongside US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Ukraine estimates that Russia has amassed as many as 50,000 troops in the region, while the current US assessment is that the Russian military has moved more than 40 battalion tactical groups into the border area, which could total up 40,000 troops. It is the largest buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine since 2014, when Russian forces invaded the country and occupied the Crimean Peninsula. ""It is a part of a broader pattern of Russian aggressive action, which raises very serious concerns,"" said Stoltenberg. ""Allies fully support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and we call on Russia to de-escalate immediately, stop its pattern of aggressive provocations and respect its international commitments."" On Tuesday, Gen. Tod Wolters, head of the US European Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee the latest intelligence showed that a ""very sizable"" Russian ground force as well as ""notable"" increased air and naval forces had moved into the Ukraine border region and Crimea. ""It is of the size and scale and scope that is of great concern, and it mirrors the size and scope and scale of the infiltration of forces that occurred back in 2014."" In addition, Russia has moved SA-22 air defense missile units into the region, according to a US official tracking Russian movements. That system is designed to protect Russian troops and critical military and civilian targets against air attack. ""We call upon Russia to cease their provocations and to be more transparent about this recent activity,"" said Austin, noting that the US has provided Ukraine with nonlethal materials, weapons and trainers, and that he expects that to continue. The stark warning about Russia's growing military presence near its southwestern neighbor comes a day after President Joe Biden spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden voiced US concerns about Russian forces, per a statement from the White House. Pentagon officials say the current intelligence does not indicate that this land force is prepared for offensive operations in the next few days, because there is no evidence of the logistics, spare parts, fuel and medical capability that would need to be pre-positioned. But the concern remains that there are also no indicators of Russia reducing its forces or signaling a de-escalation. And events on the ground can change quickly, officials caution, noting that the intelligence assessments typically project out for only a few days at a time. US reconnaissance aircraft are continuing to fly over the Black Sea to gather intelligence about Russian moves. The US assesses the Russians are likely to begin their own maritime war games in the area in the coming days. The US Navy filed initial diplomatic paperwork with Turkey for permission to send two warships into the Black Sea in the coming days but has decided not to send the ships into the sensitive region, according to a defense official with direct knowledge. The destroyers are being kept out of the Black Sea for now, as the move is seen as too escalatory, US officials say. Instead, the ships will remain in the nearby Aegean Sea area, ready to respond if needed. ""We will remain vigilant,"" one official says. Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergey Ryabkov, warned the United States on Tuesday that it is better for the US Navy to stay away from the Russian Federation and Crimea, stating that the risks of incidents are very high, according to state news agency RIA. The United States ""must understand that the risks of certain incidents are very high. We have already observed something similar in a completely different water area this year. We warn the United States that it is better for them to stay away from Crimea, from our Black Sea coast. For their own good,"" Ryabkov told reporters. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN's Matthew Chance that the US is a ""good friend"" of Ukraine, but that Biden ""must do more,"" to deter Russia and help bring this conflict to an end.",4,3.1424692801753054,2.361290746635455,0.7811785335398502,16
2021-04-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/politics/world-wide-threats-hearing-senate-intelligence-committee/index.html,"US intel chief says spy agencies still do not know 'where, when or how' Covid-19 was initially transmitted","US intelligence agencies still do not know ""exactly where, when or how Covid-19 virus was transmitted initially"" in China but remain focused on two primary theories, that ""it emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals or it was a laboratory accident,"" the nation's top spy told Senate lawmakers on Wednesday. That admission from Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines came during the worldwide threats hearing. Her testimony is consistent with an intelligence community statement from almost a year ago that said it has not determined ""whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan."" That statement also said definitively the virus ""was not man-made or genetically modified."" ""It is absolutely accurate the intelligence community does not know exactly where, when, or how Covid-19 virus was transmitted initially, and basically components have coalesced around two alternative theories, these scenarios are it emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals, or it was a laboratory accident,"" Haines told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. CIA Director William Burns, who also appeared alongside other intelligence agency leaders Wednesday, that he agreed with Haines' remarks and added that it is clear to analysts ""the Chinese leadership has not been fully forthcoming or fully transparent in working with the {World Health Organization} who were providing the kind of original complete data that would help answer those questions."" ""We're doing everything we can, using all the sources available to all of us on this panel to try to get to the bottom of it,"" he added. National Security Agency director and head of US Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone noted that US cyber agencies are aiding that effort and continue to gather and analyze information around the virus' origins. A source familiar with the intelligence told CNN late last month that the intelligence community is not currently leaning one way or the other regarding the two theories. ""We will probably never know the truth, because even the Chinese don't know the truth, and it will be difficult for US intelligence to figure it out if the Chinese never do,"" the source said. ""The Chinese have NO interest in learning the truth, so it's hard to spy on them and find out what the truth is."" The source also told CNN that there is increasingly strong evidence to suggest that the wet market was not the initial source of the outbreak. Another official from a country that is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing coalition concurred: the lab theory hasn't been entirely discounted because of lack of data and access from the Chinese. China 'an unparalleled priority' for intelligence community In her opening remarks during Wednesday's hearing, Haines told lawmakers that China poses ""an unparalleled priority for the intelligence community"" and is pushing to revise global norms in ways that favor Beijing using a variety of tactics. She warned specifically that China has ""substantial"" cyber capabilities that ""if deployed, at a minimum, can cause localized, temporary disruptions to critical infrastructure inside the United States."" During her brief opening remarks, Haines also warned that global disruptions like the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and technological change are likely to produce more competition internationally and instability across the globe. That reality ""compels"" the intelligence community must broaden its definition of national security, she said. ""At no point has it been more important to invest in our norms and institutions, our workforce, and the integration of our work,"" Haines said. Afghanistan withdrawal will 'diminish' CIA ability to collect intelligence The withdrawal of US and coalition troops from Afghanistan was raised by multiple lawmakers during Wednesday's hearing as President Joe Biden is set to formally announce Wednesday that American forces will leave the country before the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. If the United States withdraws from Afghanistan -- ""whenever that time comes"" -- the CIA's ability to collect intelligence and act on potential threats there will ""diminish,"" agency director Bill Burns told the Senate Intelligence Committee. Neither al Qaeda or ISIS currently have the ability to strike the US homeland, Burns said, but ""it is clear that our ability to keep that threat in Afghanistan in check from either al Qaeda or ISIS in Afghanistan has benefited greatly from the presence of US and coalition militaries on the ground and in the air, fueled by intelligence provided by the CIA and our other intelligence partners."" The CIA's operations in Afghanistan have long depended on the traditional military presence there and questions have swirled around what kind of intelligence and counterterrorism capabilities the United States might be able to retain in Afghanistan after September 11, as Biden has vowed to do. When the US does withdraw, Burns said the United States will ""retain a suite of [intelligence] capabilities,"" some of them preexisting and some that will have to be developed to help the United States keep tabs and disrupt any effort by either al Qaeda or ISIS to rebuild. ""All of that means that there's there is a significant risk once the US military and the coalition militaries withdraw, but we will work very hard at CIA and with all of our partners to try to provide the kind of strategic warning to others in the US government, that enables them and us to address that threat if it starts to materialize,"" Burns said. Russian military buildup a 'serious concern' The Russian military buildup along its border with Ukraine, as well as in Crimea, is a ""serious concern"" and could be a precursor to ""limited military incursions"" by Russia, Burns said Wednesday, echoing comments made by other top administration officials in recent days. The moves by the Russian military could be an intimidation tactic to Ukraine's leadership, as well as signaling to the United States, Burns said. ""That buildup has reached the point where, you know, it also could provide the basis for limited military incursions as well,"" Burns told the committee. That was part of Biden's conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Burns said, in which Biden proposed a summit with Putin in the coming months. Burns, a veteran diplomat who was ambassador to Moscow, joked that ""most of my white hair came from serving in Russia and dealing with Putin's Russia over the years.""",20,2.160633761719575,4.650054268353332,-2.489420506633757,5
2021-04-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/12/europe/ukraine-zelensky-front-lines/index.html,Ukraine's President heads to the trenches as Russia masses its troops,"Ankle-deep in thick black sludge, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky moves stealthily with his troops in single file through the warren of trenches and tunnels that form the tense front lines in the east of his country. It feels more like the early 20th century than a modern conflict, with tired, nervous soldiers gripping their rifles around him as they reach open ground, scanning the area for movement across no-mans-land. They know snipers, likely trained by Russians, say Ukrainian officials are looking for a chance to fire. More than 20 of their comrades have been gunned down already this year. It's eerily quiet with an occasional crack of a gunshot in the distance shattering the calm, keeping everybody on edge. This area near Mariupol is a risky place for the President of a country to visit, but that doesn't stop Zelensky who granted CNN unprecedented access to his trip to the front lines, where he insists on going to the most forward positions. ""If I visit a military base, the guys at the very front will hear about it and think I forgot about them,"" Zelensky told CNN in exclusive comments over two days. ""They need to know they have political support."" Zelensky, strapped into a camouflage flak jacket and helmet, has to sprint across the open ground with his presidential security to reach the trench cover. With Russian troops massing on their side of the border with Ukraine, the US and its NATO allies declared political and military backing for Ukraine. Zelensky urged them to bolster their support. New boiling point in long standoff For years, the brutal conflict in eastern Ukraine, between government forces and Russian-backed separatists, has been locked in a tense standoff. Major combat, which cost thousands of lives since 2014, has given way to a grinding stalemate. Following the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, fighting erupted in the neighboring Donbas region -- another mainly Russian speaking area of Ukraine with rebels demanding independence from Kiev. But amid growing tensions with the United States and its Western allies, Russian forces have again been spotted on the move across the border sparking concerns the war may be reignited. Cell phone video has emerged of Russian armored columns driving towards the Ukrainian frontier. Tanks and artillery guns have been seen being transported by rail. There's also been a build-up reported in Crimea. In Moscow, the Kremlin says the troop movements are inside Russia, part of a planned military exercise and pose no threat. But at the front lines, the Ukrainian President told CNN a Russian invasion is a very real possibility his country is bracing for. ""Of course. We know it, from 2014 we know it can be each day,"" he said. ""They are ready, but we are also ready because we are on our land and our territory,"" he told CNN. Lt. Gen. Ruslan Khomchak, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, told CNN an estimated 50,000 Russian troops have now gathered across the Russian border and in Crimea. In addition, there are at least 35,000 Russian-backed separatists in rebel-held areas of Ukraine, he said. Even before this current worrying build up in the number of troops at Moscow's command on Ukraine's doorstep, Zelensky called for the US to sell it weapons, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles. Those weapons have now been delivered, most notoriously in a phone conversation with then-President Donald Trump. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that there are ""real concerns"" over Russia's action. On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Blinken said, ""The question is, 'Is Russia going to continue to act aggressively and recklessly?' If it does, the [US] President's been clear, there'll be costs, there'll be consequences."" CNN reported Friday that the US is considering sending warships into the Black Sea in the next few weeks in a show of support for Ukraine. Lurching to the future From the air, above the muddy trenches, the seemingly endless flatness of eastern Ukraine is punctuated by battered towns and the rusting industrial hulks of the Soviet-era factories that made this war-ravaged region Ukraine's economic backbone. Military helicopters, deafening old MI-8s first developed during the Soviet era, painted in unnaturally vivid combat camouflage, fly fast and low over the countryside to avoid ground fire. Every few minutes they lurch upwards to leapfrog trees or electricity lines, then quickly plunge back down again within feet of the soil. On board the aging presidential chopper, which retains a degree of well-worn comfort, Zelensky shouts above the engine noise of how the US is a ""good friend"" of Ukraine, but that President Biden ""must do more,"" to deter Russia and help bring this conflict to an end. More weapons, more money to fight, and, crucially, more support to join NATO, the Western military alliance where an attack on one member commits all to respond, he explained. ""If they [the US] see Ukraine in NATO, they have to say it directly, and do it. Not words,"" Zelensky told CNN. But the chances of that are slim, amid concerns that moving Ukraine closer to NATO membership would provoke Moscow, possibly fueling a broader conflict. ""Maybe you are right,"" Zelensky responds. ""But what now is going on? What we do here? What do our people do here? They fight."" At the front line, Zelensky led a minute of silence for the fallen. With or without NATO, this is his country's reality. Ukraine is at war.",4,3.0543990421781695,2.2767271772438864,0.7776718649342831,6
2021-04-09,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/09/europe/russian-forces-ukraine-border-analysis-intl/index.html,"Russian forces are massing on Ukraine's border. Bluff or not, Putin is playing with fire","For an army given to masking its moves, surely the worst way to disguise a potential imminent invasion of a country is by overtly preparing for it. This is the paradox around Russia's visible buildup in its west, not far from the Ukrainian border. Were Moscow trying to reverse the military stalemate around the Donbas separatist region -- that it truncated from Ukraine in 2014 -- would it want to telegraph its moves so blatantly? Russia's signals are obvious. Relentless social media videos show armored convoys moving towards the general border area. These led to open-source intelligence sleuths @CITeam_en spotting a congregation of likely hundreds of vehicles not far from the Russian city of Voronezh. That is still over 100 miles from Ukraine, but it is a sizeable buildup that was captured on satellite images from the Maxar technology group. The White House said this week that Russia now has more troops near the Ukraine border than any time since 2014 -- when the peninsula of Crimea was annexed. Further south, military intelligence reports have assessed that some 4,000 heavily armed Russian forces had been seen moving in Crimea, a US defense official told CNN. Moscow is also talking the game. Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu has announced snap readiness inspections for the army. The Kremlin's envoy to the conflict, deputy head of the presidential administration Dmitri Kozak, said that Moscow would, as has pretty much always been implied, come to the defense of Ukraine's eastern population if needed. And he said the start of a conflict would be the ""beginning of the end of Ukraine."" Russia's declarations are pretty noisy. For Ukraine's part, President Volodymyr Zelensky has moved some units closer to the Donbas, and took a very high-profile trip to the area Thursday. Like Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Zelensky's domestic ratings are not that healthy. He talked the language of peace. He tried to be close to the troops, aware that US President Joe Biden has said he will stand by him. The White House has said it is ""increasingly concerned by recent escalating Russian aggressions in eastern Ukraine"" and US officials have also hinted they might send warships to the Black Sea, a signal of increased involvement, even though American aircraft have regularly been monitoring that area. German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked Putin to pull his forces back during a call on Thursday. Everyone is getting very excitable, very fast. Speculation about what comes next in the biggest land war in Europe in two decades is as rife as the Kremlin surely hope it would be. Meanwhile, its sole cost so far is the fuel bill of moving a lot of tanks around. The key as-yet-unanswered question is what Russia's objective would be in a military intervention. Some analysts have speculated it might flood the separatist areas and adjacent conflict zones with a huge Russian ""peacekeeping"" force, designed to impose its will and rules on the area -- effectively annexing the Donbas in earnest. Yet this would almost guarantee a Western response, likely at first in the form of sanctions. It would also achieve for Moscow essentially the same control it has now on these areas, albeit with lot of expensive Russian skin and hardware in the game. It is all the squeeze, with none of the juice, and so probably not that favorable to the Kremlin. The second option floated by analysts involves the creation of a land corridor between separatist Donbas in the east and Crimea, the annexed peninsula to the south of Ukraine. For years, water has been a scarce resource in Crimea, a crisis which a senior Ukrainian official warned me two years ago could reach a critical stage in the summer of 2019. It still persists, along with the broader challenge for Moscow of maintaining a passable standard of life in Crimea through sea supplies, and over a small, new bridge it has made across the Kerch Strait. It is not a sustainable state of affairs for Russia's latest acquisition in the long term. But a land corridor -- a strip running through the Ukrainian town of Mariupol and to the Armiansk area above Crimea -- would also be extremely vulnerable for any occupying Russian forces. They would be caught between the Azov Sea and a very angry, better-equipped-than-before, Ukrainian army. To hold that corridor effectively, they would have to push deeper into Ukraine, and then face yet more resistance from the Ukrainian army and the local population. Long gone is the hope from 2014 that Russian soldiers would be seen as ""liberators"" from a corrupt Kiev government. Hostility is much more palpable. So the task ahead of the Russian army is either do so little that the inevitable Western sanctions seem imposed for minimal gain. Or do so much (way too much) that you have to occupy large swathes of Ukraine for years. It's a mess both ways. In Moscow's eyes then, a perhaps much better option is to amass its forces, make loud noises about Ukraine's desire for war, hint at diplomacy and use its heavy-metal-gloved-hand across the border to force a better, negotiated solution. This of course presumes the Kremlin head is always making the best decisions. Putin is also capable of overreach or folly. A third invasion of Ukraine in 2021 is also a much more dangerous gamble for Putin than the one he took in 2014-15. US President Biden has made it clear he'll offer ""unwavering support"" to Kiev. Washington's mindset is irrevocably hardened to the idea that Russia is a threat. And Ukrainian leader Zelensky, as politically and militarily inexperienced as he is, will doubtless benefit domestically from being dragged into a conflict he hasn't started. Yet two enduring, unquantifiable risks remain. The first is that Putin may see, among all the chaos of the next few weeks, a moment of opportunity to strike, and simply decide to deal with the consequences later. The second is the inevitable peril of amassing angry forces on both sides of an already active front line. An unanticipated error or surge by either party could spiral into a bigger war. If Moscow hopes its buildup means its phones start ringing more frequently, and diplomacy takes over, then it would better happen soon.",4,1.9440423086251628,2.8728887676483295,-0.9288464590231666,6
2021-04-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/politics/ukraine-us-black-sea/index.html,US considering sending warships to Black Sea amid Russia-Ukraine tensions,"The United States is considering sending warships into the Black Sea in the next few weeks in a show of support for Ukraine amid Russia's increased military presence on Ukraine's eastern border, a US defense official told CNN Thursday. The US Navy routinely operates in the Black Sea, but a deployment of warships now would send a specific message to Moscow that the US is closely watching, the official said. The US is required to give 14 days notice of its intention to enter the Black Sea under a 1936 treaty giving Turkey control of the straits to enter the sea. It is unclear if a notice has yet been sent. The Defense official also said the Navy is continuing to fly reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Black Sea to monitor Russian naval activity and any troops movements in Crimea. On Wednesday, two US B-1 bombers conducted missions over the Aegean Sea. Although the US does not see the amassing of Russian forces as posturing for an offensive action, the official told CNN that ""if something changes we will be ready to respond."" Their current assessment is that the Russians are conducting training and exercises and intelligence has not indicated military orders for further action, the official said, but noted that they are well-aware that could change at any time. The Biden administration and the international community have expressed concerns about mounting tensions between Ukraine and Russia. In recent weeks, President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley and national security adviser Jake Sullivan have all spoken to their Ukrainian counterparts. On Thursday White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Russia's actions are ""deeply concerning."" ""The United States is increasingly concerned by recently escalating Russian aggressions in eastern Ukraine, including Russia's movements on Ukraine's border. Russia now has more troops on the border of Ukraine than any time since 2014. Five Ukrainian soldiers have been killed this week alone. These are all deeply concerning signs,"" Psaki said. She also said a review of the Russian government's actions will be concluded in ""weeks, not months,"" and that new sanctions on Moscow would not be introduced this week. The Pentagon and State Department have also expressed their concern about Russia's behavior in eastern Ukraine. ""We are concerned by recent escalating Russian aggressions in eastern Ukraine, including the credible reports that have been emanating about Russian troop movements on Ukraine's borders and occupied Crimea,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said this week. ""We have asked Russia for an explanation of these provocations, but most importantly what we have signaled directly with our Ukrainian partners is a message of reassurance,"" he said. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said this week that it was important ""for all sides to comply with the Minsk Agreement"" and ""for the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of Ukraine to be respected by Russia."" On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw troops in order to de-escalate the situation, according to a spokesperson for the German government. According to a Kremlin readout of the call, Putin accused Kyiv of ""provocative actions.""",4,1.871653103514282,3.8843019044844898,-2.012648800970208,20

""Russia's destabilizing actions undermine the de-escalation intentions that had been achieved through [last year's agreement],"" chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday. ""Additionally, we are aware of Ukrainian military reports concerning Russian troop movements on Ukraine's borders."" Secretary of State Tony Blinken reaffirmed the ""unwavering support"" of the United States for Ukraine's territorial integrity in the face of ""Russia's ongoing aggression in the Donbas and Crimea,"" according to a readout of his call with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba Wednesday. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley also spoke to the top Ukrainian general Wednesday, while national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart at the beginning of the week. The Pentagon had grown increasingly concerned after military intelligence reports assessed that some 4,000 heavily armed Russian forces had been observed moving in Crimea, according to a US defense official. ""It was not totally clear what they were up to,"" the official said, adding that the US now believes on further assessment it may have been part of a Russian military exercise. Part of that assessment was based on calls with Ukrainian officials who also viewed the Russian activity as an exercise. If so, the movement of so many Russian military personnel was a large exercise and may be a deliberate message from the Kremlin to the Biden administration about Russia's strength in the region and its ability to challenge US allies, the official said. This comes as NATO countries on Monday scrambled jets 10 times to track an unusually high level of Russian military flights over a large area of Europe including the North Sea, the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. NATO jets wound up conducting six intercepts in a six-hour period. The Biden administration is taking a tougher approach to Russia, and Ukraine is only the latest source of tension between the two adversaries. The White House unveiled a raft of sanctions against Russian officials and entities at the beginning of the month over the poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. President Joe Biden then warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin would ""pay a price"" for his efforts to undermine the 2020 US elections and went on to call Putin a ""killer."" Meanwhile, the administration is expected to impose more sanctions on Russia over election interference and the SolarWinds cyberattack. On Wednesday, Milley spoke with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov. While the topics the two generals discussed have not been made public, behind the scenes the Defense Department has been concerned for the last several days about the build-up of Russian troops and equipment along the Ukraine border. The Defense Department recently raised the so-called ""watch condition level"" on that region to gather updated intelligence assessments on Russian activity and intentions, while monitoring any potential threats. The New York Times was first to report that development. Russia blamed Ukraine for renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week that Russia was concerned about ""Ukraine's provocations,"" but he said he hoped it would not escalate to fighting. But Ukraine warned of a series of Russian violations of the ceasefire, including two incidents of mortar fire and large-caliber machine gun fire that led to the death of the four Ukrainian soldiers last Friday. On Tuesday, Ukraine accused Russia of violating the ceasefire seven times, prompting the country's parliament to call for an increase in political and economic pressure on Moscow.",4,1.548681934591226,5.341096495513455,-3.7924145609222286,7
2021-03-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/17/politics/trump-russia-elections/index.html,"New US intel report shows Russia, Trump and GOP acolytes have same goals","A new US intelligence report that finds Russia interfered in the 2020 election to help Donald Trump and hurt Joe Biden also underscores a fundamental truth: The gravest threat to US democracy comes from within. The report, released by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, finds that Moscow sought to inject misleading information about Biden into the campaign through officials and others close to Trump. The real bombshell it contains is not the confidence of the spy agencies that Russia hoped to subvert American democracy. It is that US intelligence experts effectively confirmed that for the second election in a row, Trump acolytes repeatedly used, knowingly or otherwise, misinformation produced by the spies of one of America's most sworn foreign adversaries to try to win a US election. And given the advantage of hindsight, the latest intelligence assessment is not just an isolated example of incriminating evidence against Russia and its efforts to create chaos and discord within the United States. For all of the stale US debate about whether Trump and his aides ""colluded"" with Russia, there are now multiple reports, intelligence assessments and other known details to expose a damning reality: Moscow with its election meddling, Trump acolytes pushing false claims of voter fraud and his GOP supporters in the states now passing voter suppression laws share the same goal -- the denigration of the US democratic system. The readiness of the former President's men to use Russian misinformation in 2020 -- while denying collusion in 2016 -- was but one prong of the assault on the integrity of US elections. After all, it came as Trump was challenging democratic customs that form the bedrock of American freedoms. He spent months seeking to discredit the fairness of the vote -- the sacred core of US democracy -- to hedge against his eventual loss. He later denied his fair-and-square defeat, incited the deadly US Capitol insurrection -- which sought to disrupt Biden's transition to power -- and is using his sway over his party to force future Republican candidates to sign up to his big lie of widespread voter fraud. Thus, the candidate who Moscow helped to win the 2016 election had four years later become the primary destructive force aimed at US democracy. It ought to be concerning that the sentiments of many Republicans who falsely decry the fairness of the current US electoral system appear to coincide with those of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ultimately, the most alarming implication of the release of Tuesday's report is that it may not be necessary for Russia to interfere in the 2024 presidential election in the same way as in 2016 and 2020. From Trump's lies about a stolen second term to claims by some Republican governors that making it harder to vote makes an election more democratic, some Americans are already doing far more themselves to damage the US system than Moscow can. Trump's China claims discredited The report finds that Iran also tried to interfere in the election but that no foreign power -- not even Russia -- sought to change vote totals or attack electoral infrastructure. US intelligence agencies also assessed that China considered trying to influence the result but did not do so, largely undercutting false claims to the contrary by Trump, which his administration knew to be untrue but still made in the days before Biden's victory. While the attempts to sway the opinions of American voters are serious -- and will likely draw US sanctions, according to White House officials -- they ultimately did not succeed. Biden prevailed in the election and Moscow did not go as far as it had to damage the previous Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, four years earlier with its hacking scheme. But the report comes with troubling new assessments of how Moscow was yet again able to use those around Trump -- often in plain sight -- in an effort to discredit an American election and to try to influence the result. It finds, for instance, that Putin had ""purview"" over the activities of Andrii Derkach, a Ukrainian legislator who the US says is an active Russian agent. Derkach collaborated with Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani to spread disinformation during Trump's first impeachment. That drama was caused by the ex-President's own effort to coax Kiev into probing Biden over false allegations perpetrated by people close to Moscow. The DNI report didn't mention Giuliani by name. But it said: ""A key element of Moscow's strategy this election cycle was its use of people linked to Russian intelligence to launder influence narratives -- including misleading or unsubstantiated allegations against President Biden -- through US media organizations, US officials and prominent US individuals, some of whom were close to former President Trump and his administration."" Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, said Tuesday that the report did not leave a lot to the imagination. ""It doesn't take a lot of sophisticated analysis to figure out who some of those individuals -- hopefully again unknowingly -- (are who were) manipulated by the Russians,"" Warner said on Capitol Hill. In some ways, the information released parallels the finding of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, which showed that those around Trump used information conjured up by the Russians in 2016 -- including emails stolen from Democratic servers that damaged Clinton. Mueller wrote that although he could not prove Trump aides ""conspired or coordinated"" with Russia, the campaign ""expected that it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts."" There is another pattern here. Either gullible aides around Trump were oblivious to being manipulated by foreign operatives -- or they were not being willing to probe where the misinformation came from. And those alternatives put the best possible spin on their behavior. Russian misinformation The new report also found that Russia's primary effort in 2020 formed around a narrative that Biden and his family had corrupt ties to Ukraine. There has been no evidence of criminal activity by the current President nor by his son Hunter, who worked on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. But, incredibly, this Russia misinformation ended up being the centerpiece of Trump's campaign against Biden in the closing days of the election. The report does not say so, but this material was used by Trump personally in many campaign appearances -- an extraordinary marker of success for an intelligence operation hatched by a foreign power. The report also makes clear that Derkach and another Russian influence agent, Konstantin Kilimnik, used willing conservative media networks in the United States to launder their deceptions and false information about Biden. Putin, a former KGB agent who regarded the end of the Soviet Union as one of history's worst disasters, has long sought to damage the West by exploiting its own political and societal divides. The January 2017 US intelligence assessment into meddling in the prior election found, for example, that the Russians wanted to ""undermine the US-led international liberal order."" And Mueller said Putin was motivated by a desire to ""provoke and amplify political discord in the United States."" The nature of such disinformation campaigns -- which unfold in the smoke and mirrors world where espionage, fake news and misinformation meet -- is that they continue to deliver for months and years afterward for a very modest investment. For example, Trump's inevitable protests that he is yet again being targeted by a new ""Russia hoax"" will further poison the reputation of US intelligence agencies -- the sworn rivals of Russia's spy services -- among the ex-President's supporters. Trump's propaganda may also serve to further foment distrust among his supporters with the US political system itself -- a feeling being exploited by GOP state lawmakers all over the United States to justify voter suppression laws supposedly designed to restore ""integrity"" to US elections. From Georgia to Arizona and Texas to Iowa, Trump's allies are attempting to shorten early voting hours, limit Sunday polling -- used disproportionately by Black voters -- and roll back mail-in voting, which made it easier for more Americans to vote in 2020 in a record popular-vote turnout.",20,5.978909256704862,0.7666263785980697,5.212282878106792,19
2021-03-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/17/politics/us-intel-report-trump-china-election-interference-claims/index.html,Intelligence report contradicts claims by Trump and his team on China election interference,"The US intelligence report released Tuesday detailing foreign election interference in the 2020 election contradicts repeated statements from former President Donald Trump and senior members of his administration that China -- and not Russia -- was the top foreign threat to the integrity of the election. The report also raises questions about the effort from Senate Republicans to investigate the Bidens and Ukraine, a probe that examined many of the same allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine that the Russian-linked officials were pushing, according to the intelligence community report. The report, compiled by the US intelligence community and declassified and released by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines on Tuesday, assessed that the Russian government meddled in the 2020 election with an influence campaign ""denigrating"" President Joe Biden and ""supporting"" Trump. In addition, the report said China did not interfere and ""considered but did not deploy influence efforts intended to change the outcome of the US Presidential election."" That assessment flies in the face of the public comments from Trump and members of his administration, including former Attorney General William Barr and former national security adviser Robert O'Brien who helped push Trump's narrative that China was interfering in the election more aggressively than Russia or Iran. CNN previously reported that Trump decried any suggestion that Russia posed an equally dangerous threat as China as equivalent to the partisan ""witch hunt"" against him -- a view that was factored into the messaging of administration officials, who focused their public comments on Beijing and downplayed Moscow's actions. A whistleblower also previously accused top Trump political appointees in the Department of Homeland Security of instructing career officials to ""cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the US and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran,"" according to the documents obtained by CNN. That order came from O'Brien, according to the complaint. The new report rebuts many of the claims Trump and his allies made surrounding foreign interference and the election, where Trump and administration officials repeatedly downplayed the threat of Russian election interference while Trump's allies such as Rudy Giuliani worked with Russian-linked Ukrainians to try to dig up dirt on Biden. While the intelligence report didn't mention Giuliani by name, it includes a detailed accounting of how Russian-linked officials sought to damage Biden's campaign by providing materials to US officials in an attempt to implicate the Bidens ""in allegedly corrupt activities related to Ukraine."" ""The primary effort the IC (intelligence community) uncovered revolved around a narrative -- that Russian actors began spreading as early as 2014 -- alleging corrupt ties between President Biden, his family, and other US officials and Ukraine,"" the report says. Those same Russian-linked allegations involving the Bidens and Ukraine were taken up in a Senate GOP investigation led by then-Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson. As part of his probe, Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, sought to subpoena and cited a Ukrainian official, Andrii Telizhenko, whom the Treasury Department says was connected to Andriy Derkach, one of the key officials the intelligence community assessed was part of Russia's election interference efforts. Johnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, released their report two months before the election criticizing Hunter Biden's financial dealings in Ukraine and other countries, like China. At the time, Democrats accused Johnson of receiving information that was part of a Russian disinformation campaign, which Johnson and Grassley repeatedly denied. 'I believe it's China' For top Trump administration officials, foreign election interference was all about China. Asked in September which country had been most assertive in interfering in the election, Barr told CNN's Wolf Blitzer: ""I believe it's China."" During the same interview, Barr also went out of his way to dilute the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was again actively interfering in a US election. ""I accept that there is some preliminary activity that suggests that they might try again,"" he said of Russia. ""It wouldn't surprise me if Russia tries something again of the same general genre before."" It's not clear what US intelligence had assessed about China's potential election interference at the time of Barr's interview with CNN in September. Asked this week about his previous comments and the new report, Barr said his response in the CNN interview related to the broader national security threat from China, which the previous and current administrations agree is the most serious. ""China has much more formidable capabilities. I was looking at things broadly,"" Barr said. Days after Barr's interview last year, O'Brien said that he agreed ""100%"" with Barr's assertion that China was being more aggressive with its attempts to influence the 2020 election than other malign actors, including Russia, but offered little evidence to back up the claim. ""What the intelligence community has made very clear,"" O'Brien told reporters at the time, ""first you have China, which has the most massive program to influence the United States politically, you have Iran and you have Russia. These are all three adversary countries that are seeking to disrupt our elections."" ""Some of them prefer Biden; some people say some of them prefer the President,"" he had said, notably sounding certain that some had been pushing for Biden but casting some level of doubt on whether some were pushing for Trump. Those comments last year by O'Brien and Barr underscore how Trump and his allies often blurred the line between broader national security concerns -- that China was engaged in a long-term strategy to shape US policy -- and allegations that China was actively meddling in the election, a distinction that is reaffirmed in the report released Tuesday. While the report also notes a ""minority view"" that some intelligence officials have ""moderate"" confidence that China took ""at least some steps"" to hurt Trump's candidacy, it does not offer any evidence to support what the former President and some of his allies were claiming prior to the election. Intel officials says China is a threat but report says it did not interfere in the election Intelligence officials have long warned that China poses a grave national security threat and is engaged in a highly sophisticated malign foreign influence campaign against the US, but the report released Tuesday highlights a key distinction between the broader threat posed by Beijing and claims of targeted election interference. Trump's former intelligence chief, John Ratcliffe, repeatedly conflated the two issues when asked about Beijing's election interference activity, pushing claims that aligned more closely with comments made by Barr and O'Brien than assessments from election security officials. ""I can't get into a whole lot of details, other than to say that China is using a massive and sophisticated influence campaign that dwarfs anything that any other country is doing,"" Ratcliffe claimed during an August interview with Fox News. Prior to leaving his post, Ratcliffe said he supported the ""minority view"" on China that was cited in Tuesday's report, according to a letter that was attached to the classified version sent to Congress and obtained by CNN. ""Similar actions by Russia and China are assessed and communicated to policymakers differently, potentially leading to the false impression that Russia sought to influence the election but China did not,"" he wrote, citing a report by the intelligence community Ombudsman which found that analysts were inconsistent in how they defined the terms ""influence"" and ""interference"" when referring to China and Russia. Republicans were also raising concerns about China's influence efforts targeting Americans prior to the election, but several sources familiar with briefings provided to lawmakers told CNN at the time that intelligence officials had not presented clear evidence showing Beijing is actively interfering in the election or taking specific steps to boost one candidate over the other. Instead, intelligence and election security officials focused, both privately and publicly, on the holistic threat posed by China, emphasizing that Beijing employs a variety of ""malign tactics"" that could have implications on the 2020 race. And while the intelligence community initially assessed that China preferred Trump to lose in November, a finding that Trump often used to justify his politically driven narrative, it ultimately concluded that Beijing did not favor one candidate over the other, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence report released Tuesday. ""China sought stability in its relationship with the United States and did not view either election outcome as advantageous enough for China to risk blowback if caught,"" it says. ""We assess that Beijing also believes there is a bipartisan consensus against China in the United States that leaves no prospect for a pro-China administration regardless of the election outcome."" Russian-linked Ukrainians pushed misinformation to Trump allies Tuesday's report assesses that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed Russia's interference campaign. It cites both Konstantin Kilimnik and Andriy Derkach as two Ukrainian-linked officials who were part of the Russian interference efforts. The US intelligence report says that Putin ""had purview over the activities"" of Derkach. ""Derkach, Kilimnik, and their associates sought to use prominent US persons and media conduits to launder their narratives to US officials and audiences. These Russian proxies met with and provided materials to Trump administration-linked US persons to advocate for formal investigations; hired a US firm to petition US officials; and attempted to make contact with several senior US officials,"" the report says. The report doesn't name Giuliani, but it references his efforts to dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine, according to a source familiar with the report. Giuliani's efforts included work with Derkach and another official, Telizhenko, who played a role in the Senate GOP investigation into the Bidens. The September report released by Johnson and Grassley detailing the findings of their Biden probe was critical of Hunter Biden's financial dealings and his work on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm, though it did not accuse Joe Biden of wrongdoing. As part of that investigation, Johnson sought to subpoena Telizhenko to obtain records about his work with a public affairs firm that contracted with Burisma, the Ukrainian e",20,2.735986680876705,0.6521572480500658,2.083829432826639,14
2021-03-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/16/politics/us-election-intel-report/index.html,US intelligence report says Russia used Trump allies to influence 2020 election with goal of 'denigrating' Biden,"The US intelligence community said in a landmark report Tuesday that the Russian government meddled in the 2020 election with an influence campaign ""denigrating"" President Joe Biden and ""supporting"" former President Donald Trump, detailing a massive disinformation push that successfully targeted, and was openly embraced, by Trump's allies. Russia's objectives were not limited to hurting Biden's candidacy and aiding Trump's reelection bid, the report says, as US intelligence found that Moscow also sought to undermine ""public confidence in the electoral process and exacerbate sociopolitical divisions in the US."" Overall, the report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence provides the most comprehensive assessment of foreign threats to the 2020 elections to date, detailing extensive influence operations by US adversaries, including Russia and Iran, that sought to undermine confidence in the democratic process, in addition to targeting specific presidential candidates. It also confirms what was largely assumed, and barely hidden, last year: Trump and his closest allies publicly embraced Russia's disinformation campaign against Biden, met with Kremlin-linked figures who were part of the effort, and promoted their conspiracy theories. The report said the most aggressive foreign attempt to ""undercut"" Trump came from Iran, but Iran didn't ""actively"" promote Biden, and their efforts were smaller than the Russian operation. But while the report concludes that multiple foreign adversaries did attempt to interfere, it also notes there are ""no indications that any foreign actor attempted to alter any technical aspect of the voting process in the 2020 US elections, including voter registration, casting ballots, vote tabulation, or reporting results."" That echoes what the Department of Homeland Security's cyber arm said the day after the 2020 presidential election. ""We have no evidence any foreign adversary was capable of preventing Americans from voting or changing vote tallies,"" CISA said at the time. The Biden administration is expected to announce sanctions related to election interference as soon as next week, three US State Department officials told CNN. The officials did not disclose any details related to the expected sanctions but said that they will target multiple countries including Russia, China and Iran. Russia used people close to Trump to spread disinformation Russia's efforts to influence the 2020 elections feature prominently in the report, which details how ""proxies linked to Russian intelligence"" were used to push unsubstantiated claims about Biden to into the American mainstream. ""A key element of Moscow's strategy this election cycle was its use of proxies linked to Russian intelligence to push influence narratives -- including misleading or unsubstantiated allegations against President Biden -- to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration,"" the report says. ""Unlike in 2016, we did not see persistent Russian cyber efforts to gain access to election infrastructure,"" it notes. The report concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""aware of and probably directed"" the operation to hurt Biden -- and give Trump a boost, much like he did in the 2016 election. For example, the US intelligence agencies assessed that Putin ""had purview over the activities of Andriy Derkach,"" the Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and repeatedly promoted anti-Biden disinformation. By tying Putin directly to Derkach's actions, the report only puts one degree of separation between the Russian leader and Trump's lawyer. These types of Trump-Russia connections were what led to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential collusion in the 2016 election. But this time, the relationship was out in the open. CNN has previously reported that Giuliani and other allies of the former President publicly aligned with Kremlin-linked figures like Derkach and others, even as the US government warned that they were spreading lies. Giuliani did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Tuesday. The report was a wholesale repudiation of many false narratives that were pushed by right-wing news outlets, including claims about Biden's dealings in Ukraine and widespread voter fraud. The report said Russia tried to ""launder influence narratives ... through US media organizations,"" but didn't name the specific outlets that were involved. However, the findings also unintentionally highlight the limits of the US government's ability to combat foreign meddling. Konstantin Kilimnik, described in the report as a Russian influence agent, and a Russian troll farm also mentioned in the findings, are accused of being repeat offenders -- meddling in 2016, and again in 2020. Kilimnik was indicted in 2018, but remained safely in Russia. A dozen people from the troll farm were changed and sanctioned, but the online operations continued. Still, Democrats were quick to highlight that the US intelligence community's findings underscore the warnings coming from lawmakers in the months leading up to the November election. ""The Intelligence Community Assessment released today underscores what we all knew already -- that Russia interfered to support former President Trump, hurt President Biden, and undermine confidence in our electoral process. Through proxies, Russia ran a successful intelligence operation that penetrated the former president's inner circle,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Tuesday. Sen. Mark Warner, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also pointed out that Russia has ""expended real effort"" interfering in both the 2020 and 2016 elections. ""This report highlights the ongoing and persistent efforts by our adversaries to influence our elections, which all Americans should be informed about. Russia, in particular, has expended real effort, not just in 2020, but also as we all recall in 2016, to influence election results."" Iran's covert influence campaign The report also describes how Iran carried out a ""multi-pronged covert influence campaign"" targeting the elections. Specifically, the report says that Iran's efforts were ""intended to undercut former President Trump's reelection prospects -- though without directly promoting his rivals -- undermine public confidence in the electoral process and US institutions, and sow division and exacerbate societal tensions in the US."" China is also mentioned, but in a very different context than Russia and Iran. ""We assess that China did not deploy interference efforts and considered but did not deploy influence efforts intended to change the outcome of the US Presidential election,"" the report states. That finding appears to undercut claims by the Trump administration that Beijing was interfering in the election to help Biden win, a message top officials pushed for months ahead of November prompting backlash from Democrats who accused them of attempting to equivocate the threat posed by China and Russia. The report does, however, note there were some conflicting opinions within the intelligence community about China's efforts, citing a ""minority view"" that some intelligence officials have ""moderate"" confidence that China took ""at least some steps"" to hurt Trump's candidacy. In a statement Tuesday, Biden's Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines called foreign malign influence an ""enduring challenge facing our country."" ""These efforts by U.S. adversaries seek to exacerbate divisions and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions. Addressing this ongoing challenge requires a whole-of-government approach grounded in an accurate understanding of the problem, which the Intelligence Community, through assessments such as this one, endeavors to provide,"" she said.

2021-01-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/19/politics/avril-haines-hearing-senate-intelligence/index.html,"Avril Haines, Biden's DNI pick, pledges to keep politics out of intelligence after Trump's wars with intelligence community","Avril Haines, President-elect Joe Biden's nominee to be director of national intelligence, pledged Tuesday to turn the corner after President Donald Trump's warring with the intelligence community. ""To be effective, the DNI must never shy away from speaking truth to power — even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult,"" Haines said at her confirmation hearing. ""To safeguard the integrity of our intelligence community, the DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics ever."" LIVE UPDATES: Biden prepares for inauguration on Trump's last full day in office The intelligence community Haines would lead upon her Senate confirmation has been frequently under assault from a President who has accused a so-called ""deep state"" of undermining his presidency, particularly when it came to Russia and his impeachment. Trump has fired officials in the intelligence community, and he placed a loyalist in the top intelligence post, former GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas, who clashed with career officials declassifying documents related to the FBI's Russia investigation and the extent that Russia and China sought to interfere in the 2020 election. Haines told senators Tuesday that Biden ""has made it absolutely clear that he expects the intelligence community to present him with an apolitical, truth-to-power analysis."" ""He will want to know what information we have that actually conflicts with his policy positions,"" Haines added. A former deputy CIA director and deputy national security adviser under President Barack Obama, Haines would be the first woman to lead the intelligence community in a role that was created following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Haines was introduced by Dan Coats, Trump's first director of national intelligence and a former GOP senator, who repeatedly clashed with Trump over Russia's interference in the 2016 election. ""Most important to me as former director of national intelligence,"" Coats said of Haines' qualifications, ""is her commitment to bringing non-politicized truth to power and restoring trust and confidence in the intelligence community and the American public."" Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who will become chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee once Democrats take control of the chamber, said that Haines' job will be to ensure the intelligence community ""recovers"" from the Trump era. ""The dedicated men and women of the Intelligence Community have been through a lot over the last four years,"" Warner said in his opening statement. ""Our intelligence professionals have been unfairly maligned. Their expertise, knowledge and analysis has often been ignored or even sometimes ridiculed by a president who seems oftentimes uninterested in facts. Those who bravely spoke the truth were vilified, reassigned, fired or retaliated against."" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the outgoing acting Republican chairman of the Intelligence panel, did not mention Trump's fights with the intelligence community in his opening statement, but said that it was important to fill the key national security role as quickly as possible. Among his first questions was asking Haines to commit to testifying publicly at the committee's worldwide threats hearing, which Ratcliffe balked at doing last year. Republicans questioned Haines on her views about China and Iran, including the Obama administration's Iran nuclear deal that Trump pulled back from. Haines said that while the incoming Biden administration has indicated that it would come back to the table with Iran if Tehran came back into compliance, she noted that ""frankly, we're a long ways from that."" Haines called China ""a challenge to our security, to our prosperity, to our values across a range of issues,"" noting that the intelligence community's approach to China ""has to evolve."" ""I do support an aggressive stance, in a sense, to deal with the challenge that we're facing,"" Haines said, adding that the US needed a stance that's ""more assertive than where we had been in the Obama-Biden administration."" In addition to pledging to restore trust both inside and outside the intelligence community, Haines noted the many challenges US intelligence agencies face, from China to the global Covid-19 pandemic to cybersecurity threats like the recent SolarWinds hack. In the wake of the insurrectionists ransacking the Capitol earlier this month, Haines was asked several questions about how the intelligence community can help the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to address the threat of white supremacist and far-right conspiracy groups. Haines told Sen. Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico, she would work with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to produce a public assessment of the threat posed by QAnon, the far-right conspiracy group. ""The intelligence community is not in the lead in managing these events, it's the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, but the intelligence community I hope will have an important role in supporting their work and ultimately, in particular, looking at any connections there are between folks in the United States and externally in foreign connections or influence that might've been appropriately identified as a context of the intelligence community."" Haines committed to Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, to release an unclassified report on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the Trump administration refused to do despite Congress passing a law requiring its publication. ""Yes, senator, absolutely will follow the law,"" Haines said. And Haines also pledged to provide Congress with intelligence community whistleblower complaints, in a nod to the Trump administration's withholding of the 2019 Ukraine complaint that ultimately led to Trump's first impeachment. Haines is likely to be among the first Biden Cabinet officials to be confirmed by the Senate, and there's expected to be little, if any, opposition to her nomination. The Intelligence Committee had initially sought to schedule her confirmation hearing last Friday in order to expedite the process, but a senator objected to holding the hearing virtually, leading to Tuesday's in-person session.

2020-11-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/trump-russia-investigation-declassification-battle/index.html,Trump allies clash with top intelligence officials in quest to declassify more Russia documents,"As President Donald Trump and his allies continue to publicly dispute the outcome of the election, they are also quietly seeking to discredit the Russia investigation that has cast a dark cloud over the administration for more than four years. Before Election Day, senior career intelligence officials and congressional Democrats braced for Trump's handpicked director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, to release highly classified documents related to the FBI's Russia probe, which they feared would expose critical sources and methods. Those concerns roared back this week in the wake of a flurry of personnel changes at the National Security Agency -- and the Pentagon -- as Trump installed political loyalists in key positions where they could help turn the tide in the behind-the-scenes battle over declassifying documents, which has raged for weeks. Trump believes the documents in question will undermine the intelligence community's unanimous finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 race to help him win, by exposing so-called ""deep state"" plots against his campaign and transition during the Obama administration, according to multiple current and former officials. But CIA and National Security Agency career officials have strenuously objected to releasing certain information from the Russia interference assessment, arguing that it would seriously damage sources and methods in a way that the intelligence community doesn't believe can be easily repaired. Both agencies have also cited concerns about cherry-picking information to release and the politicization of their work as they fight against Ratcliffe's recent efforts to satisfy Trump's promises to declassify thousands of pages of documents. Multiple sources familiar with the classified materials have downplayed the significance of these documents, telling CNN the administration won't make political hay by releasing them despite the President's fixation. While Ratcliffe and former acting DNI Richard Grenell have sought to declassify documents related to the Russia probe and Hillary Clinton's emails, CIA Director Gina Haspel and National Security Agency chief Gen. Paul Nakasone have fought those moves. Several batches of documents have been declassified, including the release of unverified Russian intelligence from 2016 that suggested Clinton's presidential campaign was trying to tie Trump to Russia. Trump and his allies have seized on the documents to attack the Obama administration -- and President-elect Joe Biden -- during the 2020 campaign. The National Security Agency and the CIA have repeatedly opposed Ratcliffe's declassification of the unverified intelligence. Behind the scenes, Haspel has defended the work of career officials who have come under criticism from Trump and allies over 2016-era intelligence work behind the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Haspel's job in jeopardy while Trump elevates loyalists The standoff has led the President to become increasingly frustrated with Haspel, in particular, who he blames for delaying the release of these documents despite the fact that he and Ratcliffe have the authority to declassify the additional intelligence at their own discretion. At the end of the day, if Trump wanted these documents declassified, he could do it himself. A senior administration official and three former administration officials with knowledge of the situation told CNN they expect the President to fire his CIA director, as he did Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, have attempted to protect Haspel from Trump's wrath in recent days, providing public displays of support for the CIA director amid speculation of her possible ouster. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas voiced his support for Haspel in a tweet Tuesday, saying: ""Intelligence should not be partisan. Not about manipulation, it is about preserving impartial, nonpartisan information necessary to inform policy makers and so the can protect the US."" The post prompted immediate backlash from the President's son Donald Trump Jr, who called Haspel a ""trained liar."" ""Have you or @marcorubio or @senatemajldr actually discussed this with anyone in the Admin. who actually works with her, like @DNI_Ratcliffe or @MarkMeadows or @robertcobrien, to get their perspective, or are you just taking a trained liar's word for it on everything?"" he tweeted, tagging McConnell and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who serves as acting chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. While Haspel's immediate future as CIA director remains uncertain, Trump moved several political allies into new roles at the Pentagon and National Security Agency this week -- placing them in career positions, which come with civil service protections. They could also have an immediate impact on the release of classified documents. Michael Ellis, an official on the National Security Council, shifted over to the National Security Agency as legal counsel, which puts him in a civil servant role at an agency at the forefront of the declassification dispute. Ellis is widely considered to be a partisan Trump loyalist and has little intelligence experience despite being elevated to the job of the White House's top national security lawyer under the President. He was part of several White House controversies, including overruling career officials over classified information in the book written by former national security adviser John Bolton. CNN has previously reported that Ellis came under scrutiny for his alleged roundabout role in providing information to GOP Rep. Devin Nunes of California, then-chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which showed members of Trump's team were included in foreign surveillance reports collected by US intelligence. Another former Nunes aide, Kash Patel, will become chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, according to an administration official and a US defense official. The House impeachment inquiry uncovered evidence connecting Patel to the diplomatic back channel led by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, and the efforts to spread conspiracy theories about Biden and coerce Ukraine into announcing an investigation of the former vice president. A third Trump loyalist with ties to Nunes, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, was also elevated to a senior role at the Pentagon this week. Cohen-Watnick gained notoriety in March 2017 for his alleged involvement with Ellis in providing intelligence materials to Nunes, who went on to claim that US intelligence officials improperly surveilled Trump associates. In his new post as the Pentagon's acting under secretary for intelligence, Cohen-Watnick could find himself at odds with Nakasone, a military officer, if he pushes for additional classified materials to be released. While it remains to be seen if Trump will ultimately fire Haspel, the elevation of officials like Ellis and Patel has raised concerns that the President is clearing the way to release documents despite previous objections from intelligence leaders. ""The motives of his recent moves at DoD and NSA remain unclear and are of course speculative, although the partisan personnel he put in place certainly suggest that he is stacking the deck, ultimately to win the fight over further declassification of intel related to the 2016 Russian investigation,"" Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer who oversaw operations in Europe and Russia before retiring last summer, told CNN. ""If he did the same at CIA, install a new hyper-partisan director who would agree to further declassification efforts, it would not only expose and compromise highly classified sources and methods, but also taint the agency in the eyes of our international partners. Simply put, that puts America at great risk,"" he added. House Republicans leading campaign to declassify secret documents Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have also pushed the narrative that Haspel is personally preventing certain documents from being released. Nunes, the panel's top Republican, repeatedly made that claim on Lou Dobbs' Fox Business program last month, while alleging that the ""intelligence services in this country have been corrupted by the Democratic national party and their propaganda arm in the media."" Some of the additional intelligence Nunes wants released comes from classified documents based on a report compiled by Republicans on the committee he chaired in 2018, according to a source familiar with the materials. The House Republican report on the Russia investigation disputes the intelligence community's finding that Russia was trying to help Trump in the 2016 campaign, raising issues about the tradecraft behind the intelligence assessment. The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee, however, confirmed the intelligence community's assessment in its bipartisan investigation into Russia's 2016 election interference. Current and former officials have maintained that if there were something revelatory in the documents that remain classified, it would have been included in either the unclassified House or Senate reports and in a way that did not compromise sources and methods. Yet House Republicans and Trump still believe the information in these secret documents will help validate their criticism of the CIA and FBI's handling of the probe -- raising more questions about whether this is just an attempt to cherry-pick intelligence. Either way, the documents are so sensitive that they remain under lock and key at CIA headquarters in Langley, according to a source familiar with the matter. House Republicans on the Intelligence Committee stored the materials in a lockbox, which this source compared to a gun safe. The lockbox was then placed in a CIA vault -- prompting some officials to characterize it as a ""turducken"" or a ""safe within a safe."" The New York Times first reported on the ""turducken."" Republicans on the House panel have long accused the CIA of blocking access to the documents and have encouraged Ratcliffe to declassify the materials despite objections by the CIA and the the National Security Agency, multiple sources told CNN. In a letter sent to the intelligence community's inspector general last month, Ratcliffe said he has asked that the documents undergo a formal declassification review at the request of Nunes but also has asked the watchdog to review whether the 2017 intelligence community assessment on Russian interference ""adhered to proper analytical tradecraft."" At the same time, Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee have accused Haspel of stonewalling their oversight efforts by refusing to produce CIA documents that were requested as part of the panel's own review of the Russia probe.",20,0.8503460625481933,4.43585907996378,-3.585513017415587,5

But the evidence shows Russia is the real danger,"For months, the Trump administration has been warning of the dangers of political interference by China in the US election. In April, President Trump said Beijing wanted him out of the White House. Attorney General William Barr and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Beijing was a bigger threat than Russia. And Bill Evanina, Director of the United States National Counterintelligence and Security Center, listed the ways that China had been ""expanding its influence efforts."" Yet, this week, China didn't feature in the latest warning about election interference. On Thursday, US national security officials accused Russian state-sponsored hackers of targeting state and local governments and of successfully stealing data in at least two instances. The allegations came shortly after officials accused Russia and Iran of using US voter registration information to undermine Trump's campaign. By contrast, very little evidence of China's alleged meddling has emerged, weeks before the vote. The China-backed foreign misinformation efforts that have been made public had a minuscule reach compared Russia's efforts before the 2016 US presidential vote. ""China studied what the Russians did in 2016 very closely,"" said cybersecurity expert James Lewis, a former foreign service officer at the Departments of State and Commerce. ""They'd like to be able to do what the Russians do, but they aren't that good at it."" However, experts predict that China's influence operations will become more formidable in the coming decades. They warn China will own more parts of the global telecommunications networks and export its system of censorship and propaganda to other governments. According to Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and information warfare expert who testified before Congress about Russian interference in the 2016 US elections, Chinese influence operations ""will be more prolific over time and successful over time because they can control the entire information environment, which is different from the Russians."" In August, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said China had never interfered in a US election and ""had no interest to do that in the future."" Russia's playbook Russia's use of disinformation dates back far before the last presidential election. The Soviet Union used the art of ""dezinformatsiya"" to forge documents, plant fake stories in the media to benefit Russian interests, and infiltrate activist groups during the Cold War. Those strategies came from the Tsarist era, when the secret police would fake materials to discredit enemies. The difference now, of course, is that those tactics have moved online. In 2014, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a secretive technology company with close ties to the Kremlin, began using fake social media accounts and group pages to target US audiences around divisive issues in the lead up to the 2016 election, according to the Mueller report. The IRA bought troves of Facebook ads and flooded Twitter with posts that boosted Trump and denigrated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the report said. In mid-2014, employees from the IRA even traveled to the US to get information and photographs to use in their social media posts. Some IRA employees, posing as Americans, communicated with the Trump campaign to try to coordinate political activities, including political rallies. More than 1,000 employees reportedly worked from an office block in St. Petersburg to run the influence campaign -- with the goal of getting Trump elected to benefit Russian interests. Those tactics are still being used, but better disguised, now that the playbook has been publicized. A CNN investigation earlier this year found a network of social media accounts targeting the US that came from people in Ghana and Nigeria, working on behalf of Russia. This September, Facebook and Twitter announced the IRA created a fake progressive website called Peace Data that engaged with real Americans and even hired some Americans to write articles, which were then shared on different social media platforms. Using domestic tactics overseas For a long time, China's online influence operations focused inward, using censorship and propaganda to control what information its citizens can see at home. A 2017 Harvard study estimated that the Chinese government produces 488 million fake social media posts a year to cheerlead the authorities and distract public attention from discussions critical of the regime. The study concluded that the Chinese government uses an enormous workforce of mostly government employees, contributing part time, to fabricate the posts. But as China's economic and political ambitions have grown, the country has increasingly applied domestic propaganda tactics to target global audiences -- ironically, using platforms it blocks at home, such as Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter. So far, this has been with limited success. Right now, China's disinformation efforts are ""sloppy and get caught very easily,"" said Watts. While China has set up a vast censorship and propaganda apparatus at home, the country does not have as much practice manipulating foreign social media platforms. ""They're used to playing on a field where they control the terrain,"" says Nimmo, of Graphika. ""It's a steep learning curve."" The pro-democracy protests that swept Hong Kong last year, however, appeared to have accelerated China's focus on global influence operations. As international news organizations reported on demonstrations in the city and protesters' demands for more civil liberties, Beijing launched a state-backed disinformation campaign about the protests on Western platforms. In August 2019, Facebook and Twitter removed accounts from China that sowed political discord and amplified messages to undermine the legitimacy of the protest movement, portraying demonstrators as violent, extreme and dangerous. One of the posts had an image of Hong Kong protesters next to ISIS fighters, with the text: ""Even though the weapons are different, the outcome is the same!"" The operation's use of automated accounts to spread disinformation and amplify divisive topics resembles Russia's tactics, according to Nick Monaco, an online disinformation expert and research director at the Institute of the Future. Some of Russia's strategies were also on display in the first public disclosures of Chinese influence operations pushing content about global issues that matter to China, such as the South China Sea, but also the 2020 US election. Facebook recently shut down more than 150 accounts from China that used fake profiles to pose as locals in countries they targeted. The accounts boosted their own content, managed Facebook pages, and liked and commented on other people's posts. Facebook said only a small amount of the overall activity was focused on the US, where the operation gained almost no following. According to Graphika, which worked with Facebook to analyze the misinformation, the group first became active in late 2016 by posting about Taiwan from a pro-Mainland position. In 2018, the operation began posting about the Philippines and Chinese influence in the region, as well as defending China's actions in the South China Sea. Activity around US politics only began in April 2019, when the operation started making Facebook profiles to pass as actual Americans on both sides of the aisle. For instance, ""Kate Selina"" was one of the fake profiles that posed as a conservative American, and shared posts criticizing Medicare-for-all and gun control policies. A liberal account posted that President Barack Obama ""is my best president ever,"" while also sharing a meme of Trump with the words ""nobody likes me"" right next to his face. The network also created Facebook pages for various US presidential candidates, including one supporting former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. The page only had two members. The operation also created a Biden-Harris group that had around 1,400 members. The Trump group only attracted three followers. In contrast, leading up to the 2016 US Presidential election, some pages run by Russia's IRA attracted hundreds of thousands of followers each. According to Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, which worked with Facebook to analyze the accounts, the US-focused part of the operation from China appeared ""to be in the audience-building stage."" The network did not push for one candidate over another. The purpose could have been to draw attention and build an audience in order to push pro-Beijing content to the groups in the future. Graphika estimated that the overall activity of the operation was limited, producing just 1.6 million interactions -- of which just a tiny fraction were related to the US -- between September 2016 and September 2020. In contrast, ahead of the 2016 Presidential elections, IRA-controlled Facebook accounts reached 126 million people, and the agency's Twitter accounts had tens of thousands of followers each, including high-profile political figures who retweeted its content, according to the report by special counsel Robert Mueller, released by the Department of Justice last year. China also faces another challenge: it is starting its influence operations in the West when social media platforms, law enforcement and independent researchers have increased efforts to detect fake activity. ""China is coming to the game later, when defenses are a lot stronger,"" Nimmo said. Russia cares more If China's threat is less severe than Russia's, that's partly because in the past, it simply hasn't cared as much about US elections. The next president won't change Washington's bipartisan consensus to be tough on China. Russia's geopolitical ambitions, however, stand to benefit far more from a Trump reelection. Trump has helped advance the Kremlin's objectives: eroding solidarity with European allies, denying Russia's 2016 election interference, withdrawing from Syria, and bolstering Russia's position in Crimea and Ukraine. That sentiment is reflected in state media, with Russian outlets publishing significantly more English-language content about the presidential election than Chinese ones, according to analysis by the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Russia's narrative is also more divisive. It's been pushing predictions of widespread election rigging and fraud via mail-in-balloting, according to Watts, the former FBI special agent. ""Russia has a clear bridge to America. They have consistently communicated and connected with Americans to influence them and support policies and candidates favorable to them,"" Watts said. ""China has no such aims. There's no presidential candidate -- not Biden or Trump -- especially post Covid, that's going to improve relations with China.""

2020-10-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/politics/russian-nationals-charged-justice-department/index.html,6 Russian military officers charged with a worldwide cyberattack,"Six Russian military officers have been charged in what the Justice Department says was a hacking scheme to attack several major foreign powers, former Soviet republics and subvert investigations into nefarious activities by the Kremlin. The alleged cyberattackers hacked into software using destructive malware to black out thousands of computers and cause nearly $1 billion in losses, and were intended to support Russian government efforts to undermine, retaliate against, or otherwise destabilize worldwide computer networks, the Justice Department said. The alleged hackers are officers of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), a military intelligence agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Monday's charges allege some of the most consequential political attacks levied by the Kremlin since its efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election, including the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts. Prosecutors said they attacked Ukraine; the country of Georgia; elections in France; efforts to hold Russia accountable for its use of a weapons-grade nerve agent, Novichok, on foreign soil; and the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games after Russian athletes were banned from participating under their nation's flag, as a consequence of Russian government-sponsored doping effort. The United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania issued a federal arrest warrant for each of these defendants upon the grand jury's return of the indictment. ""The defendants' and their co-conspirators caused damage and disruption to computer networks worldwide, including in France, Georgia, the Netherlands, Republic of Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States,"" prosecutors said. They are all charged in seven counts: conspiracy to conduct computer fraud and abuse, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, damaging protected computers, and aggravated identity theft. One of the pieces of malware developed by the hackers took down the medical systems of Heritage Valley in Pennsylvania, prosecutors said. From November 2015 to October 2019, ""their computer attacks used some of the world's most destructive malware to date, including: KillDisk and Industroyer, which each caused blackouts in Ukraine; NotPetya, which caused nearly $1 billion in losses to the three victims identified in the indictment alone; and Olympic Destroyer, which disrupted thousands of computers used to support the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics,"" prosecutors said. The NotPetya malware, for example, spread worldwide, damaged computers used in critical infrastructure, and caused enormous financial losses. Those losses were only part of the harm, however. For example, the NotPetya malware impaired Heritage Valley's provision of critical medical services to citizens of the Western District of Pennsylvania through its two hospitals, 60 offices, and 18 community satellite facilities. The attack caused the unavailability of patient lists, patient history, physical examination files, and laboratory records. Heritage Valley lost access to its mission-critical computer systems (such as those relating to cardiology, nuclear medicine, radiology, and surgery) for approximately one week and administrative computer systems for almost one month, thereby causing a threat to public health and safety. Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko, 32; Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov, 35; Pavel Valeryevich Frolov, 28; Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, 29; Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko, 27; and Petr Nikolayevich Pliskin, 32, face a maximum sentence of 27 years in prison for wire fraud. They are wanted and assumed to be in Russia. Prosecutors said Kovalev allegedly developed ""spearphishing techniques and messages"" to target: En Marche! officials; employees of the DSTL; members of the IOC and Olympic athletes; and employees of a Georgian media entity."" ""The victims who suffered real harm, as a result of these crimes are often ordinary citizens and businesses around the world,"" US Attorney Scott W. Brady said at a Monday news conference. The malware attacks disrupted the supply of electricity to more than 225,000 Ukrainian customers during the cold winter months of December 2015, according to the indictment. When Ukraine was preparing their end of year pension payments, as well as the following year's budget, there was a destructive malware attack against Ukraine's Ministry of Finance and their state security service. During this attack, the conspirators used an updated version of KillDisk malware in December 2016, that caused the network to go down and prevented the execution of approximately 150,000 electronic payment transactions, according to the indictment. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the charges ""highlight once again Russia's continuing disruptive, destructive, and destabilizing activities in cyberspace."" ""We call on Russia to put an end to its irresponsible behavior. Furthermore, we call upon all states that wish to see greater stability in cyberspace to join us in helping bring the actors charged today to justice,"" he said in a statement. The new indictments were the latest attempt by the US to crack down on the Russian intelligence agency known as the GRU, which was responsible for interfering in the 2016 election. GRU hackers stole tens of thousands of emails from top Democrats and weaponized material through WikiLeaks releases during the 2016 campaign, helping Donald Trump and weakening Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Kovalev and 11 other GRU operatives were charged in 2018 with conspiring to hack the Democratic National Committee and Clinton's campaign chairman. The charges were brought by special counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation provided the most detailed account of how GRU hackers aggressively went after Western targets. Kovalev has yet to face a judge in Washington, DC, for the outstanding charges. ""For this type of activity, they might be safe now. In the future, they're gonna have to be looking over their shoulders,"" said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.",20,3.887695750024531,5.298237274992544,-1.4105415249680129,1
2020-09-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/22/politics/trump-putin-election-interference-intelligence-assessment/index.html,Trump says he likes Putin. US intelligence says Russia is attacking American democracy.,"Despite repeated warnings from intelligence officials and his own FBI director that Russia is carrying out a blatant attack on American democracy, President Donald Trump summed up his views at a rally on Monday in very simple terms, ""I like Putin, he likes me."" Trump has consistently expressed a personal affinity for his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, since taking office nearly four years ago. US But the fact that his latest comments come as US intelligence agencies are sounding the alarm about Moscow's ongoing interference in the 2020 election offers a stark reminder that Trump has no problem with foreign meddling if it appears to help him politically. It also marks yet another instance in which Trump has undercut his intelligence community ahead of the November election. He not only refuses to condemn Russia for interfering in the American democratic process, but is also seeking to downplay the threat posed by Moscow. In many ways, it's a repeat performance of 2016, where he capitalized on Russian meddling and then denied that it happened. But while Trump and several top allies have recently sought to cast China as the greatest threat to the election, evidence continues to emerge suggesting Russia is not only already interfering, as FBI director Christopher Wray explicitly told House lawmakers last week, but it is doing so at the direction of Putin and other senior Kremlin officials, according to a Washington Post report published Tuesday. The CIA assessed in August that Putin and his top aides ""are aware of and probably directing Russia's influence operations"" aimed at undermining Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, the Post story reads. ""We assess that President Vladimir Putin and the senior most Russian officials are aware of and probably directing Russia's influence operations aimed at denigrating the former US Vice President, supporting the US president and fueling public discord ahead of the US election in November,"" the first line of the assessment reads, according to the Post. The assessment mirrors what US intelligence agencies concluded after 2016: that Putin personally directed the pro-Trump meddling campaign that year. Shades of 2016 While US intelligence agencies have publicly accused Russia of actively interfering in the 2020 election, seeking to denigrate Biden's White House bid, the agencies did not provide any assessment of Putin's potential involvement. ""We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment.' This is consistent with Moscow's public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration's policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,"" William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said in a statement in August. The US accused Putin in 2017 of directing all efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. ""We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,"" US intelligence said in a statement following the 2016 election. In his statement from August, Evanina also accused pro-Russian Ukrainian politician Adrii Derkach of ""spreading claims about corruption"" to undermine Biden's candidacy. The Post reported Tuesday that the CIA assessment details Derkach's efforts to spread and boost anti-Biden information through lobbyists, Congress and US news outlets. Though the document refers to Derkach interacting with a ""prominent"" person tied to Trump's campaign, it does not identify the person, according to the Post. Derkach has close ties to Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who the Post reports is not named in the CIA assessment. Over the past year, Derkach has worked closely with Giuliani and right-wing outlets like One America News Network to peddle anti-Biden material, according to past CNN reporting and Derkach's public statements. Derkach has released and promoted alleged audiotapes of a 2016 conversation between Biden and then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The US Treasury sanctioned Derkach earlier this month and labeled him an ""active Russian agent."" However, Trump appears to be on a different page to the rest of his administration and even retweeted a post containing snippets of the audio last month -- accusing Biden of improprieties, though there is no proof of wrongdoing on the tapes. The President also continues to promote friendly relations with Putin on the campaign trail. ""I like Putin. He likes me. We get along. Wouldn't you say it's smart to get along? OK? It's smart,"" he told supporters in Ohio on Monday. Trump still sensitive about all things Russia Trump's stance is consistent with his long-standing reluctance to criticize Russia for its meddling in US elections, both past and present. US intelligence agencies, special counsel Robert Mueller and bipartisan reports from Congress have released overwhelming evidence that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump. Trump has vociferously denied that his campaign colluded with Russia. But he has also repeatedly denied the reality that Russia meddled in the election. Instead, Trump has embraced conspiracy theories that absolve Russia of responsibility. He even publicly accepted Putin's denials during their infamous 2018 summit in Finland, which former national security adviser John Bolton described in his book, ""The Room Where It Happened,"" as a ""self-inflicted wound"" for Trump. Several former national security officials who served in the Trump administration have said the President remains very sensitive about the issue of Russian election interference due to personal insecurities about how Moscow worked to help his campaign during the 2016 race and an obsession with winning in 2020. Trump aides told Mueller that the President thinks acknowledging Russia's role in the 2016 election would delegitimize his upset victory over Hillary Clinton. As such, Trump has recently decried any suggestion that Russia's threat to the upcoming election is as dangerous as China's as equivalent to the partisan ""witch hunt"" against him -- a view that has been factored into the messaging of administration officials, who have focused their public comments on Beijing and downplayed Moscow's actions, sources told CNN. Trump has also failed to call out Russia or confront Putin directly over a variety of other actions that have impacted the US and its allies, including reported intelligence indicating Moscow offered bounties to the Taliban to target American troops in Afghanistan. More recently, Trump has refused to say whether he believes Putin and the Kremlin were responsible for poisoning Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny last month despite the fact that several other world leaders have demanded answers. ""Uh ... We'll talk about that at another time,"" Trump told reporters on Monday when asked about the incident. Asked if the President of the United States has an obligation to call out Putin and other Russian officials publicly for their actions, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on CNN Tuesday: ""Well, of course."" ""That's kind of what's missing here. I'm sure a lot has been done at the federal and state and local level, but what is missing here is the voice that can only come from the bully pulpit of the president to dime out what the Russians are doing and to caution American voters to recognize what the Russians are doing, and for whatever reason we don't have that,"" he added. The Biden campaign has attempted to seize on Trump's reluctance to criticize Russia, attacking the President for remaining silent on a host of issues, including election interference. ""This president is even giving Russia impunity for offering bounties to terrorists for murdering American troops. As Joe Biden has said for months, it is absolutely clear who Vladimir Putin wants to win this election — because Donald Trump's foreign policy has been a gift to the Kremlin,"" campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement reacting to the Washington Post story published Tuesday. Bates also condemned Trump's allies in Congress for choosing ""to be accessories to foreign influence operations against the very sovereignty of the United States,"" an apparent reference to an investigation into the former vice president's dealings in Ukraine being conducted by Senate Republicans.",20,2.2797607818685153,0.4170260504753046,1.8627347313932106,14

The CIA compiled its August 31 assessment with input from the National Security Agency and the FBI using public, unclassified and classified intelligence sources, the Post reported, citing two sources who reviewed the document. The CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. CNN has also reached out to the National Security Agency and the FBI. The agencies declined to comment to the Post. Former CIA officer Douglas London told CNN that the agency's use of the word ""probably"" when concerning an issue of such importance means its ""analysts are sufficiently confident based on their deep expertise to put their reputations on the line in making such a call."" ""It means the intel is good enough that they're not guessing, but have enough pieces of the puzzle to confidently make out the image,"" London said. While US intelligence has publicly accused Russia of actively interfering in the 2020 election, seeking to denigrate Biden's White House bid, the agencies did not provide any assessment of Putin's potential involvement.

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told CNN's John King on ""Newsroom"" on Tuesday that the report serves as ""confirmation"" of what both Evanina and FBI Director Christopher Wray have said about Russia's efforts to meddle in the election. ""So this is simply affirmation, confirmation of what has already been said both by Director Wray of the FBI and Bill Evanina, who is director of the National CounterIntelligence and Security Center, who is kind of the nominal spokesman for election interference on behalf of the director of national intelligence,"" said Clapper, who served in the Obama administration. Clapper, a CNN contributor, added that the report is ""significant but not surprising,"" adding: ""Given Putin's background -- a trained career KGB officer -- he has a very astute and sophisticated understanding of the tools that he can use to interfere with our election process and to sow discord and distrust, which he is doing fairly well."" The Post reported that the CIA assessment details Derkach's efforts to spread and boost anti-Biden information through lobbyists, Congress, and US news outlets. Though the document refers to Derkach interacting with a ""prominent"" person tied to President Donald Trump's campaign, it does not identify the person, according to the Post.

The US Treasury sanctioned Derkach because of those efforts and labeled him an ""active Russian agent."" ""Derkach and other Russian agents employ manipulation and deceit to attempt to influence elections in the United States and elsewhere around the world,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement earlier this month. Giuliani has acknowledged that he received documents from Derkach about Biden. Asked earlier this month about the sanctions against Derkach, Giuliani told CNN via text, ""Who cares."" ""I never put any of his information in my report to State, and met (Derkach) long after my investigation was over,"" Giuliani told CNN last month, referring to a controversial packet of documents he gave to the US State Department last year as part of his efforts to dig up dirt on Biden. Derkach recently dismissed the notion that he is a Russian agent, calling the allegations from the US government ""absurd"" and illogical during a freewheeling press conference in Ukraine that quickly devolved into a nonsensical spectacle. The US intelligence community declined to comment on Derkach's specific activities after he spoke out. But an official from the ODNI reiterated the agency's public assessment from August that the Ukrainian lawmaker ""is spreading claims about corruption -- including through publicizing leaked phone calls -- to undermine former Vice President Biden's candidacy and the Democratic Party."" ""We stand by our previous public statement on Mr. Derkach and note the Sept. 10 Treasury Department designation of Derkach for his efforts to influence the 2020 election,"" the official told CNN recently. Derkach has released and promoted alleged audiotapes of a 2016 conversation between Biden and then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Last month, Trump retweeted a post containing snippets of the audio and accusing Biden of improprieties, though there is no proof of wrongdoing on the tapes. A spokesman for Biden's campaign said Tuesday that the CIA assessment makes clear who Putin wants to win the election because ""Donald Trump's foreign policy has been a gift to the Kremlin.""

2020-09-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/17/politics/fbi-director-wray-russia-election-interference/index.html,FBI director Wray says Russia is actively interfering in 2020 election to 'denigrate' Biden,"FBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday that Russia has been ""very active"" in its efforts to influence US elections, with the primary goal being to ""denigrate"" Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee, Wray told lawmakers that Russia is primarily interfering through ""malign foreign influence in an effort to hurt Biden's campaign"" -- echoing the intelligence community's public assessment on Moscow's meddling efforts issued last month. Wray's comments come as President Donald Trump and several other top administration officials have recently attempted to play up the theory that China is meddling to get Biden elected, while downplaying well-founded reports that Russia is trying to help Trump win again, like it did in 2016. Foreign election interference efforts differ from what was observed in 2016, when there was also an effort to target election infrastructure, Wray said. ""We have not seen that second part yet this year or this cycle, but we certainly have seen very active, very active efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020,"" he added. According to Wray, Russia is using social media, proxies, state media and online journals to sow ""divisiveness and discord"" and ""primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden and what the Russians see as kind of an anti-Russian establishment."" Intelligence officials have said they have uncovered evidence that Russia is currently interfering in the election to hurt Biden's campaign. Separately, some evidence has already emerged about Moscow's efforts, including Facebook's announcement earlier this month that a troll group that was part of Russia's attempt to interfere in the 2016 election is trying to target Americans again. But while the intelligence community has assessed that China and Iran prefer Trump to lose in November, officials have offered no indication, to date, that either country is acting on that preference in the same way as Russia, according to public statements issued by the intelligence community and sources familiar with the underlying evidence. ""We assess that China prefers that President Trump -- whom Beijing sees as unpredictable -- does not win reelection. China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China,"" the top US intelligence official on election security, Bill Evanina, said in an unprecedented public statement issued last month. Evanina went on to say, ""China will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action,"" but to date has primarily engaged in overt efforts like ramping up public criticism of the current administration over non-election-related issues, including its coronavirus response and move to close Beijing's consulate in Houston. Russia, on the other hand, is using a range of measures primarily to denigrate Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia establishment, Evanina wrote in the same statement. ""This is consistent with Moscow's public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration's policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,"" Evanina said. ""Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television."" But in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer earlier this month, Attorney General William Barr went out of his way to dilute the intelligence community's assessment that Russia is again actively interfering in a US election. ""I accept that there is some preliminary activity that suggests that they might try again,"" Barr said of Russia. ""It wouldn't surprise me if Russia tries something again of the same general genre before."" US intelligence officials and the Senate Intelligence Committee have made bolder assertions warning of the threat Russia poses this year after it hacked the Democrats in 2016 and ran social media influence operations during the 2016 and 2018 elections. ""The threat is ongoing,"" Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican who chaired much of the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian election interference, said in a statement last month after the panel released the findings of its bipartisan probe. ""My hope is that this report and the Committee's work will provide the American people with more insight into the threats facing our nation and the steps necessary to stop them."" Wray: Antifa is 'an ideology' Wray also testified that the majority of protesters in the streets are peaceful. ""There's no question the biggest number is peaceful protesters,"" Wray said. Wray was pressed repeatedly, mainly by Republicans, about the threat from Antifa. He responded that they are not a group or organization but rather a movement or ideology. ""We look at Antifa as more of an ideology or a movement than an organization. To be clear, we do have quite a number of properly predicated domestic terrorism investigations into violent anarchist extremists, any number of whom self-identify with the Antifa movement, and that's part of this broader group of domestic violent extremists,"" Wray said. Some individual are being investigated, as are smaller regional ""nodes,"" Wray said. Antifa is on the spectrum of anti-government movements on both the left and the right, he added. This story has been updated with Wray's comments on Antifa.",20,0.824126379532007,0.40037484893492337,0.4237515305970836,14
2020-09-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/07/politics/trump-election-interference-china-biden/index.html,Trump pushes misleading claim China is stoking protests to help Biden win election,"President Donald Trump suggested on Monday that China is interfering in the 2020 election and attempting to hurt his reelection bid by encouraging race protests, tweeting an article written by a columnist whose claims do not match the US intelligence community's assessment of Beijing's efforts so far. These comments from Trump, and similar claims that have been made by many of his appointees, seek to achieve the same goal: playing up the theory that China is meddling to get Biden elected, while downplaying well-founded reports that Russia is trying to help Trump win again, like it did in 2016. Trump tweeted a Breitbart article quoting author and columnist Gordon Chang, who said the Chinese Communist Party is ""trying to make life very difficult"" for the President by ""fueling"" violent Black Lives Matter protests. ""From what little evidence we have about China's troll-farm activity, with its bots and with all of its others, they seem to be favoring Vice President Biden, trying trying to make life very difficult for President Trump — as well as fueling the protests, of course,"" Chang stated. ""I think that Beijing has decided that it's voting for the Democratic Party candidate."" It was not immediately clear where Chang's information comes from but the US government and Silicon Valley have not offered any public assessment about alleged covert Chinese troll farm activity similar to what he described. Chang did not respond to CNN's request for comment regarding the origins of the information he cited. The only public comments from these groups about election meddling on social media have focused on pro-Trump activity that is tied to the Kremlin. Additionally, the article seems to run counter to what US intelligence officials tasked with protecting the 2020 election from foreign interference have said publicly. Intelligence officials have said they have uncovered evidence that Russia is currently interfering in the election to hurt Biden's campaign. Separately, some evidence has already emerged about Moscow's efforts, including Facebook's announcement last week that a troll group that was part of Russia's attempt to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election is trying to target Americans again. But while the intelligence community has assessed that China and Iran prefer Trump to lose in November, officials have offered no indication, to date, that either country is acting on that preference in the same way as Russia, according to public statements issued by the intelligence community and sources familiar with the underlying evidence. ""We assess that China prefers that President Trump -- whom Beijing sees as unpredictable -- does not win reelection. China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China,"" the top US intelligence official on election security, Bill Evanina, said in an unprecedented public statement issued last month. Evanina went on to say, ""China will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action,"" but to date has primarily engaged in overt efforts like ramping up public criticism of the current administration over non-election-related issues, including its coronavirus response and move to close Beijing's consulate in Houston. Russia, on the other hand, is using a range of measures primarily to denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia establishment, Evanina wrote in the same statement. ""This is consistent with Moscow's public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration's policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,"" Evanina said. ""Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television."" Former CIA officer John Sipher told CNN that there is a clear difference in the way Evanina characterizes the threats posed by China and Russia. ""The simple difference is between covert interference on one side and public preferences. China is using influence, diplomacy and commentary in press and propaganda organs. Russia is using disinformation, fake accounts, bots, covert funding as part of a secret campaign,"" he told CNN. Blurring the line While Republicans have consistently raised concerns about China's influence efforts targeting Americans, several sources familiar with briefings provided to lawmakers told CNN that intelligence officials have yet to present clear evidence showing Beijing is actively interfering in the election or taking specific steps to boost one candidate over the other. Instead, intelligence and election security officials have focused, both privately and publicly, on the holistic threat posed by China, emphasizing that Beijing employs a variety of ""malign tactics"" that could have implications on the 2020 race. ""China is engaged in a highly sophisticated malign foreign influence campaign, and its methods include bribery, blackmail, and covert deals. Chinese diplomats also use both open, naked economic pressure and seemingly independent middlemen to push China's preferences on American officials,"" FBI Director Chris Wray said in July. But Trump has repeatedly blurred the line between those broader national security concerns and allegations that China is actively meddling in the election. At the same time, he has all but ignored the intelligence community's warning about Russia's ongoing efforts to ""denigrate"" Biden. Last week, Trump retweeted a post from his handpicked intelligence chief, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, that linked to a misleading Fox News story with the headline: ""China's anti-Trump election meddling raises new alarm."" And on Monday, Trump amplified comments that, on the surface, appeared to bolster the narrative that China is interfering to help Biden but came from a source whose views are considered well outside the mainstream and at times have lacked credibility. Trump officials wary of equating threat from Russia and China The President has also recently decried any suggestion that Russia poses an equally dangerous threat as China as equivalent to the partisan ""witch hunt"" against him -- a view that has been factored into the messaging of administration officials, who have focused their public comments on Beijing and downplayed Moscow's actions, sources told CNN. Monday's tweet from Trump comes after several of his top national security officials misleadingly suggested there is evidence China is actively interfering in the upcoming US election, according to Sipher, while downplaying what various agencies have characterized as more immediate concerns around Russia's ongoing efforts to meddle in the 2020 presidential race. National security adviser Robert O'Brien said Friday that he agrees ""100%"" with Attorney General William Barr's assertion that China is being more aggressive with its attempts to influence the 2020 election than other malign actors, including Russia, but offered little evidence to back up the claim. ""What the intelligence community has made very clear,"" O'Brien told reporters during a news briefing at the White House on Friday, ""first you have China, which has the most massive program to influence the United States politically, you have Iran and you have Russia. These are all three adversary countries that are seeking to disrupt our elections."" ""Some of them prefer Biden; some people say some of them prefer the President,"" he said, notably sounding certain that some are pushing for Biden but casting some level of doubt on whether some are pushing for Trump. ""My position is it doesn't matter what these countries want, that any country that attempts to interfere with free and fair elections of the United States has to be stopped."" In addition to highlighting the threat posed by China, Barr went out of his way to dilute the intelligence community's assessment that Russia is again actively interfering in a US election, during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. ""I accept that there is some preliminary activity that suggests that they might try again,"" Barr said of Russia. ""It wouldn't surprise me if Russia tries something again of the same general genre before."" US intelligence officials and the Senate Intelligence Committee have made bolder assertions warning of the threat Russia poses this year after it hacked the Democrats in 2016 and ran social media influence operations during the 2016 and 2018 elections. ""The threat is ongoing,"" Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican who chaired much of the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian election interference, said in a statement last month after the panel released the findings of its bipartisan probe. ""My hope is that this report and the Committee's work will provide the American people with more insight into the threats facing our nation and the steps necessary to stop them."" But the Trump campaign and some Republicans responded to the report with a backward-looking critique and insistence there had been ""no collusion,"" rather than questioning how American politics may still be vulnerable to foreign disinformation and interference in 2020. That reaction, coupled with recent comments downplaying Russia's ongoing efforts, have prompted Democrats to accuse the President and his allies of misconstruing what US intelligence shows about the threat of foreign interference ahead of November. Sipher, whose 28-year career at the CIA included a stint running the agency's Russia operations, called the comments about China from top Trump officials ""pure deflection."" ""If someone says Russia is worse, Republican politicians can point at the larger geopolitical threat from China. True, but not relevant to the issue of election interference. Only one power is trying to subvert the election,"" he said. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff went as far as accusing Trump officials like Barr of ""lying"" when saying the intelligence shows China is actively interfering. ""If you look at what the intelligence director Evanina, who runs the National Counterintelligence Center, what he said in his public written statement, he said that Russia was actively interfering, actively engaging across a range of measures to influence the outcome. China had a preference. And if you look at that, you can tell that Bill Barr is just flat-out lying to the American people, and it's tragic but it's as simple as that,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash. The California Democrat also said he's confident he's seen the same intelligence as Barr and other top officials who have said China is interfering more aggressively than Russia.",20,0.2977565572881474,2.026492135019161,-1.7287355777310136,14
2020-08-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/29/politics/office-of-director-of-national-intelligence-congress-election-security/index.html,Top intelligence office informs congressional committees it'll no longer brief in-person on election security,"The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has informed the House and Senate Select Committees on Intelligence that it'll no longer be briefing in-person on election security issues, according to letters obtained by CNN. Instead, ODNI will primarily provide written updates to the congressional panels, a senior administration official said. The official added that other agencies supporting election security, including the Department of Justice, Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, intend to continue briefing Congress. Still, the abrupt announcement is a change that runs counter to the pledge of transparency and regular briefings on election threats by the intelligence community. It also comes after the top intelligence official on election security issued a statement earlier this month saying China, Russia and Iran are seeking to interfere in the 2020 US election, a warning that prompted some backlash from Democrats on Capitol Hill who have continued to push for the public release of more information about the nature of those efforts. US officials charged with protecting the 2020 election also said last week that they have ""no information or intelligence"" foreign countries, including Russia, are attempting to undermine any part of the mail-in voting process, contradicting President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pushed false claims that foreign adversaries are targeting mail ballots as part of a ""rigged"" presidential race. Specifically, a senior intelligence official discounted the possibility of foreign actors mass producing fake ballots to interfere in the November elections, again breaking with Trump who has continued to insist that mail-in voting poses a significant threat to election security. ""We have no information or intelligence that any nation state threat actor is engaging in activity ... to undermine any part of the mail-in vote or ballots,"" the official told reporters on Wednesday. Trump said Saturday that Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe ""got tired of"" information leaking ""so, he wants to do it in a different form."" ""Director Ratcliffe brought information into the committee, and the information leaked,"" Trump said at an event in Texas. ""So, he wants to do it in a different form because you have leakers on the committee, obviously, leakers that are doing bad things, probably not even legal to leak, but we'll look into that separately,"" Trump said. In response to Trump's accusations about leaks, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff tweeted, ""As usual, President Trump is lying and projecting. Trump fired the last DNI for briefing Congress on Russian efforts to help his campaign. Now he's ending briefings altogether. Trump doesn't want the American people to know about Russia's efforts to aid his re-election."" 'Shocking abdication' of lawful responsibility Although the letter from the ODNI to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is stamped as having been delivered Friday, a source in the speaker's office said the office only received the letter Saturday evening after 5 p.m., via email, hours after the story broke on CNN and hours after CNN obtained a copy of it. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer only received his letter late Saturday, too, according to a Schumer aide. The House Intelligence Committee received verbal notification of the change on Friday, without rationale, it but did not receive the ODNI letter until Saturday after 5 p.m., a source said, and the Senate Intelligence Committee received it at 5:10 p.m. Democratic leaders on Saturday denounced the decision by the ODNI to no longer provide in-person briefings to members of Congress, including the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, on election security. ""This is a shocking abdication of its lawful responsibility to keep the Congress currently informed, and a betrayal of the public's right to know how foreign powers are trying to subvert our democracy. This intelligence belongs to the American people, not the agencies which are its custodian. And the American people have both the right and the need to know that another nation, Russia, is trying to help decide who their president should be,"" Pelosi and Schiff said in a statement. ""The ODNI had requested the opportunity to brief the intelligence committees and the full US House of Representatives in mid-September and has now cancelled those briefings and said it would hold no others. This is shameful and -- coming only weeks before the election -- demonstrates that the Trump Administration is engaged in a politicized effort to withhold election-related information from Congress and the American people at the precise moment that greater transparency and accountability is required,"" Pelosi and Schiff added. Schumer on Saturday also called the decision not to provide briefings an ""abdication of the Intelligence Community's duty"" and said Ratcliffe ""has made clear he's in the job only to protect Trump from democracy, not democracy from Trump."" ""Our intelligence officials have said there's an active, ongoing assault on our democratic process from Russia. President Trump is simply using John Ratcliffe to hide the ugly truth from the American people - that the President is again receiving the help of the Kremlin,"" the New York Democrat said in a statement. Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the decision to stop in-person briefings an ""unprecedented attempt to politicize an issue -- protecting our democracy from foreign intervention -- that should be non-partisan."" ""Russia interfered in our elections in 2016, and they're doing it again in 2020. One (of) the lessons we should draw from what happened in 2016 is that Congress and the American public need to know more information about the election interference threat — not less,"" the Virginia Democrat said a statement. Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign condemned the move and called on it to be reversed. ""For his administration to constrain the information being provided to the peoples' representatives in Congress as this national security threat multiplies -- especially given Donald Trump's unprecedented welcoming of these assaults on our democracy for his own gain -- is deeply alarming. This should be reversed immediately,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement Saturday. Acting Senate Intelligence Chairman Marco Rubio suggested in a statement late Saturday that he had pressed Ratcliffe to commit to fully informing Congress on election security matters. ""I have spoken to the Director Radcliffe who stated unequivocally that he will continue to fulfill these obligations. In particular, he made explicitly clear that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence will continue receiving briefings on all oversight topics, including election matters,"" the Florida Republican said. But there's no indication in-person briefings will resume. Rubio also slammed the leaks stemming from previous briefings. An ODNI official defended the move Saturday, telling CNN that Ratcliffe ""is committed to meeting our statutory responsibilities and keeping Congress fully and currently informed."" ""For clarity and to protect sensitive intelligence from unauthorized disclosures, we will primarily do that through written finished intelligence products. We are concerned with unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information following recent briefings,"" the official said. Frustration over leaks Intelligence officials have previously expressed frustration over information presented in classified sessions with congressional committees leaking to the press but offered no indication of a coming change to the briefing format. ""In an election year, we recognize that no matter what the U.S. Intelligence Community says on this issue, it will be parsed, spun and likely criticized in the U.S. political ecosystem. The bottom line is that this represents the most current, accurate and objective election threat information the Intelligence Community has to offer the public at this time,"" an ODNI official told CNN earlier this month. ""The steps we have taken thus far to inform the public and other key stakeholders on threats to the election ... are unprecedented for the Intelligence Community. We will continue providing election threat updates to the American public, the presidential campaigns, political committees, and members of Congress,"" the ODNI official added. Last month, the top intelligence official for election security, Bill Evanina, also reiterated a commitment to providing ""robust intelligence-based briefings on election security"" to key stakeholders that include Congress, along with the political parties and presidential campaigns. A shift to written briefings will undoubtedly limit lawmakers' ability to ask questions of intelligence officials in real time, according to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. ""With a written release or a written report, you avoid the back-and-forth of questions, some of which could be quite probing. And I think, I think the DNI would like to avoid that and avoid the risk of saying something that might incur the wrath of the President,"" Clapper said on Saturday. ""I think this is a terrible thing with respect to the need to inform the electorate about what foreign nations are doing to interfere in our political process, most notably the Russians,"" added Clapper, a CNN contributor. CNN has reached out to committee officials for comment. Intelligence officials warned Russia seeking to 'denigrate' Biden Earlier this month, Evanina released an unprecedented statement saying China ""prefers"" an outcome where President Donald Trump is not reelected in November and Russia is working to ""denigrate"" Biden's White House bid. ""We assess that China prefers that President Trump -- whom Beijing sees as unpredictable -- does not win reelection,"" he wrote. ""China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China."" ""We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment.' This is consistent with Moscow's public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration's policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,"" Evanina added. Evanina also stated that Iran is seeking to ""undermine US democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country."" At the time, Pelosi and Schiff said Evanina's statement improved on the previous warning about foreign election interference he issued in July, but ""still treats three actors of differing intent and capability as equal threats to our democratic elections.""

2020-08-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/22/europe/europe-us-troop-movement-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,Trump's planned troop pullout from Germany has many military holes,"When United States and Polish officials signed a deal to support more combat troops in Poland, the country's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, said the move put American troops where they needed to be. ""The presence of American troops in Poland enhances our deterrence potential because we are closer to the potential source of conflict,"" Czaputowicz said in a joint appearance Saturday with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""It is important that they should be deployed in Poland, and not in Germany,"" Poland's top diplomat said. ""The art of war assures us that the capability of deterrence is higher if the army is deployed in the right place."" The boost for Poland is part of a Trump administration plan to pull some 12,000 US troops from Germany announced last month. While 1,000 of those will join 4,500 US troops already in Poland, others will move to Belgium or Italy or back to the US, available to be sent back to Europe or other world hotspots should the need arise. For decades, US personnel stationed in Germany have been viewed on both sides of the Atlantic as the foundation of the post-World War II order. At the height of the Cold War, the US maintained up to 400,000 troops in Europe, the majority in Germany. As was the case in decades past, the potential source of conflict remains Russia -- and the threat of possible incursion, as alluded to by Czaputowicz. However, elected officials in the US and among its NATO allies said the move to reposition troops could actually benefit Moscow. Republican US Sen. Mitt Romney last month called the plan ""a grave error"" and ""a gift to Russia."" The head of the German Parliament's foreign relations committee, Norbert Roettgen, tweeted: ""Instead of strengthening #NATO it is going to weaken the alliance. The US's military clout will not increase, but decrease in relation to Russia and the Near & Middle East."" How could that ""military clout"" decrease? Deterrence is one example. The last large US reduction of its troop presence in Germany occurred in 2012. Two years later, Russian troops moved into the Crimea and Moscow annexed the Ukrainian territory, spiking tensions with NATO. US and European military experts tell CNN the new troop reduction plan would provide few benefits on any potential future battlefield, and certainly not enough to justify its enormous cost, estimated to be in the billions of dollars. Specifically, the Trump administration plan pulls 11,900 troops from Germany, redeploying 5,400 of those elsewhere in Europe and sending the remaining ones back to the US with some of them rotating back to Europe at some point. Key movements include command and control centers going from Germany to Belgium as well as Army airborne troops and Air Force F-16 fighters moving from Germany to Italy. Where is the right place for US troops? Nick Reynolds, a land warfare research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, doesn't see much benefit from the US plans. ""Moving ground troops to Belgium and Italy puts them farther away from areas in which they are likely to be needed,"" Reynolds said. ""Even if they went to northern Italy, and a crisis happened to occur in southeastern Europe, transport links would make moving them slightly more time consuming."" Consider where the possible flashpoints are. In a paper written earlier this year, before the troop movements were announced, Iulia-Sabina Joja, a post-doctoral fellow at the Foreign Policy Institute of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, painted three scenarios that involve conflict around the Black Sea, including new flareups with Ukraine near the Crimea. Getting ground forces in numbers to those spots from Italy means getting them through the mountains of the Alps, which would not be in the way of a move from Germany. Even though Poland is closer to Russia, the potential Black Sea hotspots and another possible flashpoint along the border with the NATO allies in the Baltics, boosting troops in that country isn't necessarily the answer, Reynolds said. ""If ground troops were moved to Poland then they would potentially be able to get to where they were needed faster, though they also start (depending where they are in Poland) to become vulnerable in the (unlikely) event of a Russian offensive that achieves operational surprise,"" Reynolds said. Bastian Giegerich, director of defense and military analysis at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, questioned the effectiveness of rotating troops back into Europe from the United States. ""Aside from being expensive, troops on rotational deployment will struggle to develop a similar degree of local knowledge and links to host nation armed forces,"" Giegerich said. And while rotational deployments would give the Pentagon some flexibility to respond to hotspots worldwide, there is a price to be paid in the European theater: Fewer boots on the ground mean less deterrence than if they were there, Giegerich said. ""It is a fine balance to strike -- the ability to respond to contingencies around the globe with a bigger strategic reserve pool in the US might make it somewhat more likely that those contingencies arise in the first place,"" he said. Retired US Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, now a CNN military analyst, has years of military experience in Europe, beginning in 1975 and continuing intermittently until 2011. ""Germany is key, because it is central to both the 'old Europe' to the west and the newer states to the east,"" Hertling said. ""The rail and airports are terrific in Germany, and given its centralized position and ease in dealing with the government of Germany, we could fly anywhere, as well as bring allies into the training center at Grafenwoehr,"" he said. The Trump administration's German pullout sacrifices those efficiencies, Hertling said. ""The POTUS saying he's going to put forces into Italy and Belgium makes no sense. Italy is south of the Alps, with challenges in the government, and Belgium is west -- farther away from the eastern block of nations."" And then there's the cost. Hertling points out the US military has spent billions over the years to make Germany its central location in Europe. Pulling out of those bases means spending money on new infrastructure that's already been paid for in Germany. Numbers vs. location But where US troops are in Europe may be missing a bigger point, said Reynolds, the RUSI analyst. ""What is a more important issue is that the US does not keep adequate forces in Europe if the intention is to be able to quickly respond to a contingency involving Russian aggression,"" he said. And the NATO allies can't do the job alone. ""NATO forces are also working with too few units compared to the size of Russian forces that they would potentially face, at least until larger and heavier US forces could arrive from the continental US,"" Reynolds said. The Trump administration's pullout from Germany doesn't address another US/NATO deficiency in Europe -- it doesn't have enough runways that can handle alliance fighter aircraft. ""This is absolutely the issue that NATO faces in the air domain with being unable to adequately disperse its aircraft -- particularly fighter and strike aircraft, which need longer and better-reinforced runways -- to avoid having them concentrated on a few airfields that are therefore easier to target with long-range precision fires, either destroying the aircraft on the ground or negating their ability to use airfields by rendering the runway unserviceable,"" Reynolds said. In any event, the plan would take years execute and Congress would have to find the billions of dollars needed to make it happen. And with a US election less than three months away, new thinking could emerge with a possible new occupant of the White House. The Germany pullout is far from a done deal.",4,6.592571935503905,5.717583073965301,0.8749888615386041,26
2020-08-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/politics/2020-election-russia-china-iran/index.html,"Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working to 'denigrate' Biden","The US intelligence community's top election security official said in a statement Friday that China ""prefers"" an outcome where President Donald Trump is not reelected in November and Russia is working to ""denigrate"" former Vice President Joe Biden's White House bid. ""We assess that China prefers that President Trump -- whom Beijing sees as unpredictable -- does not win reelection,"" said William R. Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, in a statement updating the election threat landscape heading into the November election. ""China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China."" ""We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment.' This is consistent with Moscow's public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration's policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,"" Evanina added. Evanina also stated that Iran is seeking to ""undermine US democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country."" In essence, Evanina's statement Friday afternoon put two of the biggest American adversaries on opposite sides of the election: Russia for Trump and China for Biden. The statement from the top counterintelligence official is also the clearest the intelligence community has been in suggesting Russia prefers one candidate over the other in the 2020 race. At a news conference at his Bedminster, New Jersey, country club on Friday night, Trump appeared reluctant to accept the intelligence community findings. Asked if he believes the intelligence, the President replied, ""It could be. I mean it could be, very much."" ""I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody's been tougher on Russia -- ever,"" Trump said, adding later, ""the last thing that Russia wants, and China wants, and Iran wants is for Donald Trump to win."" Asked what he would do in response, Trump didn't offer a concrete action, saying, ""Well, we're going to look at it very closely."" He continued his unfounded attacks against vote by mail, arguing that it's the ""biggest risk"" to election security and easy for a foreign power to forge ballots. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud associated with vote by mail. Evanina's use of the word ""denigrate"" is also the term the intelligence community used in its 2017 assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an ""influence campaign"" aimed at harming Hillary Clinton. The intelligence community also concluded that Russia's ""clear preference"" was Trump and aspired to help him, an assessment Trump has pushed back on. Russia's goals were to ""denigrate"" Clinton, the intelligence community's 2017 report stated. The prospect of interference in 2020 will further test US defenses against foreign meddling, which Trump has repeatedly downplayed as he has dismissed any suggestion that Kremlin influence played a role in his election. CNN reported Friday that US intelligence officials presented information to lawmakers and presidential campaigns indicating Russia is behind an ongoing disinformation push targeting Biden. Biden's campaign advisers have already discussed Evanina's assessment, according to one person familiar with the discussions. The team has specifically focused on the semantics of the statement as it relates to the former vice president, noting that Russia is unambiguously looking to ""denigrate"" Biden while China simply ""prefers"" a Trump defeat. Evanina came under fire from Democratic leaders last month when he last issued a warning about efforts by Russia, China and Iran to interfere in the November election. Lawmakers claimed his statement did not go ""nearly far enough"" in providing the American public with information about foreign attempts to influence the election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff on Friday said Evanina's statement improves on the last by including more detail, but ""still treats three actors of differing intent and capability as equal threats to our democratic elections."" An official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told CNN that there's ""no particular rank or order by which the threat actors are listed"" in Evanina's statement. ""Each of these adversaries poses a threat to our election and it's imperative that we all work together as a nation to combat them,"" the official told CNN in a statement Friday. The official said the assessments are the ""most current, accurate, and objective election threat information the Intelligence Community has to offer in an unclassified setting at this time."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Friday that Evanina ""makes clear"" that ""Russian malign influence efforts remain a significant threat,"" and added that it would be a ""serious mistake to ignore the growing threats posed by China and Iran."" The head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Christopher Krebs, praised the transparency of Evanina's statement — but specifically mentioned Russia and not the other countries by name. ""We have long said Russia and other nation-states are targeting our elections,"" Krebs said in a statement Friday. ""We knew this to be true in 2016, we know it's true today and we know they will continue to attempt to interfere."" In a joint statement, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sens. Marco Rubio and Mark Warner, on Friday thanked Evanina for providing the additional information about the threats and encouraged the intelligence community to ""continue to make this information available."" The two senators also called on ""political leaders on all sides to refrain from weaponizing intelligence matters for political gain, as this only furthers the divisive aims of our adversaries."" But on Friday, the Biden and Trump campaigns responded to the news of Evanina's warning by volleying attacks at one another. The Biden campaign's foreign policy adviser, Tony Blinken, accused Trump of having ""publicly and repeatedly invited, emboldened, and even tried to coerce foreign interference in American elections."" ""Joe Biden, on the other hand, has led the fight against foreign interference for years, and has refused to accept any foreign materials intended to help him in this election -- something that Donald Trump and his campaign have repeatedly failed to do,"" Blinken said. Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh claimed the Trump administration has held Moscow accountable and is ""tougher on Russia than any administration in history,"" also attacking Obama's former national security adviser Susan Rice, who is a potential running mate for Biden. ""In 2016 it was the Democrats who actively solicited help from foreign nationals in an unsuccessful effort to beat President Trump, and it wouldn't surprise anyone if Democrat operatives were once again up to no good. If anyone should face questions about foreign interference in 2020, it's Joe Biden's campaign,"" Murtaugh said. In his statement Friday, Evanina said, ""Many foreign actors have a preference for who wins the election, which they express through a range of overt and private statements; covert influence efforts are rarer."" In providing an example of Russia's attempts to ""denigrate"" Biden, Evanina accused pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach of ""spreading claims about corruption"" to undermine Biden's candidacy and the Democratic Party. Evanina also said some with ties to the Kremlin seek to boost Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian TV. And China's public rhetoric over the past few months has grown ""increasingly critical"" of the Trump administration's coronavirus response, the recent closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston and actions related to Hong Kong, among other issues, Evanina noted. ""Beijing recognizes that all of these efforts might affect the presidential race,"" Evanina said. Evanina's assessment comes two days after the release of a new report from the State Department that accused Russia of conducting a sophisticated disinformation and propaganda campaign, which uses a variety of approaches including Kremlin-aligned news sites to promote their agenda. The report focused in particular on the Russian government's use of this network to push disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic as it spread across the globe. It did not mention Russian disinformation in the context of the 2020 US presidential election, however, as it falls outside of the mandate of the Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC), which focuses on foreign propaganda and disinformation aimed at foreign audiences.

2020-08-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/politics/ncsc-director-2020-election-threat/index.html,"Intelligence community's top election official's statement warning of threats from China, Russia and Iran","The US intelligence community's top election security official said in a statement Friday that China ""prefers"" an outcome where President Donald Trump is not reelected in November and Russia is working to denigrate former Vice President Joe Biden's White House bid. Read the statement: WASHINGTON, D.C. -- On July 24, 2020, I issued a statement to the American public providing an unclassified overview of foreign threats to the 2020 election and offering basic steps to mitigate some of these threats. At that time, I pledged that the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) would continue to update the American public and other key stakeholders on the evolving election threat landscape, while also safeguarding our intelligence sources and methods. Today, we are making good on that promise by sharing additional information with the public on the intentions and activities of our adversaries with respect to the 2020 election. This information is being released for the purpose of better informing Americans so they can play a critical role in safeguarding our election. Below is the latest public update: ------------------------ Ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections, foreign states will continue to use covert and overt influence measures in their attempts to sway U.S. voters' preferences and perspectives, shift U.S. policies, increase discord in the United States, and undermine the American people's confidence in our democratic process. They may also seek to compromise our election infrastructure for a range of possible purposes, such as interfering with the voting process, stealing sensitive data, or calling into question the validity of the election results. However, it would be difficult for our adversaries to interfere with or manipulate voting results at scale. Many foreign actors have a preference for who wins the election, which they express through a range of overt and private statements; covert influence efforts are rarer. We are primarily concerned about the ongoing and potential activity by China, Russia, and Iran. CHINA -- We assess that China prefers that President Trump -- whom Beijing sees as unpredictable -- does not win reelection. China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China. Although China will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action, its public rhetoric over the past few months has grown increasingly critical of the current Administration's COVID-19 response, closure of China's Houston Consulate, and actions on other issues. For example, it has harshly criticized the Administration's statements and actions on Hong Kong, TikTok, the legal status of the South China Sea, and China's efforts to dominate the 5G market. Beijing recognizes that all of these efforts might affect the presidential race. RUSSIA -- We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia ""establishment."" This is consistent with Moscow's public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration's policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia. For example, pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption -- including through publicizing leaked phone calls -- to undermine former Vice President Biden's candidacy and the Democratic Party. Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television. IRAN -- We assess that Iran seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections. Iran's efforts along these lines probably will focus on on-line influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content. Tehran's motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump's reelection would result in a continuation of U.S. pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change. ----------------------- The intelligence assessments above represent the most current, accurate, and objective election threat information the IC has to offer in an unclassified setting at this time. Providing objective intelligence analysis is the solemn duty of the men and women of the IC, who work day and night around the world, often at great personal risk, to safeguard our nation. The IC also recognizes there will continue to be demand for more information as the election approaches. The IC has and will continue to provide classified election threat briefings to the presidential campaigns, political committees and all Members of Congress. We have provided nearly 20 classified election threat briefings to these stakeholders since mid-May 2020. We will also keep providing updates to the American public, consistent with our national security obligations. The steps we have taken thus far to inform the public and other stakeholders on election threats are unprecedented for the IC. Aside from sharing information, let me assure you that the IC is also doing everything in its power to combat both cyber and influence efforts targeting our electoral process and continues to support DHS and FBI in their critical roles safeguarding the election. As I emphasized in my July 24, 2020 public statement, we are all in this together as Americans. Our election should be our own. Foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections are a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy.

2020-08-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/03/politics/foreign-election-interference-senate/index.html,Democrats say public needs to know more on foreign election interference,"Democratic senators say the US intelligence community still needs to share more with the public about foreign efforts to interfere in the US presidential election after top Trump administration election security officials provided a classified briefing to lawmakers Monday. Senators left Monday's briefing saying they expected more information to be released to the public in the coming weeks. But Democrats argued that the public is still too much in the dark about the campaign that Russian-linked operatives are running to try to smear former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic nominee -- information they've charged is being provided to Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson as part of his investigation into Biden, his son and Ukraine. ""There's a clear narrative being perpetuated by Russia and Russia's allies. I don't know everybody that the Homeland Security is talking to, but what I know is the narrative they are working off of is the very same narrative that the Russians are trying to push domestically,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. ""So I remain very concerned about the lack of information that the public has and the damage that may do to the election."" The push for intelligence officials to say more publicly follows pointed criticism Democratic leaders issued last month over a public statement the intelligence community's top election official issued saying multiple countries were trying to interfere in the 2020 election. Democrats had demanded the FBI brief Congress on what they described as a foreign disinformation targeting the presidential election, which CNN and other media outlets have reported included concerns that Russian-linked entities were providing information about Biden to Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican. ""The (intelligence community) has a natural tendency to want to, obviously protect sources and methods, which I strongly agree with, but they always have a tendency to try to, by their nature, always want to pull things back,"" said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the four Democrats who sent the letter to the FBI. ""I think they're getting better but I think we have room for further improvement."" Johnson has denied receiving any Russian disinformation, and he's accused Democrats of running their own disinformation campaign to try to discredit his probe and protect their presidential nominee from scrutiny. Asked if his investigation came up at Monday's briefing, Johnson said no. ""There's nothing about what we're doing that affects election security,"" he added. Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, said Monday that ""there should be more information"" released to the public about Johnson's probe. ""We had a good briefing today,"" he added, declining to say if Johnson's probe was discussed. Monday's all-Senate briefings came after House members were briefed by election security officials on Friday, in which CNN reported intelligence officials discounted the possibility of foreign countries mass producing fake ballots, contradicting President Donald Trump's continued insistence that mail-in voting poses a significant threat to election security. Acting Senate Intelligence Chairman Marco Rubio defended the intelligence community, saying it would be putting out more information about election security threats as the election neared. ""On a regular basis now, you're going to see notifications and things coming out from the director of national intelligence and those who work for him,"" said Rubio. ""I don't know how anyone can leave any of these briefings that we've had around here with the notion that our career intelligence professionals are in any way deliberately trying to keep things from the American people,"" the Florida Republican added when asked if the briefing should satisfy Democrats' concerns. Senate Democrats largely praised Monday's classified briefings -- which included Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, and Bill Evanina, the career intelligence official who issued the statement Democrats slammed that Russia, China and Iran were seeking to interfere in 2020 -- even as they said more needed to be released publicly. Asked as he was leaving the Capitol if Russian disinformation was discussed Monday, Ratcliffe said ""classified briefing"" and did not elaborate. Democrats said they received useful information from the briefers, which included officials from across the federal government dealing with election security. ""I think that our intelligence agencies are working hard on this, and more information will be forthcoming,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat. ""We got some important information, but I believe there's more to come."" ""It was helpful,"" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, noting that it underscored the need for states to receive election funding. ""I think the public should learn much more, and I hope that will come out.""",20,0.9803990302075798,0.5672943007741122,0.41310472943346754,14
2020-07-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/21/politics/joe-biden-russia-foreign-interference/index.html,Democrats raise concerns over Russian-linked campaign targeting Biden,"Congressional Democrats' request to the FBI to brief lawmakers on foreign election interference included concerns about a Russian-linked ""disinformation"" campaign to target former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, according to a source familiar with the matter. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence committees sent FBI Director Chris Wray a letter last week urging a briefing for all lawmakers on a foreign interference campaign that ""seeks to launder and amplify disinformation."" The lawmakers did not detail specifics in the letter to Wray, which was released publicly on Monday. But a classified addendum sent to the FBI included concerns about a potential Russian campaign targeting Biden, the source said, including that information from entities with ties to Russia was being provided to Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, who is leading an investigation into Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Ukrainian energy firm Burisma. The material the Democrats referenced was included in warnings that the FBI has been offering for months now about election interference, another source said. The Democrats' letter comes as the 2020 campaign between Biden and President Donald Trump is heating up and Democrats on guard for a repeat of 2016, when Russia interfered in the presidential election to benefit Trump. Shortly after the Democrats' released their letter Monday, Biden's campaign issued a statement saying if elected, he would ""treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation's government."" Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Democrats did not reach out to their Republican counterparts to sign onto the letter, according to a source. Acting Senate Intelligence Chairman Marco Rubio said Tuesday he was not asked to join it. Politico first reported Democrats' concerns about Russia and Johnson's committee. Johnson told reporters Tuesday he wasn't aware of any Russia disinformation sent to his committee, but said that his staff vets any evidence the panel is provided and takes anything coming from Ukraine with a ""huge grain of salt."" ""I'm not aware of every piece of information our committee has gathered. We're encouraging people to send us information, but then we fully vet it,"" Johnson said. ""We take everything with a grain of salt we get from Ukraine. I think you have to."" Johnson charged that it was Democrats who were peddling Russian disinformation through the opposition research dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, pointing to recently declassified footnotes that showed the intelligence community raised concerns in 2017 Steele's dossier could have included Russian disinformation. ""We're being accused of being used as a tool of Russia. The tool of Russian disinformation was in the Steele report,"" he said. Johnson spokesman Austin Altenburg said that claims Russian disinformation had been provided to the committee were false. He said committee staff had been briefed by the FBI on the issue and that Johnson had requested a member briefing too. ""It does a disservice to our election security efforts when Democrats use the threat of Russian disinformation as a weapon to cast doubt on investigations they don't like but are silent when recently declassified intelligence revealed that Democrat-funded opposition research on the Trump campaign contained actual Russian disinformation,"" Altenburg said. In recent months, a small group of Ukrainian political figures has injected themselves into the 2020 US presidential election by releasing and promoting alleged audiotapes of Biden. Some of these figures are connected to Kremlin interests or to Russian intelligence agencies, which experts say suggests their actions may be part of a Russian-backed misinformation campaign. The recordings are of Biden's dealings with former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and they appear authentic. But the material reinforces Biden's claims that he promoted US interests and didn't do anything improper in Ukraine. There is no proof of wrongdoing on the tapes, and the Biden campaign maintains that these releases are blatant Russian meddling against Biden. Some Republicans and right-wing news outlets have embraced the baseless claims being levied by these controversial Ukrainian figures. Some of these figures, including Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach, have worked closely with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Johnson has tried to secure testimony from another Ukrainian in this orbit, former diplomat Andrii Telizhenko. Many of these false narratives played a central role in Trump's impeachment proceedings. At that time, Fiona Hill, who was Trump's top adviser on Russia, testified that some Republicans were promoting a ""fictional narrative"" that was concocted by Russian intelligence agencies, and were thus peddling ""politically derivative falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests."" Publicly, Democrats were vague about their concerns on Tuesday, while reiterating their desire for all lawmakers to hear from the FBI. ""I'm concerned about all the members of Congress and everyone being targeted by a foreign country,"" Pelosi told CNN when asked if she was specifically concerned about an effort targeting Biden. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN the FBI was still ""considering"" the request for a briefing, but had not yet made a final decision. He argued it was important for lawmakers to hear from the FBI directly. ""There may be ways for us to disseminate the information among our members in terms of what the committee possesses, but regardless, I think it would be advantageous for the director of the FBI to come and brief all the members so they can answer questions,"" Schiff said. Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of the letter Monday: ""I've been raising concerns about election security for months on end, and I think it's very important that all senators be briefed ... I've had these concerns virtually since the end of the '18 cycle."" On CNN's ""New Day"" Tuesday, Schumer said that a ""lot of countries"" were trying to interfere, adding, ""we have to be prepared."" US officials have been warning about interference from a number of countries, including Russia. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the top official at both the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command, said Monday the US is seeing a ""rise in capacity"" and ""capability"" of cyber programs from foreign adversaries, including Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. ""Our No. 1 goal, our No. 1 objective at the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command, is a safe, secure and legitimate 2020 elections,"" Nakasone added. Rubio declined to comment specifically on the letter, while noting that foreign election interference continues to be a problem. ""We should expect that multiple counties will try to conduct informational warfare and influence campaign, policy, public discourse, for the foreseeable future,"" he said. ""It's not a new problem but it's a growing one.""",20,0.7982297666068431,1.0438491641374013,-0.24561939753055817,14
2020-07-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/10/politics/donald-trump-us-russia-cyberattack/index.html,Trump confirms US conducted cyberattack against Russia in 2018,"President Donald Trump, for the first time, confirmed the US conducted a covert cyberattack in 2018 against Russia's Internet Research Agency. The Internet Research Agency is a troll farm blamed by the US for helping to facilitate interference both in the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterms. Trump gave the confirmation during an interview conducted by Marc Thiessen, a Washington Post columnist and former speechwriter for President George W. Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Thiessen writes in the Post that during his interview he asked Trump whether he had launched a cyberattack. Thiessen said Trump replied, ""Correct."" Trump said during the interview that in 2016, then-President Barack Obama ""knew before the election that Russia was playing around. Or, he was told. Whether or not it was so or not, who knows? And he said nothing. And the reason he said nothing was that he didn't want to touch it because he thought (Hillary Clinton) was winning because he read phony polls. So, he thought she was going to win. And we had the silent majority that said, 'No, we like Trump.' "" Trump claimed that unlike his predecessor, he acted on intelligence the US had about Russia's election interference by launching the cyberattack. ""Look, we stopped it,"" Trump told Thiessen. Obama in December 2016 did announce sanctions against Russia and expelled some Russian diplomats in retaliation for Russia's interference in the US presidential election. The Washington Post in October 2018 previously reported there was a cyberattack. The operation against the company, which is bankrolled by an oligarch close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was carried out in order to prevent any interference in the midterms, the paper was told. This is, however, the first official confirmation from Trump. Thiessen reports senior US officials also confirmed that the strike occurred and was effective, taking the Internet Research Agency offline. In the interview, Trump said the cyberattack was part of a broader policy to confront Russia. ""Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,"" the President told Thiessen, a contention he has made repeatedly in the past. Among the examples he gave was the US sending antitank busters to Ukraine. As CNN previously reported, Trump appeared to confirm that the US had conducted such a cyberattack against a Russian entity during the 2018 midterm elections in a June 2019 Fox News interview. ""I would rather not say that, but you can believe that the whole thing happened, and it happened during my administration,"" Trump told Fox News' Steve Hilton when asked about a report that he personally authorized a cyberattack on Russia during the time of the midterms. When pressed as to why he didn't talk about it, Trump said ""because they don't like me to talk, intelligence says, 'please don't talk intelligence,' you know sometimes intelligence is good, and sometimes you look at (James) Comey, and you look at (John) Brennan and you look at (James) Clapper, and I'm supposed to believe that intelligence? I never believe that intelligence."" CNN's Barbara Starr also reported in October 2018 that the US military's Cyber Command had begun targeting Russian operatives believed to be attempting to influence the 2018 midterm elections as part of a broad effort in coordination with several government agencies, an administration official confirmed to CNN.",20,1.3066882768658539,1.2753899355210574,0.031298341344796476,14
2020-07-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/30/world/meanwhile-in-america-june-30-intl/index.html,"Europe, bid au revoir to American tourists","The Canadians will be in Europe this summer, and the Thais and the Moroccans. You might bump into a Rwandan, and no doubt Aussie backpackers will give it a go. If Beijing reciprocates on border openings, Chinese travelers could be on their way, too. But if you live in the European Union, you probably won't be running into American tourists. The bloc is expected to agree on Tuesday that Yanks will be barred from its member states as the US fights a Covid-19 resurgence. The move will highlight the failed US effort to suppress the coronavirus pandemic: Charts of new confirmed coronavirus cases on each side of the Atlantic are moving in exactly the opposite direction. Europe's openings could still have the same painful effect that they did in states like Florida, Texas and Arizona. But European states generally imposed earlier, tighter lockdowns than in the US, and mask wearing is not the polarized issue it is here. If it comes, the EU ruling will be another personal embarrassment to President Donald Trump over his botched management of the pandemic. The President often explodes at perceived slights. But since he's pretty much ignoring the Covid-19 crisis in the US, he might let this one slide. Plus, as the White House has already pointed out, European entry into the US is already suspended. No-shows by US tourists will hurt the shuttered European tourism industry. Millions bring their dollars across the Atlantic every year, drawn by the continent's history, cuisine and ambience. Italy, France, Germany and Spain welcome the most Americans, according to EU data. But until the two-way flow between the Old and New Worlds is restored, the murmur of admiring visitors in Europe's cathedrals and museums will be missing that certain je ne sais quoi of the overheard American twang. See you next year, hopefully. 'Oh my God, don't make that phone call' What has Trump learned of statecraft, after hundreds of ""highly classified"" phone calls and negotiations with foreign leaders? Not much, according to months of reporting for CNN by veteran Washington reporter Carl Bernstein, whose sources in government say there's little evidence that Trump has become more competent with practice. Rather, staffers say the President still refuses to read briefings before calls, boosts himself personally to strongmen like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and insults female leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel as ""stupid"" and weak. Among the revelations: Erdogan's timing for calls was so perfect that some staffers wondered if he had access to Trump's personal schedule. And Trump's haranguing of Merkel was ""so unusual"" that special measures had to be taken in Berlin to ensure that the calls' specific contents remained secret, according to a German official. No wonder staffers grit their teeth when the President's fingers head for the phone. Spies who love the spotlight For an intelligence service that is supposed to operate in the shadows, Russia's GRU seems to attract a lot of headlines. The GRU -- formally known as Main Directorate of the General Staff -- has long been accused by the West of orchestrating brazen and high-profile attacks, including the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts during the 2016 US presidential election and the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England. Now the spy agency is again at the center of international attention, after reports that US intelligence concluded GRU operatives offered cash incentives to the Taliban to kill American and British troops in Afghanistan. But strangely, the alleged operation could potentially conflict with Russia's own stated goal to bring warring parties to the table in Afghanistan. Russia has cultivated contacts with the Taliban and other warring parties in Afghanistan as a way to influence outcomes in a region it considers its strategic backyard. ""It's long been known that there were Russian contacts with the Taliban and at minimum some greasing of the relationship with benefits as a hedging technique,"" says Laurel Miller, program director for Asia with International Crisis Group. However, she added, an operation to put bounties on US troops would be far more provocative and a ""different thing"" from its typical behavior. ""It conflicts with what Russian official policy is,"" she said. In other words, the alleged GRU operation targeting US and coalition troops could have blowback: potentially undermining US support for withdrawal, or perhaps prompting fresh sanctions on Russia. Yet the agency has a reputation for brazenness -- and has operated seemingly opportunistically or independently of official policy before. Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, points out that the GRU does aggressively pursue operations that cause diplomatic fallout. Intelligence experts say the Salisbury poisoning -- which led to the investigative outlet Bellingcat unmasking the alleged GRU operatives through open-source research -- showed a pattern recklessness and overt brutality, rather than a secretive approach to spycraft. And that sent a message to the GRU's enemies. ""That was a pattern we've seen many times in Ukraine,"" Weiss said, referring to Russian intelligence activities there. ""The Kremlin is hardly a well-oiled machine, but time and again, Putin -- either by denying blatant Russian misdeeds or throwing a safety blanket over his security establishment -- does little to improve Russia's international image."" -- CNN's Nathan Hodge writes to Meanwhile from London Trump says he was never briefed about the GRU's alleged bounty scheme. Asked about that by CNN's Jake Tapper, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded, ""If they had this intelligence, they should have briefed the President. Why didn't they? Because they know it makes him very unhappy, and all roads for him lead to Putin"" -- a phrase she's used before about Trump's Ukraine and Russian election interference scandals. In fact, intelligence about the apparent plot did appear in one of Trump's daily briefs early this year, a US official with direct knowledge also told CNN on Monday -- and that it was considered serious enough that the National Security Council staff met to discuss ""possible response options,"" including sanctions, if the intelligence developed. 'If I could build a wall around us...I would' Trump's not the only US leader itching to build a wall. In light of a massive resurgence in coronavirus cases across the United States, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said Monday that he wouldn't mind a wall just for his region. ""We have lived through hell in this state to get to where we are,"" he said, referring to New Jersey's battle with Covid-19. ""Frankly, I'd never thought I'd say these words, but if I could build a wall around us or around our region I would. But we can't, so we have to rely on personal responsibility and the right behavior, the common sense for the common good."" Out-of-state visitors must now quarantine for 14 days after arriving in New Jersey.",20,3.0590134637529287,1.4287656340890642,1.6302478296638645,29
2020-06-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/politics/trump-mcenany-briefing-russia-bounty/index.html,White House briefing on Russia bounty reports raises more questions than it answers about Trump and US intelligence,"White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany addressed a flurry of questions on Monday about President Donald Trump's head-scratching response to recent news reports that the Russian government paid bounties to Afghan militants who killed American troops. Many of these reports said Trump and the White House have known about the bounties for months but haven't condemned them publicly or taken any retaliatory steps against Moscow. McEnany said at a news conference on Monday that Trump hasn't ever been briefed about the situation, even after the story broke over the weekend, while the President was golfing in Virginia. McEnany repeatedly tried to undermine and discredit the bombshell story, which was first reported by The New York Times. Its story was quickly corroborated and expanded upon by CNN, The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. A handful of overseas news outlets also reported that US officials had briefed the United Kingdom about the threat to British troops. But while making her case, McEnany appeared to contradict Trump on two key points, and also offered explanations about intelligence-gathering that didn't make sense to seasoned experts. Did Trump know? In a Twitter post Sunday night, Trump said, ""Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or (Vice President Mike Pence)."" The post appeared to confirm that Trump had spoken with US intelligence officials and they reported to him that they had determined that the allegations about Russian bounties were not credible. But McEnany said Monday that Trump ""has not been briefed on this matter."" Her denial raised immediate questions, considering reports that US officials had briefed their British counterparts. She also said the US government is still determining the veracity of the underlying intelligence, which undercuts Trump's suggestion that US intelligence agencies had already deemed it unreliable. ""There is no consensus within the intelligence community on these allegations,"" McEnany said, a phrase that she repeated multiple times during her news conference. ""In fact, there are dissenting opinions from some in the intelligence community with regard to the veracity of what's being reported. And the veracity of the underlying allegations continue to be evaluated."" McEnany did not outright deny the underlying allegations against Russia, but repeatedly tried to cast doubt about the information. She criticized the news organizations that published the articles and said several times that there was ""no consensus"" among US intelligence agencies. Experts balk Her efforts drew some quick rebukes from national security and intelligence experts on Twitter. ""This smells like the WH trying to mislead the public,"" said CNN national security analyst Susan Hennessey, who has been a sharp critic of the Trump administration. ""It is common for different intel agencies to attach different degrees of confidence based on the manner on underlying intel; that isn't the same as there being disagreement over whether something happened."" National security experts also balked at McEnany's assertion that intelligence about such a sensitive matter would ""not be elevated to the President until it was verified."" The point of these briefings, experts say, is to keep the president abreast of new intelligence and insights, which can be fast-changing, so briefings include assessments about the credibility of the information. The New York Times has reported that Trump typically doesn't read the President's Daily Brief, a highly classified intelligence report prepared for the President each day. On Monday, McEnany declined to say if the intelligence about Russia had ever been included in a President's Daily Brief that was prepared for Trump. McEnany later said, ""This President has been extremely strong on Russia,"" pointing to economic sanctions and Trump's withdrawal from an arms treaty. But this cherry-picked narrative ignores dozens of other actions and comments by Trump where he has gone out of his way to praise Russian President Vladimir Putin or roll back punitive measures against the Kremlin. Several hours after the briefing, CNN reported that intelligence about the Russian bounty plot was included in one of the President's Daily Briefs prepared for Trump sometime in the spring of this year, according to a US official with direct knowledge of the latest information. The official said the intelligence was backed up by ""several pieces of information."" It's unclear if Trump ever read this particular President's Daily Brief. Throughout her news conference, McEnany spent more time criticizing American journalists than condemning Russia for its aggressive moves against US interests, which includes the bounties in Afghanistan, election interference in 2016, and military actions in Syria and Ukraine. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the name of the President's Daily Brief. It also has been updated with additional reporting.",20,1.3015853154950057,2.887075225675062,-1.5854899101800564,19
2020-06-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/europe/russia-afghanistan-gru-analysis-intl/index.html,Russia's GRU: Spy agency known for brazenness back in the headlines,"For an intelligence service that is supposed to operate in the shadows, the GRU seems to attract a lot of headlines. The GRU -- formally known as Main Directorate of the General Staff -- has long been accused by the West of orchestrating brazen and high-profile attacks, including the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts during the 2016 US presidential election and the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England. Now the spy agency is again at the center of international attention, after reports that US intelligence concluded GRU operatives offered cash incentives to the Taliban to kill American and British troops in Afghanistan. The news has already caused a political storm in Washington, with congressional leaders demanding answers from the Trump administration. But observers also wonder why the Russian intelligence agency would run an operation that potentially conflicts with Russia's own stated goals to bring warring parties to the table in Afghanistan and avoid a precipitous collapse of the central government. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the story -- first reported by the New York Times -- was a ""hoax,"" echoing President Donald Trump's suggestion that the reported intelligence may be ""phony"" and the story false. ""First of all, these assertions are a lie,"" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. ""Secondly, if the US special services still report to the president, then I suggest [you] proceed from the corresponding statements of President Trump, who has already given his assessment to these reports."" One can be forgiven for having a sense of déjà vu: The denials about GRU always come swiftly from the Russian government. In March 2018, then UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was ""highly likely"" responsible for the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury -- and that the two suspects in the attack were believed to be officers of the GRU. That July, the US Special Prosecutor's office indicted 12 GRU officers for their alleged involvement in the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts as part of a larger, Kremlin-directed effort to interfere in the 2016 US election campaign. The Kremlin repeatedly denied involvement in both cases, although Russian President Vladimir Putin called Skripal a ""traitor"" and a ""scumbag"" and suggested that the leak of the Democratic Party emails was not necessarily a bad thing. ""Some hackers published information about the unseemly conduct of Ms. [Hillary] Clinton's campaign headquarters -- supporting one candidate for the party nomination at the expense of the other,"" he said. ""Everyone is talking about who did it, but is it so important who did it? What is important is the content of this information. That's my answer."" Now, allegations that the GRU offered bounties to Taliban fighters to kill US troops come at a sensitive time: Russia -- which considers Afghanistan a near-neighbor -- want American troops out of the country. In late February, the US and the Taliban inked a peace deal that paves the way for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and peace talks between the militant group and the government. While relations between the US and Russia are fraught, the two countries have some common ground on Afghanistan: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova, usually a staunch critic of US foreign policy, recently praised US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad for his ""proactive efforts"" to broker peace in Afghanistan. And Russia has made its own efforts to shape outcomes in Afghanistan, bringing representatives of the Taliban and some of Afghanistan's most prominent political players to Moscow. An alleged GRU operation targeting US and coalition soldiers would appear to be at odds with those Russian diplomatic initiatives, says Laurel Miller, program director for Asia with International Crisis Group. Russia has cultivated contacts with both the Taliban and other warring parties in Afghanistan as a way to influence outcomes in a region it considers its strategic backyard. ""It's long been known that there were Russian contacts with the Taliban and at minimum some greasing of the relationship with benefits as a hedging technique,"" Miller said. Back in 2017, for instance, Army Gen. John Nicholson, the top US commander said publicly Russia was sending weapons to the Taliban via neighboring Tajikistan. However, she said that an operation to put bounties on US troops would be far more provocative and a ""different thing"" from its typical behavior. ""It conflicts with what Russian official policy is,"" she said. In other words, the alleged GRU operation targeting US and coalition troops could have blowback: potentially undermining US support for withdrawal, or perhaps prompting fresh sanctions on Russia. But the agency does have a reputation for brazenness -- and can operate seemingly opportunistically or independently of official policy. Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, points out that the GRU does aggressively pursue operations that cause diplomatic fallout. Intelligence experts say the Salisbury poisoning -- which led to the investigative outlet Bellingcat unmasking the alleged GRU operatives through open-source research -- showed a pattern recklessness and overt brutality, rather than a secretive approach to spycraft, that sent a message to the GRU's enemies. ""That was a pattern we've seen many times in Ukraine,"" he said, referring to Russian intelligence activities there. ""The Kremlin is hardly a well-oiled machine, but time and again, Putin -- either by denying blatant Russian misdeeds or throwing a safety blanket over his security establishment -- does little to improve Russia's international image."" And Putin has shown consistent willingness to give political cover to the GRU. Just a few months after the Salisbury poisonings, which prompted the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats from the West, Putin took part in a gala event to celebrate the centenary of what he called the ""legendary GRU"" and praised the patriotism of its officers, who work for an organization that no longer has ""intelligence"" in its name. ""It is unclear where the name Main Intelligence Directorate has gone,"" he said. ""We ought to restore it.""",20,1.4168395180442594,4.717463452952744,-3.3006239349084847,29
2020-06-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/politics/pentagon-ukraine-security-assistance/index.html,Pentagon announces $250 million in security assistance to Ukraine,"The Pentagon has officially confirmed it is moving forward with a $250 million security assistance package to Ukraine, half of which was contingent on Kiev making progress on reforms and anti-corruption efforts. ""The Department of Defense announced today its plans for $250 million in Fiscal Year 2020 Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funds for additional training, equipment, and advisory efforts to strengthen Ukraine's capacity to more effectively defend itself against Russian aggression,"" the Pentagon said in a statement to CNN. The statement said that the ""funds -- $125 million of which was conditional on Ukraine's progress on defense reforms -- will provide equipment to support ongoing training programs and operational needs."" ""These security cooperation programs are made possible by Ukraine's continued progress on key defense institutional and anticorruption reforms,"" the statement added. CNN reported last month that the Pentagon had certified to Congress that Ukraine has made the necessary reforms to justify the additional funding and that the aid package included mobile radar systems designed to detect and track incoming artillery and rocket fire, dozens of ambulances, secure communications equipment, including 100 ""tactical tablets"" and the patrol boats armed with remote controlled 30mm cannons. Congress was not expected to block the package given the broad bipartisan support for arming Ukraine. The Pentagon statement Thursday added that the package ""reaffirms the long-standing defense relationship between the United States and Ukraine -- a critical partner on the front line of strategic competition with Russia. The United States remains steadfast in its support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders."" The Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative was thrust into the spotlight after the Trump administration froze security assistance to Ukraine after it was notified to Congress, an action that led the House of Representatives to impeach President Donald Trump. The White House has offered shifting and vague accounts of why the hold was implemented and what triggered Trump to ultimately change course and release the money. Trump administration officials at times cited corruption in Ukraine as justification for freezing the aid, though that justification was undermined by the Pentagon's certification at the time that Kiev was making progress in combating corruption. The official who provided that certification, John Rood, then the Pentagon's under secretary of defense for policy, was ousted shortly after Trump's acquittal impeachment vote. The nonpartisan congressional watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, conducted a review which found that the Trump administration broke the law when it withheld US security aid to Ukraine last year that had been appropriated by Congress. The GAO said that the White House budget office violated the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the White House from withholding funds that Congress has appropriated. Russia seized and annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and tensions between Kiev and Moscow in the region remain high. The US has long accused Moscow of arming, backing and even directing separatist fighters in the country's east in addition to annexing the Crimea peninsula. The counter artillery radars will enable Ukrainian troops to detect where enemy fire is coming from, a major concern given the ongoing exchanges of fire along the conflict's frontlines. The Pentagon's supplying of armed patrol boats are seen as important given Ukraine's tensions with Russia in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. In 2018, Russian forces seized three Ukrainian vessels and captured 24 Ukrainian sailors following a clash in the Kerch Strait which connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov and is the sole access route for ships travelling to Ukraine's eastern port cities. The Sea of Azov is much too shallow for most conventional warships to operate, making it the ideal environment for the type of patrol the US is supplying to Ukraine.",49,5.967917150014259,6.247229001071377,-0.279311851057118,8
2020-05-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/05/politics/john-ratcliffe-confirmation-hearing/index.html,Trump's spy chief pick grilled over claims intel shows coronavirus originated in Chinese lab,"President Donald Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, Rep. John Ratcliffe, was grilled Tuesday by senators over his views about the intelligence community's investigation into the origins of coronavirus in China, Russian election interference and the Trump administration's treatment of whistleblowers. In the Senate's first hearing under new social distancing guidelines, Ratcliffe walked a fine line before the Senate Intelligence Committee between pledging to be unbiased with the intelligence delivered to the President and not wading too deeply into the controversies surrounding Trump and the intelligence community. The Texas Republican faced questions from both Democrats and Republicans on whether he would provide intelligence to a President who might not want to hear it, as Trump's open disdain for the intelligence community and firing of top officials loomed over the proceeding. Trump selected Ratcliffe, who was a loyal and vocal defender of the President during impeachment, for the role for a second time in the span of a year following his initial withdrawal from consideration last summer amid questions about Ratcliffe's partisan record and exaggerations to his resume. ""Whether you are talking about the President, whether you are talking about Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell -- anyone's views on what they want the intelligence to be will never impact the intelligence that I deliver. Never,"" Ratcliffe said in response to a question from Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a key Republican on the panel. If confirmed as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe would lead the 17 agencies that make up the intelligence community as head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which was created in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Ratcliffe has been prepping for Tuesday's confirmation hearing at ODNI and has met with agency heads to get their perspectives. Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said after the hearing that he believed Ratcliffe demonstrated he would ""serve in an independent capacity."" Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, said he hoped the committee would vote to approve his nomination as soon as next week. But Democrats said they still had reservations that Ratcliffe could maintain independence from the President. ""So many members asked him basically the same question, and he gave carefully crafted answers, not answers that at least left me with the notion that he's going to protect the community that's currently under assault,"" said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel's top Democrat. 'All roads lead to China' Ratcliffe said his primary focus for the intelligence community would be on the impact of coronavirus around the world, as well as questions about its origins in Wuhan, China. ""If confirmed, the intelligence community will be laser-focused on getting all of the answers that we can regarding how this happened, when this happened, and I commit to providing with as much transparency to you as the law will allow and with due regard for sources and methods,"" Ratcliffe said. Ratcliffe said that he views China as the ""greatest threat actor"" to the United States right now, citing China's role in the coronavirus outbreak along with cybersecurity and technology issues. ""All roads lead to China,"" he said. Ratcliffe faced questions from senators in both parties about the virus' origins, which has become a politically charged issue after Trump said he had seen evidence giving him a ""high degree of confidence"" the virus originated in a lab. Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, asked Ratcliffe if he'd seen evidence it originated in a lab. He said he had not. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, then asked Ratcliffe if he'd seen evidence the virus originated in a Wuhan market. He also said he had not. CNN reported Monday that intelligence shared among Five Eyes nations indicates it is ""highly unlikely"" that the coronavirus outbreak was spread as a result of an accident in a laboratory but rather originated in a Chinese market, according to two Western officials who cited the intelligence assessment. Ratcliffe noted Tuesday, however, that it had ""been a while"" since he'd received a classified coronavirus briefing as a member of the House Intelligence Committee because Congress has been out of session due to coronavirus. King said that he raised the issue because he was concerned about ""conclusion shopping"" with the intelligence community. ""That's where it worries me that the President apparently has been pressing the intelligence community to find what he wants to find,"" King said. ""The question should be, 'Where did the virus come from?' not 'Don't you think it came from a lab?' ... Because if they taint the intelligence before it gets to them, they're going to make bad decisions."" Ratcliffe responded that he shared King's sentiment generally on the politicization of intelligence. ""I can't comment on things that haven't happened yet ... I think I've been very clear, what anyone wants the intelligence to say, wont impact the intelligence from me, what I deliver,"" Ratcliffe said. Ratcliffe steers clear of Trump intel controversies But Ratcliffe declined to weigh in on several of Trump's controversies with the intelligence community, from the President's unwillingness to accept the finding that Russia was trying to help him in the 2016 election to the firing of several senior intelligence officials, including former IC inspector general Michael Atkinson, who notified Congress of the Ukraine whistleblower complaint that ultimately sparked Trump's impeachment. Asked about the firing, Ratcliffe said he wasn't familiar enough with the Justice Department's legal opinion on whether the whistleblower complaint met the legal requirement for notifying Congress. ""That's a legal question that I don't know the answer to,"" Ratcliffe said. And Ratcliffe declined to answer a question from Warner about whether he agreed with the Senate Intelligence Committee's report that corroborated the intelligence community assessment Russia was trying to help Trump in 2017, when the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee disputed that finding in 2018. ""I respect both committees, but I have not seen the underlying intelligence to tell me why there is a difference of opinion between the two committees,"" Ratcliffe said. Ratcliffe looks to have the support he needs from Republicans who were skeptical the first time he was picked, but Democrats pressed him Tuesday on his ability to be independent from Trump's open distrust of the intelligence community. Ratcliffe would be replacing US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, a fierce loyalist to the President who was named acting director of national intelligence in February following ouster of Joseph Maguire. Grenell has butted heads with Congress since taking over the role. Warner said he had concerns about what he described as Ratcliffe's ""inexperience, partisanship, and past statements that seemed to embellish"" his record. ""Some have suggested that your main qualification for confirmation to this post is that you are not Ambassador Grenell. But frankly, that is not enough,"" Warner said in his opening statement. Ratcliffe pledged in his opening statement to deliver unbiased intelligence to the President and Congress. ""Let me be very clear. Regardless of what anyone wants our intelligence to reflect, the intelligence I will provide, if confirmed, will not be impacted or altered as a result of outside influence,"" Ratcliffe said in the opening statement. First Senate hearing with social distancing Ratcliffe's confirmation hearing is the first Senate hearing being held since the chamber reconvened this week in a new, socially distant world at the US Capitol. The hearing was closed to the public, the number of aides and reporters were limited and senators rotated into the hearing in small groups for half-hour blocks. Normally, the hearing room would have upward of 100 people for a high-profile confirmation, but just around two dozen were present Tuesday morning when Burr gaveled into session. A nominee's family members, for instance, nearly always attend confirmation hearings, but Ratcliffe's had to watch remotely on Tuesday. Ratcliffe was supposed to be introduced by a former attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, John Ashcroft. Instead, Senate Intelligence member Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, read excerpts of Ashcroft's planned statement. Burr, who was cool to Ratcliffe's nomination last year, said in March when Ratcliffe was re-nominated that he would support the pick. In a sign of the bipartisan concern about Trump's treatment of intelligence officials and the firing of Atkinson, Burr's first question was about the importance of the intelligence community's inspector general. Democrats questioned Ratcliffe on both his past statements as well as the President's. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet asked Ratcliffe if he agreed with the President saying that he selected the Texas Republican because the intelligence agencies had ""run amok."" ""I don't think that the men and women of the intelligence community are running amok,"" Ratcliffe said. Asked if he thought the President's comments harmed intelligence community morale, Ratcliffe said: ""I hope not."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, presented Ratcliffe with his statements made during the House's impeachment hearings last year on the Ukraine whistleblower, who came under attack by the President and his allies in Congress. Ratcliffe responded that he didn't want to ""relitigate"" the impeachment inquiry. ""My issue was not with the whistleblower, my issue was with what I saw as a lack of due process in the House process,"" he said. Ratcliffe was later pressed by Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, to commit unequivocally to submit credible whistleblower complaints to Congress, a question stemming from the fight over the Ukraine whistleblower report last year. ""You want to have it both ways,"" Wyden said after Ratcliffe said he would follow the law. ""You want to try to portray yourself as a defender of the Constitution and then you water it down with the specifics."" Ratcliffe committed at Tuesday's hearing to holding the annual World Wide Threats hearing, an annual assessment by the intelligence community that has previously been marked by public testimony from top officials but had not yet been scheduled for this year. CNN reported in January that US intelligence officials quietly asked the Senate and House Intelligence committees not to hold public hearings on this year's assessment after testimony from agency chiefs last year prompted an angry response from Trump, according to a source familiar with the talks. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",20,3.560416835935264,1.316544982323768,2.243871853611496,5
2020-04-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/22/politics/senate-intelligence-committee-donald-trump-russia/index.html,The Senate just proved Donald Trump wrong -- again -- on Russian interference in 2016,"On Tuesday, something very, very important happened on Capitol Hill. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is chaired by Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, released its long-awaited 156-page report detailing its investigation into allegations that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election. And what did their investigation find? That Russia engaged in a deep and broad effort to influence the outcome of the 2016 race, aiming to help Donald Trump win. ""The Committee found no reason to dispute the Intelligence Community's conclusions,"" said Burr in a statement on his committee's findings. Which now means that the following committees and communities have concluded the exact same thing about Russia's attempted interference in the last presidential election: * The intelligence community * Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation * The Senate Intelligence Committee President Trump sent 19 tweets (and retweets) on Tuesday, but not a single one addressed the Senate Intelligence Committee's findings. Which might be understandable given the fact that Trump is leading the effort to battle the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. But he did make time to tweet out an endorsement of a new book by former ICE director Tom Homan, so ... And to be honest, Trump has made his feelings about the proof that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help him very, very clear. He's, um, skeptical. ""95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, 53% overall,"" he tweeted last month. ""Not bad considering I get nothing but Fake & Corrupt News, day and night. 'Russia, Russia, Russia', then 'the Ukraine Scam (where's the Whistleblower?)', the 'Impeachment Hoax', and more, more, more...."" Just after the Iowa caucuses in February failed to produce an immediate winner on the Democratic side, Trump tweeted this: ""I think they should blame RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA again! If they can't count votes properly, how are they going to run U.S. HealthCare?"" And let's not forget that Trump, standing side-by-side with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in 2018, said this about Russian interference: ""I hold both countries responsible. I think that the United States has been foolish. I think we've all been foolish. ... And I think we're all to blame."" And then he said this: ""So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today."" So, yeah. Here's the thing that the Senate Intelligence Committee report should drive home for Trump -- and everyone else: it is now entirely and completely beyond dispute that Russia sought to interfere in the last presidential election to help Trump and hurt Clinton. In order to not believe that, you have to accept that the entire intelligence community, Mueller and his entire team and the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee are ALL in on some sort of elaborate and incredibly well-coordinated scheme to deceive the American public because, uh, they all don't like Trump or something? It's fanciful. It's a conspiracy theory without even any nuggets of fact. Why, then, is the President of the United States not convinced? Simple: Because he has never been able to hold these two ideas in his mind at the same time: 1) Russia meddled in the election to help him and 2) He's President anyway. Go all the way back to Helsinki. Here's what Trump said back then about the allegations: ""That was a clean campaign. I beat Hillary Clinton easily. And, frankly, we beat her -- and I'm not even saying from the standpoint -- we won that race. ... We ran a brilliant campaign, and that's why I'm President."" In Trump's mind, acknowledging the fact -- and yes, it is a fact -- that Russia tried to help him win somehow robs him of the credit for winning that he obviously thinks he so richly deserves. I did this, not Russia, Trump is essentially saying. I get the credit. Not them. Me. Me! It's, of course, obvious to anyone paying attention that both things can be true: Russia tried to interfere in the election and Trump ran a great race. Elections are very rarely won by a single factor alone. Luck, skill, your strengths, your opponent's weaknesses, uncontrollable outside events -- all of these things go into who wins and who loses. In 2016 and every other election. Trump's blindness to the Russia reality isn't just a chapter for the history books either. Because we know Russia viewed its involvement in the 2016 race as a success and are hungry to create more chaos this November. ""We assess that foreign actors will view the 2020 US elections as an opportunity to advance their interests,"" then Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told Congress in 2019. ""We expect them to refine their capabilities and add new tactics as they learn from each other's experiences and efforts in previous elections."" All of which means that the President's unwillingness to accept the FACT that Russia interfered once and they will do it again makes it much more likely that we won't be properly prepared for what's coming over the 195 days between now and November 3.",20,2.3183836081549103,0.8698480946664815,1.4485355134884288,6
2020-02-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/politics/russia-election-threat-intelligence-briefing-controversy/index.html,FBI official warns Russia 'wants to watch us tear ourselves apart' amid intel briefing controversy,"Russia's influence campaign is driven by a desire to ""watch us tear ourselves apart,"" a senior FBI official said Monday, comments that come after details of a classified briefing to lawmakers became public in news reports, including a claim by the intelligence community's top election security official that Moscow is interfering with the goal of helping President Donald Trump. They also come as CNN is learning that details related to Russia's preference for Trump were not discussed in another classified briefing with committee staff, which took place prior to the closed-door meeting with lawmakers that has come under scrutiny in recent days. Speaking at a conference on election security in Washington, David Porter, the assistant section chief of the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force, said that Russia is waging a ""brazen and disruptive"" operation against the US aimed at dividing the population and undermining traditional sources of information, like the news media, to make room for misleading narratives. ""Election interference is one of the vectors in this space. It's designed to degrade confidence at the very foundation of our democratic system and our leaders' ability to govern,"" Porter said. ""It's also designed to weaken the adversary from within by identifying existing political and social issues and driving wedges into those fractural lines and [amplifying] them through online manipulation and disinformation in an effort to create an environment of permanent cacophony, unrest and conflict,"" he said. Senior intelligence official pushes back Porter did not discuss any preference that Russia or other foreign countries may have for a 2020 candidate, but his remarks come amid an ongoing controversy over a classified intelligence briefing that occurred earlier this month. During that briefing, members of the House Intelligence Committee were told that Moscow maintained a favorable disposition toward both Trump and Democratic presidential front-runner Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""To put it simply, in this space Russia wants to watch us tear ourselves apart while it seems China on the other hand would rather manage our gradual economic decline over the course of generations,"" Porter said. On Monday, however, a senior intelligence official pushed back on reports that Shelby Pierson, the top intelligence official on election threats, told lawmakers during the classified briefing earlier this month that Russia's efforts were aimed at helping Trump get reelected. ""During the [Feb 13] briefing, the Intelligence Community did not state that Russia is aiding the reelection of President Trump,"" the senior official said. The senior intelligence official also confirmed to CNN that the briefing was pre-coordinated effort by multiple agencies that have briefed congressional committees before and that this closed-door session was not just about Russia but multiple foreign actors. Three national security officials told CNN Sunday that Pierson had omitted important nuance and expanded beyond the intelligence community's formal assessment, which does not include evidence that Russia's interference this cycle is aimed at reelecting Trump. Sanders said last week that he had been told by officials that Russia was also seeking to help his campaign. Trump, meanwhile, has dismissed reports of Russia's preference toward him as a ""hoax"" fueled by Democrats. Staffers not briefed on Russian preference for Trump Meanwhile, CNN learned on Monday that there was another election security briefing for House Intelligence Committee staffers where the issue of Russia's preference for Trump did not come up at all, according to a source with knowledge of the briefing. The staff briefing occurred prior to the February 13 briefing with lawmakers. It is common practice for staffers to be briefed on sensitive matters before lawmakers, but in this case, the absence of any discussion about Russia's efforts to aid both Trump and Sanders during the staff briefing stands in stark contrast to the ongoing controversy over what intelligence officials told lawmakers behind closed doors earlier this month. Both briefings were conducted by multiple officials representing various relevant agencies and were intended to serve as a big picture overview of the threats to the 2020 election and was not specifically focused on just Russia, but also other foreign actors, according to three sources familiar with the briefing. Senior intelligence officials, including Pierson, have routinely stressed in recent months that Russia is not the only foreign actor working to interfere in the 2020 US election, noting efforts of nations like China and Iran. But during the briefing with lawmakers, intelligence officials described Moscow's support for both Trump and Sanders as part of its broader efforts to sow discord and undermine the American democratic process. That determination is based on an evolution of the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's interference in the 2016 US election, sources said. And despite the intention to brief lawmakers on the broader threat landscape, the classified session with lawmakers took a turn when some members began to question Pierson on how Russia's efforts have shifted in 2020, compared to the 2016 election, and what the intelligence community has done to address those changes, sources said. That's when Pierson made her comments about Trump and also Sanders, talking about how Russia's ultimate goal is to sow discord and undermine confidence in the American electoral system, the sources said, but with the known quantity that officials have assessed that Russia views Trump as having been beneficial to Russia during his time in office. However, nothing about Russia's preference for Trump was in Pierson's talking points, an intelligence official told CNN, a point echoed by a source familiar with the briefing materials. Specifically, the intelligence community's assessment with regard to Russia's views on Trump is based, in part, on the idea the current administration's policies have helped Moscow achieve some of its top geopolitical priorities, including disrupting the NATO/European Union alliance; the US withdrawal and disengagement in the Middle East, Africa and Asia; and helping undermine confidence in the US national security and intelligence apparatus. This assessment about Trump and Sanders is not something that's based on new underlying intelligence or concrete evidence but the analytical judgments of analysts tasked with looking at the big picture, according to the sources. But this was the area where Pierson was pressed on and seems to be at the core of the issue at hand. The intelligence official who spoke to CNN Monday also said that there is a difference between Russia preferring Trump and Moscow actively working to support his reelection. Right now, the official said, the intelligence community believes Russia just prefers Trump and it is too early in the process to tell if they are actively supporting his reelection rather than attempting to sow discord and chaos in the broader democratic system. ""I don't know that any intelligence assessment points to any choice of who they want to be president,"" the official said. ""I don't think to date there's an assessment that goes into that detail."" ""What should have come across would have been not that they're trying to help him win to be in office,"" the intelligence official said. This ""doesn't mean they want them [Trump and Sanders] to win, it means they're trying to make it a lot more questionable."" Regarding Sanders, intelligence analysts assess that Russia believes it benefited from supporting Sanders in 2016 and views those continued efforts as the most effective way to sow discord in the Democratic primaries, sources added. The most direct (and detailed) questions, as CNN has reported, came from Republican Rep. Will Hurd, who, as a former CIA officer, has a detailed understanding of the process, two of the sources said. Hurd's questions were related to the types of intelligence streams that backed up Pierson's statements about Trump, those sources said.

But most importantly, this dark new revival of a saga that has ravaged US politics for four years is making it impossible to know what's true anymore. Washington has been pitched back into a disorienting world of ungraspable truths, confusion and recrimination. And attempts by President Donald Trump and his opponents to weaponize new reports of Moscow's interference for political gain only risk deepening the sense of national disorientation. They could leave voters unable to process a controversy about intelligence few have seen in a way that will only undermine confidence that November's election will be legitimate. All of which will advance Russia's goal of tarnishing US democracy. The aim of any disinformation campaign is to foment bewilderment by trashing publicly agreed-upon facts. The state of politics in the current polarized era provides fertile openings for Russian social media trolls, bots and hackers. Mounting contradictory evidence over what exactly Russia is doing right now is only adding more uncertainty. First, it seemed that there was fresh evidence of Moscow putting its finger on the scale for the President, reviving speculation about his bizarre deference for Russian President Vladimir Putin. In the warped logic of this spy tale, Trump has convinced himself that such perceptions make other people doubt his legitimacy, a belief that causes him to act in self destructive ways that also undermine the US political system itself. But now, some intelligence officials tell CNN that the briefer who warned Congress about the operation may have overstated the intelligence and Moscow's perceived preference for the President. One intelligence official said that Shelby Pierson's characterization of the intelligence was ""misleading"" and a national security official said Pierson failed to provide the ""nuance"" needed to accurately convey the US intelligence conclusions. It was not clear whether Pierson's interpretation of the analysis was overly dramatic or whether her approach was appropriate and there was political pressure to tone down the intelligence community's conclusions. Democrats were quick to seize on the original reports to warn that Moscow is again in the game to help Trump win in November. The President and his aides hit back by claiming that the old KGB men in the Kremlin would much prefer a socialist, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in the Oval Office. And now both sides are thickening the fog by suggesting each leaked information about alleged meddling for political advantage. In a sense, it doesn't matter which version of these events is correct, since the effect is the same: a further eroding of trust in the democratic process. The uproar underscores that four years after the initial election interference by Russia, US society is ever more susceptible to outside manipulation. Torn national unity, distrust in institutions and a shattered concept of a mutual national reality -- much of which can be put down to Trump and reactions to his tumultuous presidency -- mean Washington is ripe for interference by foreign powers. All of which suggests Russia's efforts in 2016, updated for 2020, must rank as one of the most successful intelligence ops of all time. Furious Trump targets intelligence community -- not Russia The President reacted to reports that Russia was again meddling -- to help him win -- with fury last week in a way that again underscored how he's often more interested in protecting himself than the democracy that he's sworn to shield. He accused intelligence community briefers of giving Democrats an important electoral advantage by informing the House Intelligence Committee about the new Russian meddling and a supposed preference for Trump. He replaced acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire with a political acolyte with no top-level intelligence expertise, Richard Grenell, the controversial US ambassador to Germany. Another loyalist, Kashyap Patel, who worked to undermine original accounts of Russian election meddling, is also now at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Patel once worked for former Republican House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, who maintains a backchannel to Trump and has fanned the President's paranoia about a ""Deep State"" plot to undermine him in the intelligence establishment. Patel previously took direct aim at intelligence agencies with which he now works by helping to write the Nunes memo, a controversial document that alleged the FBI and the Justice Department abused Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act law by obtaining a warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The new arrivals at DNI are only multiplying the disconnect between the President and his intelligence agencies. They raise the possibility that only information helpful to Trump will emerge from the community. Such a scenario would infect the US clandestine services with politics and compromise their ability to maintain trust across the political spectrum. Political chicanery adds to confusion Hopes that the 2020 election would be immune from the corrosive effects of Russia intrigue quickly eroded. And political opportunism is now making the situation worse. On Sunday, Trump archly suggested that Democrats might begin to suspect that the victory by Sanders in Saturday's Nevada caucuses might have had its roots in Moscow. ""Are any Democrat operatives, the DNC, or Crooked Hillary Clinton, blaming Russia, Russia, Russia for the Bernie Sanders win in Nevada,"" the President asked in a tweet. Trump said on Sunday that he had not been briefed that Russia might be trying to help Sanders in the Democratic primary. CNN reported last week that Trump had been told. ""I read where Russia is helping Bernie Sanders,"" Trump told reporters at the White House before traveling to India. ""Nobody said it to me. Nobody said it to me at all. Nobody briefed me about that at all,"" the President said, further politicizing the issue of accusing House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of leaking on the issue. ""They ought to investigate Adam Schiff,"" Trump said. Schiff, who led the House impeachment case against Trump in his Senate trial, quickly pushed back. ""Nice deflection, Mr. President. But your false claims fool no one,"" Schiff wrote on Twitter. ""You welcomed Russian help in 2016, tried to coerce Ukraine's help in 2019, and won't protect our elections in 2020."" Another sign the administration is seeking to harvest the new Russian election meddling episode for political gain came in TV appearances by national security adviser Robert O'Brien. ""I don't think it's any surprise that Russia or China or Iran would want somebody other than President Trump,"" O'Brien told ABC News ""This Week."" O'Brien said he had seen no such intelligence or analysis that Russia is attempting to help Trump. But he suggested Moscow wanted Sanders to win the White House. ""There are these reports that they want Bernie Sanders to get elected president. That's no surprise. He honeymooned in Moscow,"" O'Brien told ABC. In past administrations, national security advisers have gone out of their way to avoid such flagrant political interventions. But this administration has often dismantled the political guardrails surrounding the presidency. Sanders warns Putin -- but adds a political twist Sanders responded to suggestions of Russian meddling last week with the kind of forceful denunciation of such activity that has been lacking from Trump. ""What I say to Mr. Putin, if elected president, trust me, you are not going to be interfering in American elections,"" Sanders said. The Vermont senator also however seemed to suggest -- without evidence -- that the report was leaked to damage him before the Nevada caucuses, which he won handsomely. His comment risked further politicizing the question of Russian election meddling in a way that could further undermine public confidence. Defeated 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton offered an opinion that did little to ease the controversy. ""Putin's Puppet is at it again, taking Russian help for himself,"" Clinton tweeted. One of the reasons why even a small Russian operation to stoke political discord is likely to succeed is the fractured national security consensus in Washington. CNN reported that Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee argued that Moscow couldn't be interfering because no President had been tougher on Russia. Such a view reflects an alternative reality view of the current presidency. While Trump has sent lethal arms to Ukraine, much of his foreign policy has seemed to play into Moscow's goals of weakening Western institutions like NATO. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Russia would like to see Trump reelected ""because he has been a gift to Russia."" ""He has essentially ceded the Middle East to Russian interests. He has accomplished more in the undermining of NATO than Russia has in the last 20 years,"" Murphy said. ""And he continues to effectively deny that they have an ongoing political operation here in the United States."" The flagrant political disagreements provoked by new reports of election interference highlight one clear truth about the current political environment: differing concepts of reality mean that foreign meddling may not be necessary anymore to undermine American democracy. Washington can get the job done itself.",20,1.1122014294266458,2.353401164255909,-1.2411997348292634,14
2020-01-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/10/politics/pompeo-trump-intelligence-community-here-are-the-facts/index.html,Pompeo says Trump has always relied on US intelligence. Here's what the facts say.,"In answering questions on Friday about the decision to kill Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that as President, Donald Trump has shown confidence in the intelligence agencies and their work. ""Look, I served as CIA director for the first year and a half of this administration,"" Pompeo said. ""I watched the President rely on the work that the intelligence community did for the entire time I served as the head of the Central Intelligence Agency."" The notion that Trump has always relied on the conclusions of the US intelligence community is contradicted by the President's repeated, high-profile disavowals of its findings and attacks against what he calls the ""deep state"" -- like when he compared the work of intelligence agencies to that of Nazis. There are numerous examples of Trump dismissing the conclusions of the US intelligence agencies. Russia interference The intelligence community, including the CIA, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, agrees: Russia interfered in the 2016 US election. Trump, on the other hand, has gone back and forth on this issue -- claiming at times that Russia did not interfere, only to reverse that claim months (and sometimes days) later. On October 7, 2016, the US intelligence community released a statement saying it was ""confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations"" and urged ""state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance."" President-elect Trump told Time magazine on November 28, 2016, ""I don't believe [Russia] interfered. That became a laughing point, not a talking point."" On January 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report outlining Russia's effort to interfere in the election. Days later, on January 11, Trump told reporters ""I think it was Russia"" that hacked the Democratic National Committee -- but he left open the possibility of other countries' involvement. In July 2017, Trump claimed that ""nobody really knows for sure"" whether Russia had interefered in the election, saying he thought it was Russia. ""I think it was Russia and I think it could have been other people and other countries. It could have been [that] a lot of people interfered."" But, he added, ""nobody really knows for sure."" Most famously, Trump sided with the conclusion of Russian President Vladimir Putin after their meeting in Helsinki, Finland, that it was not Russia that had interfered in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" Trump said. The next day Trump had to backtrack, saying he meant to say the exact opposite. ""The sentence should have been, 'I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia,' sort of a double negative,"" Trump said. ""So you can put that in, and I think that probably clarifies things pretty good."" This is only a glimpse of the many times Trump has contradicted or questioned findings from the intelligence community on the subject of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Read more: Trump vs. US intelligence on Russian election interference Ukraine meddling While dismissing the findings of the US intelligence community on Russian interference, Trump has pushed an alternative narrative that the Ukrainian government was the real culprit in 2016 US election meddling. That theory runs contrary to existing evidence and US intelligence, and was publicly debunked by a top national security adviser during the House impeachment hearings last year. Furthermore, US intelligence officials believe this theory originates with Russia, and is intended to shift the blame. In December The Washington Post reported that, according to a former senior White House official, Trump said he was sure Ukraine had meddled in the election because ""Putin told me."" The murder of Jamal Khashoggi In October 2018, reports circulated that Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi had been murdered at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey. Within a month, the CIA concluded with high confidence that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had directed Khashoggi's murder, which was conducted by members of bin Salman's inner circle. But Trump refused to accept that his ally was in any way responsible for Khashoggi's murder, ignoring what the intelligence community was telling him. In a November 2018 statement issued days after the release of the CIA's report, Trump said that ""it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"" Trump went so far as to side with Saudi Arabia's official stance over the conclusions of his own intelligence agency. A Saudi Embassy spokeswoman said in a statement that ""the claims in this purported assessment are false. We have and continue to hear various theories without seeing the primary basis for these speculations."" ""We may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,"" Trump said in his statement. ""In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.""",20,1.22451457216152,2.6941784543691996,-1.4696638822076795,14
2019-12-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/world/russia-ukraine-peace-paris-intl/index.html,"In Paris, Putin and Zelensky take hesitant steps toward peace","Ukraine and Russia have managed to inch forward on a long-dormant peace process, taking cautious new steps toward ending the conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. The leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia met in Paris for five and a half hours of talks on Monday, producing at the day's end a joint communique that said all parties would ""commit to a full and comprehensive implementation"" of a ceasefire in Ukraine by the end of the year. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel took part in the negotiations, but all eyes were on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who represent opposing sides in a five-year war that has claimed the lives of around 13,000 people. Russia and Ukraine have been locked in a proxy conflict that began in 2014, when Russia occupied and annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and backed pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region. Russia has never openly acknowledged that it is a belligerent in the conflict, although Ukraine and its Western backers say Moscow has sent military hardware, advisors and even conventional military forces to support the separatists. Monday's meeting was the first between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents since Zelensky took office earlier this year in a landslide election victory. The two leaders have already taken steps toward compromise: They recently hammered out a deal for a prisoner swap that paved the way for Monday's meeting. In Paris, the pair committed to an important new step, pledging to work toward local elections in the separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. But they avoided the thorny issue of when, exactly, that might happen. They remain far apart on the timing of elections to determine the status of territory currently controlled by separatists. At a press conference at the conclusion of the summit, Zelensky said Ukraine insists on full control of his country's eastern borders before such an election can take place, while Putin said that elections should come first. ""The president of the Russian Federation and I have a different view of the transfer of the border,"" Zelensky said. ""I'm saying the issue of border transfer should take place before the local elections."" The meeting was a study in contrasts, with Zelensky arriving in a low-key Renault and Putin in an armored black limousine. The Russian president is a practiced hand at this kind of international summitry: He has been on the international stage for two decades now, and he understands the element of theater that goes into such highly scripted meetings. Russian state television repeatedly showed a clip of Putin prodding Zelensky to turn around for a photo spray. ""It's good, I'm pleased,"" a relaxed-looking Putin told reporters as he walked past the press center and answered questions about his one-on-one talks with Zelensky. But while Zelensky may be the geopolitical novice, he also has advantages. He enjoys a broad popular mandate, despite a recent slip in the polls. And he represents a younger alternative to the increasingly geriatric post-Soviet leadership currently running Russia, and he can engage with Putin in his own language. It's also clear what Monday's meeting does not represent. Ukraine does not get back Crimea, something considered non-negotiable by Moscow. And Russia will not see a lifting of European sanctions that were imposed after the annexation of the semi-autonomous region in 2014. ""People in Eastern Ukraine have been waiting much too long for peace,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement earlier on Monday. ""At the moment [there is] no reason to change EU sanctions regime."" A one-on-one session between Putin and Zelensky in Paris did not resolve the biggest issue of who will control Ukraine's eastern border when elections happen in separatist regions. But it did, at least, show the two leaders could engage in dialogue.",4,4.59482351135674,5.2686031655687,-0.6737796542119598,15

A criminal investigation was opened by police in Kiev after they received a report of unknown individuals defacing the monument in honor of Yiddish author and playwright Sholem Aleichem. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko condemned the act of vandalism on Twitter: ""The anti-Semitic act on the Sholem Aleichem monument in Kiev is disgusting, appalling and in need of prompt investigation. The perpetrator(s) must be brought to justice."" Images on Ukrainian social media showed the monument, located across from the Brodsky Synagogue in central Kiev, painted with red swastikas. ""Police at the scene questioned the complainant and inspected the building and the surrounding area,"" the police statement read. ""In addition, law enforcement officers removed CCTV footage."" Ukraine has a large and thriving Jewish community, but community activists also report frequent cases of anti-Semitic vandalism. Rabbi Moshe Azman, the president of American Friends of Anatevka, a charity that helps Jews forced to flee the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, called the incident ""another provocation in front of our synagogue"" on his Facebook page. Who is Sholem Aleichem? Born in 1859 in Russia, Sholem Aleichem was a Yiddish author and playwright known in the United States as the ""Yiddish Mark Twain,"" according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. Americans would know his writing best from the musical ""Fiddler on the Roof."" His works were adapted into the script surrounding the musical numbers. Several of his other works were adapted and instrumental in the founding of the Yiddish Art Theatre in New York City. Before his death in 1916, Aleichem published more than 40 novels, stories, and plays in Yiddish. Last November, a man caused a commotion in a Baltimore theater last week by yelling ""Heil Hitler! Heil Trump!"" during a ""Fiddler on the Roof"" performance. He later apologized. ""I opened my mouth and it was so wrong. I know that now,"" the man told CNN affiliate WBAL.

The FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and relevant intelligence agencies announced Friday that the government will notify relevant members of Congress, state and local officials, private sector and the public of foreign interference ""where necessary to protect national security and the integrity of our elections,"" beyond existing laws and policies. Most intelligence concerning threats to election security is initially classified, making it difficult to quickly release to the public. When Russian intelligence conducted its election interference campaign in the leadup to the 2016 election, the FBI and DHS had difficulty conveying information about some cyber threats to county and state election officials who didn't have security clearance. ""There really is a sense of urgency to operationalize this information as quickly as possible,"" a senior intelligence official said on a call with reporters. ""I recognize that some constituents are skeptical about how we can quickly turn around this information, but I think there is an agreed-upon sense of urgency related to the framework to be able to best share information with those affected by this as quickly as possible."" President Donald Trump approved the new framework on October 31, the intelligence official said. The US intelligence community and bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee are both firm in their assessment that Russia launched a multifaceted campaign to meddle in the 2016 election, largely in support of Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump has brushed off those reports, going so far as to embrace a conspiracy theory that Ukraine instead was somehow responsible. The full framework is not being released to the public. A one-page summary, jointly authored by DHS, FBI, the Department of Justice, and the Office of National Intelligence, stresses the idea that the US intelligence community has a comprehensive, method for notifying state and local election officials of election threats. ""Partisan politics shall not play in role in the decision to provide notifications,"" it says. The framework introduces a process where if one agency wants to go above and beyond to notify someone of a potential threat, ""beyond what is required under existing laws and policies, the decision will be informed by a group of experts from different Intelligence Community agencies,"" the summary says.",20,4.886577312164947,3.1270834170155553,1.759493895149392,14

The Treasury Department for the first time used new executive authorities, meant to ward off foreign actors from interfering in US elections, to target Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian financier behind the Internet Research Agency. The firm was indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for interfering in the 2016 elections. The US government also took the additional step Monday of putting limits on Prigozhin's assets -- including the Russian's luxury personal property of three aircraft and a yacht used for his family's international vacations -- as well as on six employees of the agency he finances. Anyone doing business with Prigozhin or using his planes or yachts now faces the prospect of US sanctions themselves. 2020 elections The Treasury Department made clear that it was targeting Prigozhin and the Internet Research Agency for ""its attempts to subvert American democratic processes"" in 2018, but it also stressed that the US was watching other foes as the 2020 presidential vote approaches. ""Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of American democracy, and we will use our authorities against anyone seeking to undermine our processes and subversively influence voters,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement. ""This Administration will work tirelessly to safeguard our electoral process, and will aggressively pursue any other foreign actor that attempts to interfere in the 2020 elections."" A statement by Treasury identified other actors the department is watching: ""While today's action only targets Russian actors, the U.S. Government is safeguarding our democratic processes from adversaries -- primarily Russia, Iran, and China -- that may be seeking to influence the upcoming 2020 elections."" Treasury added that while it was sanctioning Prigozhin and others for their activities in the 2018 midterms, there ""was no indication that foreign actors were able to compromise election infrastructure that would have prevented voting, changed vote counts, or disrupted the tallying of votes."" The move to sanction Russian efforts to undermine US democracy comes as President Donald Trump is under intense scrutiny for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in exchange for weapons systems it wanted to defend against Russia. Lawmakers pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Trump have condemned his efforts -- obscured by White House officials who tried to hide records of the call in a classified system -- as an attempt to have a foreign country interfere in the 2020 elections. Analysts say the effort has served to strengthen Russia, which has occupied Crimea and continues to conduct a war in eastern Ukraine. Treasury said Prigozhin spent significant funds to further the Internet Research Agency's attempted influence operations in connection with the 2018 midterm elections. The organization used fictitious personas on social media and disseminated false information in an effort to influence the 2018 elections and try to undermine faith in US democratic institutions. Among other examples, Treasury cites a 2018 statement on the website ""Internet Research Agency American Division"" claiming that the organization sought to discredit candidates it deemed hostile to Russia and that it was utilizing social media to further its campaign. Putin's 'personal chef' Prigozhin had previously been indicted by the US in a case involving a troll factory that spearheaded Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 elections. The Treasury Department also slapped the Internet Research Agency with sanctions in March 2018. In addition to Prigozhin, Treasury announced it is imposing sanctions on six members of the Internet Research Agency for their work at the organization. ""As of 2018, Dzheykhun Nasimi Ogly Aslanov (Aslanov), Mikhail Leonidovich Burchik (Burchik), Vadim Vladimirovich Podkopaev (Podkopaev), Vladimir Dmitriyevich Venkov (Venkov), Igor Vladimirovich Nesterov (Nesterov), and Denis Igorevich Kuzmin (Kuzmin) were all members of the Internet Research Agency involved in attempting to interfere in U.S. elections,"" Treasury said in a press release. Prigozhin has a colorful past. Known as Putin's ""personal chef,"" he spent nine years in prison in the 1980s for fraud and robbery, according to Russian media reports. After his release, he went into the catering business -- renovating a boat and opening New Island, one of a half-dozen upscale restaurants he owns in St. Petersburg. Putin turned to him to cater his birthday parties as well as dinners with visiting leaders. In 2002, he served caviar and truffles to President George W. Bush during a summit in St. Petersburg.",20,3.572693219029701,2.636324403999316,0.9363688150303853,14

The statement, released on Monday at the United Nations ahead of the beginning of the UN General Assembly's General Debate, is largely a broadly written agreement that countries should follow international law. While views of what constitutes acceptable state-sponsored hacking vary, the US and its allies generally agree on a basic rules. It's fair game for intelligence services to hack targets purely to spy and to attack military targets, but attacking civilian infrastructure or to give a country an economic advantage is off limits. The signatories include the members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) as well as other major European nations, Colombia, Japan and South Korea. The signatories mirror the large group of countries involved the previous two occasions that countries jointly blamed a cyberattack on one country, China, for a more than decade-long hacking campaign, and Russia for creating the infamous NotPetya ransomware worm, which spiraled out of control and locked up computers around the world. Though it doesn't name them, the statement also explicitly condemns two types of behavior that are each generally associated with just one country — efforts to ""undermine democracies and international institutions and organizations, and undercut fair competition in our global economy by stealing ideas when they cannot create them."" Russia has been repeatedly accused of hacking political campaigns to meddle in multiple elections to favor candidates it perceives as more friendly to the Kremlin, including Ukraine in 2014, the US in 2016 and France in 2017. China has for years been widely condemned for hacks of businesses around the world that help Chinese companies Both countries have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, often straining diplomatic relations in the process. Neither country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately responded to request for comment. While the statement calls for ""consequences for bad behavior in cyberspace,"" it falls short of spelling out what kind of international penalties a country that engages in that behavior might incur. ""The purpose of a statement like this is to show to the international community that we've already agreed to a lot in the international system,"" Tobias Feakin, Australia's ambassador for cyber affairs, told CNN. ""So having 27 different countries sign that statement is a very powerful illustration that more and more countries are becoming tired of other states who're unwilling to adhere to what we've already agreed to in international law. And it's really pertinent that it's done when the world's attention is on the UN,"" he said.",20,4.132794911073394,3.181312948102037,0.9514819629713571,26
2019-09-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/18/politics/veterans-foreign-influence-online-campaigns/index.html,"US veterans and service members targeted by foreign entities online, report finds","US veterans, current service members and their families are being targeted online with malware and by foreign entities and influence campaigns, and the government isn't doing enough to stop it, a new report says. The study by Vietnam Veterans of America, a non-profit that advocates for and serves the needs of all veterans, documents a myriad number of ways veterans are impersonated and targeted online -- particularly on Facebook. In at least one instance, they've been targeted by influence campaigns from foreign governments. Russia's Internet Research Agency, for instance -- the ""troll factory"" with ties to the Russian government that creates content to push divisive messages on American social media -- purchased more than a hundred online ads targeting US service members and veterans, the study found. It also specifically purchased ads focused on people who followed a number of legitimate organizations on Facebook, including Vietnam Veterans of America, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and Concerned Veterans for America. But the sources of the efforts to target veterans was not always clear. The report found numerous other Facebook pages and groups, often with moderators who were listed in countries like Russia (though not necessarily tied to the IRA) and ""with concentrations in Eastern Europe and Vietnam"", that follow very similar trends. One Facebook page called Vietnam Veterans, which has been around since at least 2016, posted both photos of VVA's president to imply a relation with the group, and re-posted Russian IRA memes. Another, the since-deleted ""Vietnam Vets of America,"" mimicked the VVA logo, a legitimate organization with its own Facebook page, and frequently posted links to a now-defunct inflammatory news blog called vvets.eu. Another page, We Are Veterans, which was created in 2017, mimics a legitimate page called We Honor Veterans, an extension of a group in Alexandria, Virginia, that provided companionship to veterans in hospice care. All nine administrators for We Are Veterans are listed as coming from Vietnam. In addition to also posting both IRA-created and pro-Trump memes, the page has at times offered military-themed memorabilia for sale. Given some of those targeted are active duty service members, the security concerns are heightened, the authors caution. They even include examples from the conflict in Ukraine highlighted how conventional warfare mixed with cyber-attacks can have deadly consequences. ""The unfortunate reality is that bad actors, exploiting Facebook's openness and reach, have used this American-bred company to spread disinformation, sow division and undermine our very own democracy,"" Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN. ""And they've done this, in part, by zeroing in on service members and veterans."" Facebook periodically announces it has proactively taken down what it describes as ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" -- some of those fall into the category of influence campaigns, which usually benefit a particular country's government. But Facebook isn't aware of all its users' intentions, and tips from some past takedowns have originated with other tech companies or the FBI. In total, VVA inspected more than 150 pages, with moderators originating from at least 32 different countries. For its part, Facebook has shut down at least a third of the pages that the VVA has flagged, citing inauthentic behavior. Facebook declined to comment on the record about how it identifies where page administrators come from. In a statement, spokeswoman Jennifer Martinez said, ""This report describes several instances of veterans being targeted on social media. We take these issues seriously and will continue to work with the veterans community to address their concerns."" In at least one known instance, according to the Washington Post, the US government has taken direct action to disrupt such actors: US Cyber Command reportedly blocked the IRA's internet access during the 2018 midterm election. Unclear who should play defense But it's less clear who's supposed to play defense. The study's author, VVA researcher Kris Goldsmith, told CNN he doesn't solely put the blame on the tech platforms they highlighted including Facebook, and wants the government to take a proactive role in protecting veterans from influence operations and scams. ""The fact that it's on Facebook makes it look to members of Congress right now as if like it's all Facebook's fault,"" Goldsmith said. ""In our view, Facebook's an American asset, one of the most important American companies to ever exist, one that can be a force for good to spread democracy around the world, and our adversaries have turned it against us."" The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, for instance, should ""coordinate federal efforts to protect servicemembers and veterans from deceptive, foreign-generated online content,"" he wrote in the study, but the agencies have not responded to him. In a statement to CNN, Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said current personnel ""must undergo annual cyber security training. As part of this training, personnel learn about the potential dangers of social media, phishing and other cyber threats, as well as measures they can take to protect themselves."" Veterans Affairs spokesman Randal Noller told CNN that ""Veterans are the targets of many of the same types of fraud as the rest of society, including mail, telephone and online fraud."" ""VA appreciates this group's views and will respond to them directly,"" Noller added.",20,3.3400376222975323,4.137983537242857,-0.7979459149453243,28
2019-05-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/politics/barr-intelligence-review-allies-reaction/index.html,US intelligence partners wary of Barr's Russia review,"Key allies who share intelligence with the United States could soon be dragged into the middle of Attorney General Bill Barr's politically-charged Justice Department review of how the Russia investigation began. President Donald Trump has said he wants Barr to look into the role key intelligence partners, including the United Kingdom and Australia, played in the origins of Russia probe. He has said he could raise the issue with the British Prime Minister Theresa May during his state visit next week and suggested he may ask her about his accusation that Britain spied on his 2016 presidential campaign. In describing the scope of Barr's mission to declassify and study the pre-election Obama-era intelligence, among several other topics, Trump told reporters, ""I hope he looks at the UK and I hope he looks at Australia and I hope he looks at Ukraine."" For now, those allies are trying to stay out of the fray, arguing it's a domestic issue. But the President has granted Barr -- not the intelligence community -- sweeping powers to decide what intelligence can be declassified. That means Barr could potentially reveal intelligence shared with the US by other countries related to Russian election meddling and, in the process, risk damaging those critical relationships with foreign partners. The United Kingdom and Australia are members of the critical so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance, rounded out by the United States, New Zealand and Canada. Both have so far publicly stayed quiet, emphasizing their friendships with the US but national security officials in those countries are watching and waiting, following closely while refraining from criticizing a process that could call into question their intelligence gathering and reveal their methods and sources. ""If the review were to declassify sensitive intelligence -- especially if doing so compromised the safety of sources -- that would cause very grave concern,"" a former senior British ambassador told CNN. ""It could even affect the readiness of close allies like Britain to continue sharing the most sensitive material with the US."" ""This is a matter for the US authorities,"" a senior British official in London added, while the embassy in Washington declined to comment. One official from a Five Eyes partner said that a balance needs to be struck between the review of intelligence and national security matters with the need to protect classified information. Australian officials declined to comment but Foreign Minister Marise Payne told a radio interviewer on Monday they don't want to ""engage in a public commentary that might entirely risk that we seem to prejudice the ongoing examination of these matters in the US."" There is increased wariness because of the President's signature unpredictability but Barr is seen as a steady hand and intelligence partners are comforted by their lengthy friendships with their American counterparts. In Britain's case, the drama surrounding Brexit also means they are keen not to rock the boat. ""For Brexit and other reasons, the British government is keen to stay closely aligned with the Trump administration, despite significant differences on climate, trade, and foreign policy,"" the former British ambassador said. ""The UK will probably not want to say much in public about the Barr review of inter-agency links."" Trump might bring up Five Eyes spying with May Until now, the Barr review hasn't gotten much public attention in the UK, with recent headlines dominated by the dramas surrounding Brexit, May's resignation and European Parliament elections. But the British press' attention will soon turn back to the Trump and the tension in the ""special relationship"" with the President's state visit to the UK next week. Asked whether he would raise the possibility of Five Eyes countries spying on his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump told reporters on Friday he could do so with outgoing Prime Minister May. ""There's word and rumor that the FBI and others were involved, CIA were involved, with the UK, having to do with the Russian hoax,"" Trump told reporters on Friday. ""And I may very well talk to her about that, yes."" Despite the public disagreement between Trump and the US intelligence community over whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election, the top US intelligence chief said the Barr will get ""all the appropriate information"" for the review of intelligence into Russia's election attacks. But Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned Barr against being too public with what he declassifies. ""I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the IC in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-sensitive classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk,"" Coats said in a statement. When asked if the Department of Justice has provided any assurances regarding the protection of intelligence provided by foreign partners, an ODNI spokesperson referred CNN to Coats' statement from last week. The Justice Department declined to comment. Foreign intelligence and the 2016 election It was the Australians who tipped off the FBI that Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos knew about the Russians having damaging emails that could influence the election, months before that information became public. The Australians knew because Papadopoulos bragged about it to the Australian ambassador to the UK in May 2016, and they brought the tip to the FBI's attention in July 2016, after WikiLeaks started releasing hacked Democratic emails. According to the Mueller report, which never identified Australia by name, ""the FBI opened its investigation of potential coordination between Russia and the Trump Campaign a few days later based on the information."" This came soon after British and European intelligence agencies told their US counterparts about communications they intercepted between Trump associates, Russian officials and other Russian individuals during the campaign. Since Trump won the election, British and American intelligence officials have insisted they continue to work together as closely as ever, despite the tumult at tops of their leadership. But Trump's disregard for the intelligence community has strained ties with some of its strongest partners. Yet at the same time, Trump has repeatedly perpetuated baseless accusations of spying against critical allies. Specifically, Trump has repeatedly alleged -- without any evidence -- that the Obama administration wiretapped him during the 2016 presidential campaign with the help of a British spy agency. A former senior US official pointed to the President sharing highly classified intelligence about ISIS obtained from Israel with Russia's foreign minister and US ambassador during an Oval Office meeting in May 2017 as an example of Trump's casual attitude when it comes to protecting sensitive information. ""Going all the way back to that point we've seen strains in the intelligence sharing relationship we have within the Five Eyes community,"" the former official said. ""I have not seen these types of strains in our relationship since the immediate aftermath of the [2013] Edward Snowden revelations."" That added pressure is particularly problematic when the intelligence concerns Russia, as it does in the Barr review, the former official added. ""Intelligence related to Russian activities and influence around the world is through not only our own collection but comparing what we gather with what our other Five Eyes partners are gathering."" On Capitol Hill, Democrats have blasted the President's decision to declassify the pre-election intelligence. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff accused Trump of ""conspiring to weaponize"" classified information while Senate Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Mark Warner told CNN that the move ""has the potential to jeopardize"" key relationships with foreign partners. ""Trust and confidentiality are essential aspects of our partnerships with foreign intelligence services -- and the President's bizarre decision to allow the Attorney General to selectively and unilaterally declassify information certainly has the potential to jeopardize those relationships,"" Warner said.",20,2.4044895701204876,3.043446489871029,-0.6389569197505414,10
2019-05-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/politics/trump-tweets-putin/index.html,Trump says Russia investigation coverage overshadowed the 'tremendous potential' of his call with Putin,"President Donald Trump on Saturday accused media coverage of the Russia investigation of overshadowing the ""tremendous potential"" of his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- a shift from his own description of a call spent lamenting special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation but not warning Putin against continued Russian meddling in the 2020 election. ""Very good call yesterday with President Putin of Russia,"" Trump tweeted. ""Tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia, despite what you read and see in the Fake News Media. Look how they have misled you on 'Russia Collusion.' The World can be a better and safer place. Nice!"" When tweeting about the call's contents after talking with Putin Friday morning, Trump said that the two ""discussed Trade, Venezuela, Ukraine, North Korea, Nuclear Arms Control and even the 'Russian Hoax'"" in a ""very productive talk."" ""As I have always said, long before the Witch Hunt started, getting along with Russia, China, and everyone is a good thing, not a bad thing,"" he added. When asked on Friday about the call, Trump said he did not tell the Russian president to halt the Kremlin's efforts to interfere in American elections. ""We didn't discuss that. Really, we didn't discuss it. We discussed five or six things. We also went into great detail on various things,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after the phone call. In his investigation, Mueller spotlighted Russian interference, indicting 12 Russian military intelligence officers last year and indicating newly discovered ways that Russia meddled in the 2016 election in his final report. The intelligence community has long warned Trump of Russia's longstanding interference efforts that show no signs of stopping -- and that the President has shown little interest in combating. In January, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned Congress that Russia and other foreign countries were expected to target the 2020 elections. ""We assess that foreign actors will view the 2020 US elections as an opportunity to advance their interests,"" Coats told the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time. ""We expect them to refine their capabilities and add new tactics as they learn from each other's experiences and efforts in previous elections."" Coats and a slew of other officials -- then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo, FBI Director Chris Wray, NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley and National Geospatial Intelligence Agency Director Robert Cardillo -- also all confirmed last year the intelligence community's findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 and would continue targeting future elections. But the President has seemingly declined to heed his intelligence advisers' warnings. A US government official previously told CNN that getting the White House to focus on Russian election interference was ""like pulling teeth,"" adding that ""in general, senior White House staff felt it wasn't a good idea to bring up issues related to Russia in front of the President.""",20,2.5489211074511156,4.074464057478114,-1.5255429500269981,14
2019-04-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/25/africa/russia-sudan-minvest-plan-to-quell-protests-intl/index.html,Fake news and public executions: Documents show a Russian company's plan for quelling protests in Sudan,"When anti-government protests erupted in Sudan at the end of last year, the response of President Omar al-Bashir came straight from the dictators' playbook -- a crackdown that led to scores of civilian deaths. At the same time, a more insidious strategy was being developed -- one that involved spreading misinformation on social media, blaming Israel for fomenting the unrest, and even carrying out public executions to make an example of ""looters."" The author of this strategy was not the Sudanese government. According to documents seen by CNN, it was drawn up by a Russian company tied to an oligarch favored by the Kremlin: Yevgeny Prigozhin. Multiple government and military sources in Khartoum have confirmed to CNN that Bashir's government received the proposals and began to act on them, before Bashir was deposed in a coup earlier this month. One official of the former regime said Russian advisers monitored the protests and began devising a plan to counter them with what he called ""minimal but acceptable loss of life."" While the documents do not come from official Russian agencies, they were essentially a blueprint for protecting the Kremlin's interests in Sudan and keeping Bashir in power. The documents seen by CNN, which include letters and internal company communications, are among several thousand obtained and investigated by the London-based Dossier Center, run by exiled Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The Dossier Center receives data, documents and other information from a variety of sources, often anonymous, and shares them with journalists. Khodorkovsky ran afoul of President Vladimir Putin after alleging widespread corruption in Russia and spent several years in prison for alleged tax fraud -- which he has always denied. CNN has assessed the documents to be credible. They are also consistent with the accounts of witnesses who say Russian observers were seen at the recent protests in Sudan. Sudan has been Moscow's template for expanding its influence in Africa and around the globe: A hybrid of private and state interests that rewards both oligarchs and the Kremlin. It's a low-cost strategy that gives Moscow a foothold in strategic places, without the commitment of regular forces or major investment by the Russian government. Instead it uses companies that supply private contractors in return for commercial concessions. Indeed, the documents seen by CNN originate from a St. Petersburg-based company, M-Invest, which has an office in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. M-Invest lists as its core business the ""extraction of ores and sands of precious metals."" As CNN has previously reported, the company was granted concessions for a gold mine in Sudan. But its activities seem to have gone far beyond mining. What the Dossier Center's documents show President Bashir cultivated a close relationship with the Kremlin, visiting Moscow in 2017. Russia supplied modern Su-35 fighter jets in the same year. Put simply, Russia had placed a big bet on Bashir. As protests against the regime gathered steam, that bet was at risk. According to the documents reviewed by CNN, M-Invest drew up a plan to discredit and suppress those protests. One document from early January, reviewed by CNN, proposes spreading claims that protesters were attacking mosques and hospitals. It also suggested creating an image of demonstrators as ""enemies of Islam and traditional values"" by planting LGBT flags among them. And it proposed a social media campaign claiming that ""Israel supports the protesters."" The strategy also suggested the government ""simulate a dialogue with the opposition and demonstrate the openness of the government"" in order to ""isolate leaders of the protest and gain time."" M-Invest proposed ways to make the government look good -- through widely publicized ""free distribution of bread, flour, grain, food."" But most of its focus was on the protests. It recommended fabricating evidence ""of arson by protesters against mosques, hospitals and nurseries, [and] stealing grain from the public store."" It also suggested blaming the West for the protests and using ""extensive media coverage of the interrogation of detainees, where they admit they arrived to organize civil war in Sudan."" And it even proposed ""public executions of looters and other spectacular events to distract the protest-minded audience."" CNN made multiple efforts to reach M-Invest. Its phone number in St. Petersburg did not work. An Arabic speaker answered a call to its office in Khartoum but hung up. CNN visited the address but was told the space was leased to a Russian company called Mir Gold. Another company document recommends the arrest of protest leaders the day before demonstrations are due to take place -- and spreading disinformation by saying that protesters were being paid to take part. Also recommended: Show how ""security forces detained a car with weapons, foreign currency, propaganda materials operated by foreign citizens."" M-Invest also proposed building social media teams to attack the protest movement, ""starting disputes with users and voicing alternative agenda...The optimal number of accounts working in parallel -- 40-50."" In some ways the playbook is similar to that deployed by the Internet Research Agency, accused by US authorities of trying to disrupt the 2016 US election campaign. Prigozhin -- kown as ""Putin's chef"" for the catering contracts he held with the Kremlin -- was one of 13 Russians charged as part of the investigation into Russian election interference by US special counsel Robert Mueller. The US alleges that fictitious social media sites were set up to polarize voters with inflammatory and, in some cases, fake information. Prigozhin has denied any involvement in election meddling, and has denied any connection to the Internet Research Agency. Calls to his main company, Concord Management and Consulting, went unanswered. The documents reviewed by CNN do not indicate that official Russian security agencies were directly involved in trying to suppress the protests in Sudan. Foreign Ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova said at a press briefing in January: ""We are informed that some employees of Russian private security firms, who have no relation to the Russian government authorities, are indeed working in Sudan. But their functions are limited to personnel training."" Time starts to run out Sources in Khartoum have told CNN that Bashir's government did try to begin implementing some of M-Invest's plans. For example, it began detaining students from the Darfur region and accused them of trying to foment civil war -- one of the ploys recommended by M-Invest. The sources say Russian advisers from a private company were placed in several ministries and the National Intelligence Service. But it was too little, too late. In a letter to Bashir, drafted on March 17, Prigozhin complained that the Sudanese government's ""inaction"" had ""provoked the intensification of the crisis."" And he added, with unknowing prescience: ""The lack of active steps by the new government to overcome the crisis is likely to lead to even more serious political consequences."" Another letter from Prigozhin, dated April 6, praised the longtime Sudanese ruler as a ""wise and far-sighted leader"" but urged immediate economic reforms to solve the crisis. Five days later, Bashir was deposed. The military dimension Sudan, a resource-rich nation which has borders with seven other countries, has been shunned by the West. Its Red Sea coast was of particular interest to Moscow, because of recent moves by the United States and China to establish a military presence in the region. Moscow has been eyeing the development of a naval base at Port Sudan. Again, M-Invest was involved. In June 2018, it drafted a letter on behalf of Sudan's Military Industrial Corporation to push closer military links. It mentions a visit the previous month by the deputy commander of the Russian navy, Lt. Gen. Oleg Makarevich, which had discussed ""the possibility of creating on the territory of the Republic of Sudan point of logistics ships of The Russian Navy."" The letter is addressed to Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian armed forces. Gerasimov is credited with promoting the use of alternative measures to military force -- including political and economic levers as well as influencing public opinion through social media -- to destabilize adversaries. Yevgeny Prigozhin has been a pioneer and partner in Russia's hybrid strategy. Not only was the Internet Research Agency connected to his company Concord Management; he was also linked to a company, Evro Polis, which secured oil exploration rights in Syria. At the time, fighters of a company called Wagner, a private military contractor were also operating in Syria. As CNN has previously reported, Wagner is led by Dmitry Utkin, who is under US sanctions for assisting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Utkin has long been close to Prigozhin's inner circle Prigozhin's sprawling business empire is difficult to unravel. But the mining concession on behalf of M-Invest in Sudan was signed by a director named Mikhail Potepkin. A man of the same name also co-owned a company called IT-Debugger with Anna Bogacheva, one of those named in Mueller's indictment of 13 Russians as working for the Internet Research Agency. Potepkin also identifies himself as a project manager for another company, Megaline, which is 50% owned by Prigozhin's holding company Concord, according to company records. In a note on Megaline's letterhead to Sudan's minerals ministry in 2017, he says that M-Invest ""will enjoy all the necessary support of the Megaline Group."" CNN was unable to contact Potepkin. M-Invest also signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry, seen by CNN, for the use of transport aircraft of the 223rd Flight. Between August 2018 and February 2019, two aircraft of the 223rd Flight made at least nine flights to Khartoum. One of those planes took Bashir on his controversial visit to Syria last December, the first by an Arab leader since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. Russia has also reinforced its presence in the neighboring Central African Republic, sending convoys of supplies across the border. Whether Sudan will remain central to Russian ambitions in Africa depends on the unfolding situation in Khartoum. Moscow will not give up easily. It has strong links with the Sudanese military, which is now in the driving seat -- even if Bashir, the man described by Prigozhin as a ""wise and balanced politician,"" is now in a high-security prison.",20,4.632342186047784,4.235178770547452,0.39716341550033185,28
2019-03-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/20/politics/us-b-52-bombers-uk-russia/index.html,US Air Force deploys B-52 bombers to Europe in message to Russia,"The US Air Force recently deployed six nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to Europe for ""theater integration and flying training"" exercises with regional allies and NATO partners -- a move viewed as sending a strong message to Russia, which is celebrating the five-year anniversary of its military annexation of Crimea. A bomber task force of B-52 Stratofortresses, airmen and support equipment from the 2nd Bomb Wing based out of Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, arrived at RAF Fairford late last week and has been participating in various training missions across Europe, according to the service. On Monday, four B-52s ""conducted flights to several places in Europe, including to the Norwegian Sea, the Baltic Sea/Estonia and the Mediterranean Sea/Greece,"" the Air Force said. B-52 bombers from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, and RAF Fairford have also conducted ""simultaneous theater familiarization training in the Indo-Pacific and Europe"" as bombers ""flew north to an area east of the Kamchatka Peninsula,"" near Russia. ""Collectively, the flights from the Indo-Pacific and Europe demonstrated US commitment to allies and partners through the global employment of military forces,"" the Air Force said in a news release. Weighing 185,000 pounds, the B-52 first entered service in the 1950s during the height of the Cold War, originally designed to serve as long-range, high-altitude intercontinental nuclear bombers that could strike deep into the Soviet Union. The newest B-52 entered service in 1962, and the 159-foot plane became a Cold War icon. The planes have been modified heavily since the end of the Cold War and have been upgraded with precision-guided missiles, electronics and high-tech sensors. Each aircraft can carry up to 70,000 pounds of bombs, mines and missiles, according to the Air Force's official fact sheet. Tension with Moscow Tensions between the US and Russia have steadily increased in recent months following Russia's seizure of Ukrainian ships and detention of Ukrainian sailors after a confrontation in the Kerch Strait in November. Russia's actions and its detention of the Ukrainian sailors prompted President Donald Trump to cancel a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the G-20 summit in Argentina last year. Moscow has continued to ramp up its own military presence in the region, prompting the US to do the same. But the top US commander in the region says it doesn't appear to be working. ""I'm not comfortable yet with the deterrent posture that we have in Europe,"" Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti said earlier this month, warning that his command faced shortfalls with regard to land and naval forces as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets. ""Of concern is my intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capacity given that increasing and growing threat of Russia. I need more ISR,"" he added. ""In light of Russia's modernizing and increasingly aggressive force posture EUCOM recommends augmenting our assigned and rotational forces to enhance our deterrence posture,"" Scaparrotti said. This week, two Russian generals said Moscow plans to send nuclear-capable bombers and medium-range missiles to the peninsula -- but quickly retracted their statements. Still, NATO lashed out at Russia for its ""wide-ranging military buildup in Crimea"" and the US National Security Council said Monday that Moscow's annexation of Ukrainian territory ""continues to pose a threat to our regional allies."" While Trump's long-standing criticism of NATO over burden-sharing costs continues to hang over the 29-member military alliance, the US has increased its military presence in Europe during his administration as the US and Europe seek to counter Russia's actions in the region. Trump has been reluctant to publicly criticize Russia throughout his time in office but the US Congress continues to introduce new sanctions and acts targeting Putin for various affronts, including the annexation of Crimea. But that has done little to deter Putin from insisting the Ukrainian territory rightfully belongs to Russia. Putin traveled to Crimea this week and rallied crowds by saying a new powerful Russia has emerged that will stand up for its interests. No military solution US Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker said on Monday that ""there is no military solution"" through which Ukraine could reclaim Crimea. ""That would be militarily a disaster. It would lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives. It's not something anyone should be contemplating,"" Volker said on the fifth anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea. ""So there's no taking it back by force,"" Volker said during a news briefing delivered by video feed from Brussels, Belgium. Volker said the US would be willing to provide additional arms sales ""to help them develop a strong, capable, sustainable defense capability."" He said ""it's possible"" that the US would provide more anti-tank systems as well as air and coastal defenses. On the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO in the near future, Volker said he couldn't predict. He noted it depends on ""how quickly Ukraine can progress"" on such issues as standards of democracy, anti-corruption and civil control of the military, as well as when NATO decides the appropriate time for a formal invitation. Volker said he hoped Russia would not react strongly when that happens. Volker said the international community would continue to sanction Russia until Crimea was restored to Ukraine. He also deflected criticism that the West is culpable for the annexation, saying Russia was solely to blame ""What we have is not a lack of an appropriate format. What we have is a lack of political will from Russia,"" he noted of the political process.",4,4.29540548304105,4.067770746686586,0.22763473635446463,21

A graduate of the Air Force Academy and former F-15 pilot, Wolters has had numerous operational deployments during the first Gulf War and post 9/11 conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. He will replace US Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, who has held the job since 2016. The post has always been held by a US officer. He will only be the fourth Air Force officer to hold the post of NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, a post first held by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Trump has long been critical of the 29-member military alliance, blasting allies for not spending enough on defense. However despite these criticisms the US has increased its military presence in Europe during the Trump administration as the US and Europe seek to counter Russia following Moscow's 2014 intervention in Ukraine.",7,0.0,0.0,0.0,21
2019-02-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/politics/nato-social-media-influence-report/index.html,Researchers used fake social media accounts to influence NATO troops during military exercise,"Researchers were able to use fake Facebook and Instagram accounts to ""instill undesirable behavior"" among NATO troops participating in an exercise, according to a report published this week. The goal of the experiment, which was conducted by NATO's Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, was to ""exploit social media and open source data to gather information on and influence military personnel during a military exercise."" ""The level of personal detail we found was very detailed and enabled us to instill undesirable behavior during the exercise,"" the report said, adding that the scope of the experiment was ""limited"" when compared to ""large-scale efforts such as the work undertaken by the Kremlin's Internet Research Agency to influence the US presidential election 2016."" ""We identified a significant amount of people taking part in the exercise and managed to identify all members of certain units, pinpoint the exact locations of several battalions, gain knowledge of troop movements to and from exercises, and discover the dates of the active phases of the exercise,"" the report said. Details of the experiment were first reported by Wired. The experiment used Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to gather information although the report said Twitter ""was rarely used during the exercise, and gave no useful information."" ""Our experiment showed that, at the current level of information security, an adversary is able to collect a significant amount of personal data on soldiers participating in a military exercise, and that this data can be used to target messages with precision, successfully influencing members of the target audience to carry out desired behaviors,"" the report added while noting that effort encountered some challenges as social media companies pushed back on some of the fake accounts, indicating they ""are increasing their efforts to prevent abuse of their platforms."" The report said that ""Facebook in particular provided significant pushback,"" suspending several of the fake accounts and pages used during the experiment. NATO regularly conducts large-scale exercises in order to maintain the readiness of its military forces. One of the more recent exercises, Trident Juncture, took place in October-November and involved some 50,000 personnel from NATO and partner countries as well as hundreds of aircraft, dozens of ships and up to 10,000 military vehicles. While the efforts detailed in the report were only an experiment, officials have said that Russia has similarly used social media and other measures in its attempts to affect NATO troops deployed near the alliance's eastern border with Russia. ""We have seen some hybrid warfare tactics used against NATO troops in the eastern part of our Alliance, including disinformation, false allegations of criminal activity, and attempts to hack or intimidate our soldiers on social media,"" NATO official told CNN. ""It is important that NATO Allies continue to train their troops to be vigilant, including online. At the same time, we are strengthening our cyber defenses and taking all necessary measures to protect our networks,"" the official added. NATO has boosted its military presence in the eastern part of the alliance a move seen largely as a response to Russia's 2014 military intervention in Ukraine and Moscow's seizure of Crimea. Some 4,500 NATO troops are deployed as part of four multinational battle groups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The battle groups are led by the UK, Canada, Germany and the US respectively. The Latvia-based NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence was launched in 2014.",20,0.0,0.0,0.0,16
