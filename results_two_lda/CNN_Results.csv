Temperatures have plummeted in Ukraine this week, putting the country's power grid under extra strain as engineers try to repair damage caused by fresh Russian missile strikes, according to state energy company Ukrenergo. ""Due to a dramatic drop in temperature, electricity consumption is increasing daily in those regions of Ukraine where power supply has already been restored after massive missile strikes on November 15 on the energy infrastructure,"" said Ukrenergo in a statement issued Friday. ""This complicates the already difficult situation in the energy system."" Ukrenergo said it was restricting the use of electricity in some areas as ""a necessary measure to preserve the stability of the energy system,"" and had teams ""working around the clock to restore the damaged infrastructure in order to return light to Ukrainians."" Russian missile strikes hit critical infrastructure in cities across Ukraine this week, as many parts of Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, saw the first snowfall of the season on Thursday. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address Thursday that more than 10 million Ukrainians lacked electricity, and that most were in the Kyiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia and Sumy regions. Zelensky said crews were doing everything to normalize supply but there were ""emergency power cuts again in addition to the planned stabilization ones."" Yasno, a power supplier in Kyiv, said the city had experienced emergency blackouts all day Thursday, with the grid having less than half of its normal supply. Russian shelling and missile strikes hit civilian infrastructure in various parts of Ukraine overnight into Thursday. Zelensky said that dozens of people were wounded as a result of a missile strike in Dnipro, while in Zaporizhzhia seven bodies were recovered from the debris of a residential building destroyed by Russian shelling. A further two bodies were later found at the Zaporizhzhia site, bringing the toll to nine, his office said on Friday morning. Another three men were hospitalized after being wounded in missile strikes in Izium in the Kharkiv region. Several gas production facilities in eastern Ukraine were destroyed and others damaged by shelling, and the southern region of Odesa was also hit by Russian strikes on Thursday. Zelensky has accused Russia of ""energy terrorism"" over its repeated attacks on key infrastructure. ""The very fact that Russia has resorted to terror against the energy sector indicates the weakness of the enemy,"" Zelensky said during his nightly address on November 3. ""They cannot defeat Ukraine on the battlefield and therefore they are trying to break our people in this way."" The Russian defense ministry said Thursday's strikes targeted missile manufacturing facilities along with ""fuel and energy infrastructure"" associated with the military. ""An arsenal with artillery weapons supplied by Western countries, prepared for shipment to the troops, was destroyed,"" the ministry said Friday. ""The transfer of reserves of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the delivery of foreign weapons to the areas of hostilities have been disrupted.""",17,0.0,0.0,0.0,10
2022-11-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/europe/finland-border-fence-russia-intl/index.html,Finland plans to start building a fence on Russian border next year,"Finland, one of the few NATO countries sharing a border with Russia, has announced a proposal to spend 139 million euros ($143 million) on building barrier fences on its eastern border with Russia in 2023, the Finnish Border Guard said Friday. ""In the assessment of the Finnish Border Guard, the changed security environment has made it necessary to construct a barrier fence along part of the eastern border,"" the border guard said in a statement. ""If Russia reduces its border control, this may cause additional pressure at the Finnish end to control illegal entry. Finland cannot rely on the effectiveness of Russian border control,"" the statement said. The planned border fence will stretch for a distance of 130 to 260 kilometers (80 to 161 miles) -- only part of the 830-mile-long border it shares with Russia -- and will come with accompanying surveillance equipment and a patrol road as well. The construction of such a fence is expected to take three to four years and it can endure for roughly 50 years, according to the Finnish Border Guard. A pilot section will be built in Imatra starting in spring 2023. Helsinki has increasingly restricted crossings on the eastern border it shares with Russia. The Finnish border was one of the few entry points for Russians after many Western countries shut their air space and borders to Russian planes in response to the Ukraine invasion. It closed its border to Russia at the end of September, around the time traffic over the Finland-Russia land frontier intensified as Russians tried to flee Vladimir Putin's ""partial mobilization"" of hundreds of thousands of citizens to fight in the war. ""The Government deems that the Russian mobilization and the rapidly increasing volume of tourists arriving in Finland and transiting via Finland endanger Finland's international position and international relations,"" Finland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a statement at the time. It said while the ""resolution aims to stop tourism and related transit from Russia altogether"" it ""will not prevent traveling when it is deemed necessary for humanitarian reasons, for national interests or for meeting Finland's international obligations."" According to a November press release by the Finnish Border Guard, ""the amount of entries has decreased significantly after the restrictions came into force."" On September 29, some 8,583 Russian citizens crossed into Finland's eastern border from Russia. That figure dropped to 1,700 when border restrictions began on September 30, according to the border guard's statistics. On Friday, the Finnish Border Guard's head of international affairs Matti Pitkaniitty said on Twitter that the proposed barrier fence ""is much more than just a fence. It is whole new border infrastructure and new approach to border surveillance.",29,5.506014875493271,5.780530646930672,-0.27451577143740113,0
2022-11-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/europe/mh17-trial-verdict-intl/index.html,"Dutch court finds two Russians, one Ukrainian separatist guilty over downing of flight MH17","A Dutch court on Thursday found two Russians and a separatist Ukrainian guilty of mass murder for their involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014. Igor Girkin, a former colonel of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), and Sergey Dubinskiy, who worked for Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, were convicted along with Ukrainian separatist Leonid Kharchenko, who is believed to have led a combat unit in Donetsk in July 2014. The three were sentenced to life in prison and ordered to pay the victims more than 16 million euros, but as the convictions were handed down in absentia, none of them are likely to serve their sentences. A fourth suspect, Russian national Oleg Pulatov, a former soldier of the Russian special forces Spetsnaz-GRU, was acquitted. ""Causing the crash of Flight MH17 and the murders of all persons on board is such a serious accusation, the consequences are so devastating, and the attitude of the accused is so reprehensible, that a limited period of imprisonment will not suffice,"" the court said following the verdict. Flight MH17 was on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014, when it was shot out of the sky over territory held by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board were killed, including 15 crew members and 283 passengers from 17 countries. The downing of the jet happened in the early phase of the conflict between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian forces, a precursor to Moscow's full invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. Thursday's verdict, which follows a two-year trial at the highly secured Schiphol Judicial Complex in Badhoevedorp, marks the first time that independent judgment has been passed on the incident, and may provide some small amount of justice for the families of the victims. The case has become more significant in light of Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine, which is nearly in its ninth month. One legal expert told Reuters that the ruling could impact other cases involving Russia, including one at the United Nation's top court, the International Court of Justice. The verdict comes weeks after Moscow sought to illegally annex four Ukrainian regions, including the area where the court said the missile that brought down MH17 was fired from eight years earlier. It also comes two days after a missile landed in Poland, raising fears that Russia's assault on Ukraine could spill over into neighboring countries. A premeditated act The court found that Flight MH17 was hit by a Russian Buk missile launched from farmland outside a village in eastern Ukraine that was held at the time by pro-Russian rebels who were under the control of Moscow, and that the missile system had been moved back to Russia after the strike. The three convicted men all played key roles in and transporting the Buk system and its crew into Ukraine, the court ruled, though it found there was insufficient evidence to determine who fired the missile. Presiding judge Hendrik Steenhuis said the court found that the firing of the missile at MH17 was a premeditated act intended to bring down a plane -- and while the crew likely believed they were firing at a military aircraft, it would have been ""crystal clear"" to them that no one on board any targeted aircraft would survive. ""A Buk weapon system is designed to shoot down aircraft and cannot simply be used at random. Such deployment requires preparation, including determination of and transport to a launch site. Firing the missile needs to be very deliberate and carefully considered in accordance with a technical procedure and requires a highly trained crew. The likelihood of persons on board an aircraft surviving an attack by a Buk missile is nil. Anybody who deploys a specialized, costly weapon such as a Buk TELAR will be aware of this,"" the court said in a statement. The court also ruled that since the defendants were not official parties to the conflict and thus did not have combat immunity, they were not allowed to shoot down any aircraft, military or civilian. Moscow has repeatedly denied any responsibility for the attack, and Russian officials and state media have put out a range of often contradictory explanations for the tragedy. But on Thursday, Steenhuis cited a range of evidence for the court's verdict and ruled out any alternative explanations for the incident. The evidence reviewed by the court included fragments of a Buk missile found embedded in the aircraft and the bodies of some victims, intercepted telephone calls and witness statements, and videos and images of the scene and of a Buk system being moved into eastern Ukraine from Russia and then back again. The convicted men have a right to appeal. Moscow described the verdict as ""politically motivated"" and said it would not extradite the sentenced Russians to the Netherlands. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the verdict as an important moment for accountability. ""Holding to account masterminds is crucial too, as the feeling of impunity leads to new crimes. We must dispel this illusion. Punishment for all [Russia's] atrocities then & now is inevitable,"" he tweeted. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the United States welcomed the court's decision but that there was more work to do. ""While this is a solid step towards justice, more work lies ahead to meet the UN Security Council's demand in resolution 2166 that ""those responsible ... be held to account,"" Blinken said in a statement.",13,4.582058453593027,3.0911190972806284,1.4909393563123987,27
2022-11-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/europe/poland-missile-restraint-reaction-intl-hnk/index.html,"Poland acted with 'full restraint' after missile killed two people, ambassador tells UN","Poland's ambassador to the United Nations says the country acted with ""full restraint"" after a suspected Russian-made missile fell inside its border on Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens and sparking fears of an escalation in Russia's war against Ukraine. Speaking at the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday, Krzysztof Szczerski said Poland immediately launched an ""extensive multiphase investigation"" into the incident, which Warsaw and NATO said was likely caused by a missile fired by Ukrainian forces defending their country against Russian strikes. ""Poland is also conducting intensive consultations on the incident with its NATO allies and key partners,"" he said, noting that the incident prompted Poland to increase the combat readiness of a unit of the armed forces focused on airspace monitoring. Two farmers died when the missile caused an explosion outside the rural eastern Polish village of Przewodow, about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) west of the Ukrainian border. Tuesday's incident marks the first time a NATO country has been directly hit during the nearly nine-month conflict and prompted an emergency meeting of ambassadors from the US-led military alliance in Brussels Wednesday. Szczerski said the incident ""teaches us how close we actually live the potential escalation in the spillover of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine of far-reaching consequences that we all can perceive."" He added that the two Polish victims ""would not have been killed if there had been no Russian war against Ukraine."" ""Their only fault was the fact that they lived close to the civilian infrastructure on the Ukrainian side of the border that Russia keeps attacking as a military target,"" he said. NATO head Jens Stoltenberg said Russia bears ""ultimate responsibility"" for the incident, ""as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine."" The blast occurred roughly the same time as Russia launched its biggest wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities in more than a month, predominantly targeting energy infrastructure. The Polish ambassador repeated his country's early assessment that the incident appears to have been unintentional. ""The very initial findings support the hypothesis that the event was not a deliberate attack. But naturally, we need to wait for the final conclusion until the investigation is over,"" Szczerski told the UNSC. Investigations at the site where the missile landed will continue to be a joint operation with the United States, Polish President Andrzej Duda said Wednesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for Ukrainian experts to be allowed to the site. The US National Security Council said it has ""full confidence"" in the Polish investigation into the blast and that the ""party ultimately responsible"" for the incident is Russia for its ongoing invasion.",29,2.4412631234132056,5.029986123631459,-2.5887230002182533,10
2022-11-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/europe/russia-soldiers-desert-battlefield-intl-cmd/index.html,Anger on the front lines and anxiety at home as Russia's mobilization is mired in problems,"Russia's first mobilization since World War II may be complete, but the deployment of thousands of soldiers to the battlefields of Ukraine is generating dissent and protest on the front lines -- and back home. With the Russian government touting that at least 50,000 of the recently drafted are now in Ukraine, a long list of complaints is emerging: Lack of leadership from mid-ranking officers, tactics that lead to heavy casualties, non-existent training, promised payments not received. There are also logistical difficulties, as reported by soldiers, their families and Russian military bloggers: Insufficient uniforms, poor food, a lack of medical supplies. And there are discipline issues, with some families complaining their men face charges of desertion and are being held in basements in occupied Ukrainian territory. The Astra Telegram channel -- a project of independent Russian journalists -- reported that 300 mobilized Russians are being held in a basement in Zaitsevo in the Luhansk region for refusing to return to the front line, quoting their relatives. One woman said her husband had told her: ""New people are constantly brought in. They are in a large basement in the House of Culture in Zaitsevo. They feed them once a day: one dry ration to share between 5-6 people. They constantly threaten them."" Astra reported it had the names of 42 people of those detained. It also cited relatives in identifying seven basements or detention facilities in Luhansk and Donetsk for soldiers. It quoted the wife of one detained soldier as saying: ""My husband and 80 other people are sitting in the basement; they were stripped naked in order to confiscate their phones, but one person, fortunately, hid the phone."" Astra said the men were arrested after retreating from the town of Lyman and then refusing to return to the line of fire. CNN is unable to verify the existence or location of detention centers for men refusing to fight. There are widespread complaints about incompetent or non-existent leadership. Russian military bloggers -- some of whom have hundreds of thousands of followers -- have been bitterly critical of senior officers. ""Do we have generals capable of replacing those who have been sacked? Does anyone know one? I don't,"" asked Vladen Tatarskiy, who has more than half-a-million subscribers. ""One idiot is rotated for another. One fails, another fails, the third seems more harmless."" In a bold note of dissent, soldiers of the 155th Brigade of the Russian Pacific Fleet Marines wrote to their regional governor saying they'd been thrown into an ""incomprehensible battle"" in the Donetsk region. ""As a result of the 'carefully' planned offensive by the 'great commanders', we lost about 300 men, dead and wounded, with some MIA over the past 4 days,"" the letter said. It was published by a Russian military blogger and widely circulated. One prominent military blogger claimed the 155th and another unit ""lost twice as many men in Pavlivka"" -- in Donetsk region -- ""as during the two Chechnya wars."" In a rare acknowledgment of criticism, the Russian Defense Ministry retorted that losses did ""not exceed 1% of the combat strength and 7% of the wounded, a significant part of whom have already returned to duty."" But the reported debacle around Pavlivka is not an isolated incident. Kateryna Stepanenko, who tracks the Russian military at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, says: ""We have seen many complaints about unprepared mobilized men who were committed to the Svatove-Kreminna frontline [in Luhansk], which is currently one of the combat-heavy positions for Russian forces."" Protests back home As soldiers relay their plight back home, their complaints are being amplified by wives and mothers through social media and in direct appeals to regional authorities. Stepanenko says the ""most common complaints from these families are lack of information from the Ministry of Defense on the whereabouts of their loved ones, delayed payments, and lack of supplies."" Last week, video emerged from TV Rain, a Russian media outlet that now operates in exile, of servicemen's relatives gathered at a military base in the city of Boguchar in Voronezh region, many complaining that they'd not heard from husbands or sons since early October. In another video posted on the social network vk.com on Monday, a group of women in Voronezh said their husbands and sons were on the front line without commanders, without water, necessary clothing or weapons. One woman, Lyudmila Agarkova, said her son had told her that very few of his battalion had survived. ""They literally crawled out from under the corpses,"" she said. Appealing to the governor of Voronezh for help, the women say their men ""were not trained, they were taken to the firing range just once, they had no combat experience."" They also complain that they can't get answers, with one saying: ""We are a few minutes away from the military commissariat. None of the staff ever gets in touch, they completely ignore us."" A video posted on YouTube shows a dozen women reportedly from Sverdlovsk region, some with young children, appealing for help for recruits from the 55th brigade reportedly hiding out near Svatove in Luhansk. The families say their men have been threatened with military tribunals but argue they should not have been on the front line at all. One woman says her son had called, saying they were ""left without any command, without ammunition, hungry and cold, they are all ill."" ""They ended up there without any professional training,"" says another woman, whose 41-year old husband was mobilized. ""They don't get paid. They are not assigned to any military unit. Where to look for them, whom to ask, we don't know."" Occasionally, local authorities do respond. The military commissar of the Vladimir region, Yuri Gusarov, responded to relatives who said their men ""were sent to the front near Svatove without proper equipment and training."" ""Our military units have weapons, body armor, clothes, water, hot meals. Deliveries of aid from the Vladimir region are regular, communication with the commanders is maintained,"" the military commissar replied. More often than not, the families don't get a response. Journalist Anastasia Kashevarova, whose Telegram channel has more than 200,000 subscribers, said she'd received hundreds of messages from relatives of fighters. ""Groups are abandoned without communication, without the necessary weapons, without medicines, naturally without artillery. No one knows who is on their right, who is on the left, who is in the rear,"" she posted. ""Instead of being listened to, they are threatened with punishment, a tribunal, and sent back to the front line with four magazines of ammunition and a grenade launcher with a few shots."" CNN reached out to relatives of men in the 55th brigade from Tomsk and confirmed that they had met the local military command. But a day later, one woman texted: ""Apologies, but our lips have been sealed."" The moderator of one Telegram channel for families told CNN that mothers and wives often fear ""repressive retribution"" against their loved ones if they speak out. The moderator, who CNN is not identifying for their safety, said that at the local level ""some authorities are already calling them 'deserters,' without investigating why they were sent to Ukraine without training, equipment or command on the front line."" But complaining can come at a price. Olga Kuznetsova, a resident of Arkhangelsk, was found guilty of ""discrediting the Russian Armed Forces"" after collecting signatures against mobilization. She was fined 15,000 rubles ($250). Training deficit Western officials say the Russian war machine is struggling to assimilate tens of thousands of largely inexperienced recruits. The UK's Ministry of Defense said last week that ""Russia is probably struggling to provide military training for its current mobilization drive and its annual autumn conscription intake. Newly mobilized conscripts likely have minimal training or no training at all. Experienced officers and trainers have been deployed to fight in Ukraine and some have likely been killed in the conflict."" Ukrainian intelligence has reported that the Russian military is speeding up the graduations of cadets but Stepanenko says that ""while these cadets may be more familiar with military craft, it's hard to say how effective they will be in combat."" Ukrainian officials acknowledge that Russia's mobilization has put more men into battle, pulling Ukrainian troops in different directions. But they say new recruits are being thrown into battle with no preparation. Serhii Hayday, head of the Ukrainian Regional Military Administration in Luhansk, said last week that near Svatove, raw conscripts had advanced in waves. ""They die, and the next ones go forward. Every new attack is accompanied by the fact that the Russians are trampling their dead."" As winter sets in, the need for accommodation and supplies for troops far from home base is even more critical. Natalia Ivanova posted on the VKcontact page of a regional official that her husband's unit was kept waiting for hours outside, before the deployment was canceled. ""Now everyone is sick, with a temperature!"" she said. Stepananeko points to instances of protests among newly mobilized troops yet to be sent to Ukraine -- principally over pay -- ""with two notable examples being in Chuvashia and Ulyansk."" Video emerged earlier this month of dozens of men in Chuvashia, a republic in central Russia, angry that they had not received the 195,000 rubles promised in a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin. Unofficial Telegram channels said the whole unit had subsequently been placed under house arrest. Across Russia, relatives of the mobilized are also chasing unpaid compensation, for example, for buying uniform when it was not issued, with CNN finding many such posts on local government social media. Dozens of mobilized men in Kazan region protested due to poor conditions at their training ground and a lack of water, food and firewood for heating. In one video, a man is heard demanding that washing machines are installed. Then, he said, they ""would be happy to be in the mud every day from morning to evening."" It's too early to make a full assessment of the impact of Russia's mobilization of more than 300,000 men. That's double the number of men involved at the start of the Ukrainian invasion and would help plug gaps in units degraded by nine months of conflict. But the caliber of these troops, leadership in the field and a logistics chain that has never excelled do not bode well for the Russian army. Stepanenko thinks it's possible ""that more reports of deaths or lack of payments may upset more Russians -- both those who are pro-war and those who are only involved in the war because of mobilization."" For the moment, mobilization has",14,4.929653627013118,7.222149377743093,-2.292495750729975,24
2022-11-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/world/kyiv-strikes-russia-zelensky-peace-intl/index.html,Wave of Russian missiles hit Ukraine after Zelensky outlines conditions for peace at G20 summit,"Russia launched its biggest wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities in more than a month on Tuesday -- hours after Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky proposed a peace plan in front of world leaders at the G20 summit in Indonesia. Air raid sirens sounded out across Ukraine shortly after its leader outlined a 10-point plan including the withdrawal of Russian troops and the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity. The strikes targeted power infrastructure in several regions of the country, leaving more than seven million Ukrainians without power and the supply of electricity in a critical condition, according to senior Ukrainian officials. The deputy head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said that 15 facilities of Ukraine's energy infrastructure had been damaged during the Russian missile strikes, but Ukrainian air defenses had shot down 70 of more than 90 missiles fired at Ukraine. Two missiles or rockets also reportedly hit a farm in Poland near the border with Ukraine, killing two people, according to Polish media. It is unclear where the projectiles came from, but they landed roughly the same time as a Russian missile attack on western Ukraine. Two projectiles reportedly hit Poland around the same time as the Russian onslaught in Ukraine, with Polish media showing an image of a deep impact and upturned farm vehicle at the site, near the town of Przewodow. A government spokesman said that Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has convened the Committee of the Council of Ministers for National Security and Defense Affairs. Poland is a NATO member state, and the defense alliance is looking into the matter, a NATO official told CNN. Fellow NATO members the United States and the United Kingdom remained circumspect in their statements about the incident. A senior White House official said they do not have confirmation of any rocket or missile strike in Poland, but that US officials are currently working to try and figure out exactly what has happened. Zelensky in contrast blamed Russia for incident, which was echoed by NATO member Latvia. ""The terror is not limited to our national borders,"" Zelensky said in his daily address. Amid speculation over the projectiles' origin, Russia's Defense Ministry denied responsibility, saying there were ""no strikes made on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border."" Polish authorities also have not confirmed that Russian missiles landed in their territory. Power supplies disrupted in Ukraine At least a dozen cities and districts in Ukraine were targeted by Rusisan strikes, according to a CNN analysis of the missile strikes. The wave of strikes appears to be the largest since October 10, when Russia stepped up its campaign to destroy electricity, water and gas infrastructure across Ukraine. In a video message posted to Telegram on Tuesday evening local time, Zelensky said that 85 missile strikes had been launched against Ukraine so far, and warned there may be more to come. ""We can see what the enemy wants, they will not succeed,"" he said. ""We may yet have 20 more strikes, please look after yourselves, stay in shelter for some time."" In the capital, Kyiv, the city military administration said that one person had been killed. Two explosions had been heard, it added, instructing residents to remain in shelters. It said four missiles had been shot down. Kyiv mayor Vitaliy Klitschko then said there had been a third strike. ""Another hit in Pechersk district of Kyiv city. A high-rise building,"" Klitschko said. Power supplies were disrupted to several Ukrainian regions as a result of the missile strikes. State power supplier Ukrenergo said the Russians were ""trying to turn off the lights in the country again."" ""The attack is still ongoing, we cannot yet estimate the full extent of the damage, there are strikes on our infrastructure in all regions of the country, but the most difficult situation is in the northern and central regions,"" it added. In his video message, Zelensky said that authorities are working to restore power. ""We will withstand,"" he said. In addition the country ""is currently experiencing a major internet disruption,"" according to Netblocks, which tracks cybersecurity and connectivity around the world, with connectivity at 67% of previous levels. Neighboring Moldova also suffered power cuts following the Russian strikes on Ukraine, Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister and Infrastructure Minister Andrei Spinu said on Tuesday. Spinu said in a post on his Telegram account that ""following Russia's bombardment of the Ukrainian power system,"" one of the power lines carrying electricity to Moldova has been disconnected. Authorities are working to restore the connection to the line, which was not damaged but was disconnected as a safety measure, he added. Zelensky addresses G20 Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky set out a proposal for ending the Russian invasion, according to a transcript shared by the Embassy of Ukraine in Indonesia on Tuesday. The president's peace plan has 10 steps including a path to nuclear safety, food security, a Special Tribunal for Russian war crimes, and a final peace treaty with Russia, according to the speech transcript. He urged G20 leaders to use all of their power to ""make Russia abandon nuclear threats"" and implement a price cap on energy imported from Moscow. Zelensky also called on Russia to stop bombing Ukraine's energy infrastructure as winter approaches. ""Let Russia prove by its rejection of terror that it is really interested in the restoration of peace,"" he said. Moscow has been isolated at this year's G20 summit as multiple Western leaders vowed not to have any contact with its Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who is in attendance on behalf of the Kremlin. World leaders condemned Tuesday's strikes. At the summit, British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a tweet that the attacks targeting Ukrainian cities ""shows only Putin's weakness,"" who ""is losing on the battlefield and -- as we saw today at the G20 -- diplomatically too."" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said ""at the moment we are hearing again of brutal Russian missile attacks on Kyiv, Kharkiv and Lviv and other places, and especially again on civilian infrastructure,"" during remarks on Tuesday with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi in Berlin. She added that the attack ""is also an unprecedented attack on nuclear safety and nuclear security.""",17,4.551442046313488,1.3803143016823285,3.1711277446311597,10
2022-11-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/europe/poland-missile-rocket-nato-przewodow-ukraine-intl/index.html,World leaders hold emergency meeting as 'Russian-made' missile kills two in Poland,"World leaders gathering at the G20 summit in Bali are attempting to diffuse a potential escalation in the months-long Ukraine war after a ""Russian-made"" missile struck NATO-member Poland killing two people. The missile landed outside the rural Polish village of Przewodow, about four miles (6.4 kilometers) west from the Ukrainian border on Tuesday afternoon, roughly the same time as Russia launched its biggest wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities in more than a month. The circumstances surrounding the incident, which marks the first time a NATO country has been directly hit during the almost nine-month conflict, remain unclear. It is not known who fired the missile, or precisely where it was fired from, though the Polish Foreign Ministry has described it as ""Russian-made."" Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have used Russian-made munitions during the conflict, with Ukraine deploying Russian-made missiles as part of its air defense system. Speaking to reporters after holding an emergency meeting with G7 and NATO leaders on the sidelines of the G20 summit, US President Joe Biden said preliminary information suggested it was ""unlikely"" the missile was fired from within Russia, but was unable to say conclusively until the investigation was complete. ""We agreed to support Poland's investigation into the explosion ... And I'm going to make sure we figure out exactly what happened,"" Biden said, adding the leaders offered sympathy over the death of two people. ""Then we're going to collectively determine our next step as we investigate and proceed. There was total unanimity among the folks at the table,"" he added. Following Biden's statement, a NATO military official told CNN the missile had been tracked by an alliance aircraft flying above Polish airspace at the time of the blast. ""Intel with the radar tracks [of the missile] was provided to NATO and Poland,"" the NATO military official added. The NATO official did not say who launched the missile, or where it was fired from. The missile strike within Poland's borders on Tuesday ""would not have happened without Russia's horrific missile attacks against Ukraine,"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in a statement online Wednesday. ""The G7 and present NATO members convened a meeting this morning in Bali during the G20 to discuss the incident in Poland last night. We are united in our message that we first need to establish the facts and therefore support Poland's investigation,"" Rutte wrote. In comments earlier Tuesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda noted that while it was not clear who launched the missile, it was ""most likely"" made in Russia. ""We are working calmly and in a very calm manner,"" Duda said during an address from the Bureau of National Security in Warsaw. The Kremlin has denied involvement in the explosion, with Russia's Defense Ministry calling the reports by Polish media, who first reported the deaths,""a deliberate provocation in order to escalate the situation,"" according to a short statement late Tuesday. It added that the photos of wreckage published by Polish media ""from the scene in the village of Przewodow have nothing to do with Russian weapons."" The Russian mission at the United Nations on Wednesday said ""the incident in Poland is an attempt to provoke a direct military clash between NATO and Russia,"" adding the incident would be the focus of attention at the UN Security Council meeting later in the day. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Tuesday that evidence suggests the missile that landed in Przewodów was a ""single act"" and there is no evidence of further missile strikes. But while urging calm, Morawiecki said Poland would increase its military readiness and was contemplating the activation of Article 4 of the NATO Treaty. Article 4 is a consultation method that allows members of the 30-country alliance to bring an issue -- usually about security -- for discussion at the North Atlantic Council, its decision-making body. Whatever the outcome of the Polish-led investigation, the incident has reinforced longstanding concerns related to the risk of battlefield miscalculation triggering NATO-Russian conflict. Witness to the blast described hearing a terrifying ""whoosh"" as the projectile flew over the town and the force of the explosion shook nearby windows. Video taken by a resident, which was geolocated and confirmed by CNN, shows a large smoke plume in the center of the village. At the site of the explosion, local media showed an image of a crater and upturned farm vehicle. CNN cannot independently confirm the photos. In his address, Duda said the US would send experts to investigate the site as part of joint operation. Speaking after a call with Duda Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said it was ""important that all facts are established."" ""I offered my condolences for the loss of life. NATO is monitoring the situation and Allies are closely consulting. Important that all facts are established,"" said Stoltenberg in a statement.",29,2.218224619535248,4.594390331463213,-2.376165711927965,10
2022-11-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-wagner-group-mercenary-intl/index.html,Wagner Group boss and Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin applauds murder of former fighter,"Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose Wagner Group is heavily involved in the fighting in Ukraine, has applauded a video in which a former member of the group is brutally murdered. The video surfaced over the weekend on the Grey Zone Telegram channel, which frequently showcases the activities of mercenary fighters of the Wagner Group, which is accused of war crimes in Africa, Syria and Ukraine. It showed a member of the group who had deserted and gone over to the Ukrainian side being murdered with a sledgehammer. The man is named (and names himself in the video) as Yevgeny Nuzhin. In the video, Nuzhin says: ""On the 4th of September I carried out my plan by switching to fight alongside Ukrainian troops. On the 11th of November, I was on a street in Kyiv when someone hit me on the head and I lost consciousness."" He adds: ""I woke up in this cellar, where I was told that I will be judged."" Within seconds, he is killed, struck at least once with a sledgehammer. Prigozhin was asked on his Telegram channel about the killing. Without directly acknowledging that Wagner fighters had carried out the murder, he said: ""Nuzhin betrayed his people, betrayed his comrades, betrayed them consciously. He was not taken prisoner, nor did he surrender. Rather, he planned his escape. Nuzhin is a traitor."" ""Russian people can smell betrayal -- it's genetic. Hence the comments on social networks,"" said Prigozhin, referring to some positive responses to the killing. In a separate Telegram post Prigozhin called the video ""an excellent director's work."" ""I prefer to watch this story in the theatre. As for the executed, in this show it is clear that he did not find happiness in Ukraine, but instead met with unkind, although fair people. It seems to me that this film is called ""The dog receives the dog's death."""" Text on the Gray Zone channel accompanying the video said that ""the sledgehammer and traitors have a close relationship for the 'orchestra' [ie Wagner]. And now, suddenly disappearing from the investigation in Kyiv, the traitor received the traditional primordial Wagnerian punishment."" 'How can you wage war with your own family?' In early September, Nuzhin was interviewed by Ukrainian journalist Yuriy Butusov, and spoke about surrendering to Ukrainian forces and his readiness to fight on the side of Kyiv. Nuzhin also spoke of how the Wagner group recruits prisoners to fight in Ukraine in exchange for the promise of a full pardon in Russia. In early October, Nuzhin gave another interview to Ukrainian journalist Ramina Eskhakzai expressing his support for Ukraine and revealing more details about how the Wagner group operates. In the interview, Nuzhin confirmed he had spent 23 years in jail in Nizhny Novgorod for murder. He was due to be released in 2027 but chose to join the Wagner group to fight in Ukraine. He also told Eskhakzai: ""My parents live in the western Ukraine. How can you wage war with your own family? "" On Sunday, Vladimir Osechkin, head of Gulagu.net, a prisoner advocacy group, said on his blog that he had interviewed the sons of Nuzhin, who confirmed it was their father in the video. It's still unclear how Nuzhin ended up in captivity. CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian authorities, asking whether Nuzhin was sent back to Russian-held territory in return for the liberation of Ukrainian prisoners of war, or whether he was abducted without their knowledge. On Friday, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, said in a statement that 45 Ukrainian soldiers had returned from captivity in another round of prisoner exchanges. Anastasia Kashevarova, a former adviser to the head of the Russian State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin, said the exchange included fighters from the Wagner company, but she did not identify them. Asked about the video Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""We have no comment. We don't know what it is, how true it is. This is not our business."" Prigozhin is reportedly one of Putin's trusted confidants -- so close that the Russian press dubbed him the ""chef"" to the Russian President after he began catering events for the Kremlin. In September, he admitted to founding the Wagner Group after years of denying involvement with the outfit.",13,4.361059487507115,5.60049870737339,-1.2394392198662754,3
2022-11-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/europe/kherson-zelensky-war-crimes-intl/index.html,Zelensky visits Kherson after accusing Russia of committing hundreds of war crimes,"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenksy made a surprise visit to Kherson Monday to offer support to residents of the newly recaptured city, where investigators have begun to uncover possible proof of wartime atrocities committed during the months-long occupation by Russian forces. Zelensky said in his nightly address Sunday that officials had uncovered evidence of more than 400 war crimes. Russian forces, Zelensky alleged, left behind a trail of devastation and dead bodies in the wake of their hasty evacuation, similar to what Ukrainian officials found in April in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, and Borodianka, a city east of the Ukrainian capital. ""The situation in the Kherson region is still very dangerous,"" Zelensky said. Just hours later, Zelensky was in the eponymous regional capital to speak with local officials. He told reporters that it was important to travel to Kherson, noting that Ukrainian servicemen and journalists on the ground were taking similar risks. ""I think it is necessary to be here and talk about Kherson residents, to support people. To make them feel that we are not only talking about it, but we are really returning, really raising our flag,"" he said. Russia's military ordered its forces to evacuate from Kherson on Wednesday. On Friday, Moscow said it had withdrawn from the west bank of the strategically important Dnipro River, ceding large swathes of land that it had occupied since the early days of the war -- effectively handing over Kherson city and its surrounding areas to the Ukrainians. Ukrainian forces who entered the city on Saturday were greeted by jubilant residents cheering them and asking for autographs. A crowd of locals gathered in Kherson's main square to sing the national anthem, while others shouted ""Slava Ukrayini!"" -- glory to Ukraine, a patriotic greeting. Zelensky said about 70,000 to 80,000 people were still living in Kherson. The retreat represents a major blow for Putin's war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February's invasion, though it was one of the few regions where residents dared to protest against the Kremlin. The region of Kherson is also one of four Ukrainian territories that Russia attempted to annex in violation of international law. Fewer than fives weeks ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed people living in these areas would be Russian citizens ""forever."" When asked about Zelensky's visit, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""No comment. This is Russian territory."" Danger remains Though Russia has retreated from the city, Kherson is now a city on the front lines of the war. Russian forces are now stationed just kilometers away, on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River. Ukraine's military said Monday that Russian forces were conducting more aerial reconnaissance of Kherson, which could portend future airstrikes. The most immediate issue, Ukrainian police said Saturday, was mines and explosives left behind by the Russian military. Zelensky said Sunday that one sapper was killed and four others were injured in de-mining operations. A family of four -- including an 11-year-old child -- was also injured in a mine-related accident, a top Ukrainian official said Sunday. Life inside the city remains difficult. Residents are without power and internet, and food and drinking water remain in short supply. The first aid convoys began to arrive in the city on Monday, a volunteer official said. Critical infrastructure, including an important nearby dam, remain damaged and require repairs before coming back online. Yaroslav Yanushevych, the head of the Kherson region military administration and Ukraine's top official in the region, said all four power lines that supply electricity to the city had been destroyed. ""We are working on solving this problem day and night,"" Yanushevych told reporters while appearing beside Zelensky on Monday. ""The power will be restored in the near future."" Kherson is one of many parts of Ukraine facing wartime power shortages. Since the end of summer, Russian forces have targeted energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine, crippling Kyiv's ability to keep the lights and heat on as winter approaches. Zelensky said such attacks amount to ""energy terrorism."" ""The coming months will be difficult. Putin's aim is to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter so we must stay the course,"" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday. ""We should not make the mistake of underestimating Russia.""",14,5.156045132494206,1.086496699313585,4.06954843318062,8

Crowds celebrated the liberation of the city Saturday after Ukrainian forces swept into the city and Russian troops retreated to the east. But life remains far from normal, with authorities warning residents to be wary of explosives littering the city, and Russian forces still nearby -- just across the strategically important Dnipro River. This is not the end of the struggle against the Russian occupation in the country, reports CNN's Nic Robertson, who witnessed emotional scenes Saturday in Kherson's central square as residents hailed their liberation. ""Kherson is now a front line city,"" he said. ""Last night and in the early hours of this morning you could hear outgoing fire towards the Russian forces."" On Saturday, Ukraine's National Police warned ""the main threat at the moment is mass mining,"" with a police representative injured while demining one of the city's administrative buildings. Almost 2,000 ""explosive items,"" such as mines, trip wires, and unexploded ammunition, have already been removed from the Kherson region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned during his nightly address Saturday. He urged Kherson residents ""to be careful and not try to independently check any buildings and objects left by the occupiers."" ""There are 10 groups of bomb disposal experts working in Kherson, the police are working, and there are various units of the defense forces,"" Zelensky said. Meanwhile, the makings of a dire humanitarian situation are unfolding in the city, where power is out and access to food and water is limited. ""There is practically no water supply in the town. There is a shortage of medicines, there is a shortage of bread, which is not produced because of the lack of electricity. There are also problems with food supplies,"" Roman Golovnya, adviser to the mayor of Kherson, said in a TV broadcast Saturday. Damage to major dam Infrastructure has taken an unwelcome hit: Zelensky said that ""before fleeing from Kherson, the occupiers destroyed all critical infrastructure -- communication, water supply, heat, electricity."" Weather conditions are getting tougher, with sub-zero temperatures at night, CNN's team in Kherson city reports, and no heating in the city. Ukrainian authorities have said that those who find it too hard to live in Kherson can move to other parts of the country, since they do now have freedom of movement. Meanwhile, damage has been inflicted on a critical dam that spans the Dnipro River at Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies obtained by CNN on Friday showed water flowing out of three sluice gates at the dam, where a major hydroelectric project is situated. On Sunday, Vladimir Leontie, a Russian-installed official in Nova Kakhovka, alleged on Russian state TV that the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant had received ""enormous"" damage as a result of shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces, with repairs to take at least a year. Pro-Russian officials in the annexed Kherson region claim that the evacuation of civilians and the retreat of Russian troops from the west bank to the east bank of Dnipro River is due to the threat of flooding that could occur if the Ukrainian military hits the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam. Ukraine has not said it was the party which shelled the plant. Methodical operation to clear city Speaking Saturday on the next steps for the Ukrainian military in Kherson, CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton said: ""This is going to be a major urban operation. What you are going to see is a methodical operation to clear buildings of potential booby traps and mines. ""Another thing that the Ukrainians will have to do is they're going to have to move their systems forward so that they can counter any possible Russian artillery that is going to be on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River. ""You can see that the Ukrainians have moved to that river bank, they are now controlling that area, they will have to mop up some remaining Russian forces that did not make it out of the west bank of the Dnipro River. But those that are there will probably either surrender or in essence be eliminated from the fight."" Russian troops are focusing their efforts in the Kherson region on equipping their defensive lines on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, an operational update from the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) General Staff said Sunday night. Russia announced Friday that it had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of the same name and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians. The retreat represents a major blow for Putin's war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February's invasion. Their withdrawal east across the Dnipro cedes large swathes of land that Russia has occupied since the early days of the war, and that Putin had formally declared as Russian territory just five weeks ago. The Ukrainian military said Sunday the Russians were still conducting assaults in the Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlikvka areas, all in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region. Other areas like Kupyansk and Lyman are also getting hit by artillery, the AFU added.",14,0.9630103853507782,1.1304331801406802,-0.16742279478990196,8

But on Friday, Ukrainian forces swept into the city and Russian troops retreated to the east. The residents have no water, no internet connection and little power. But as a CNN crew entered the city on Saturday, the mood was euphoric. As the crew filmed live in Kherson's central square, some in the crowd of locals sang the national anthem while others shouted ""Slava Ukrayini!"" -- glory to Ukraine, a patriotic greeting. ""We feel free, we are not slaves, we are Ukrainians,"" resident Olga told CNN. Locals have also been climbing onto the tops of the buildings, including the cinema, in the square to erect Ukrainian flags. Soldiers driving through are greeted with cheers and asked to sign autographs on flags. Back when Russian troops rolled in at the beginning of the war, this was a city that tried to resist: people were taken away, tortured, disappeared, residents said. ""We were terrified by [the] Russian army, we were terrified by soldiers that can come any moment in our house, in our home -- just open the door, like they are living here, and steal, kidnap, torture,"" Olga said. But now, people flock to the central square in the newly liberated city, wrapped in Ukrainian flags, singing and chanting ""Freedom for Ukraine."" ""Everyone here is out celebrating in the square here. People are wearing the Ukrainian flag, they're hugging the soldiers, they've come out to see what it's like to have freedom,"" Robertson said. Katerina described the liberation as the ""best day"" of her life after eight months under Russian occupation. ""Our town is free, my street is free,"" she told CNN. Another local resident named Andrew said he was so glad to see Ukrainian soldiers. ""I think lots of people were killed here. We just don't know that yet,"" he said of the period under occupation. A Ukrainian Special Forces soldier, who gave his name only as Daniel, told CNN how his unit was the first to arrive in Kherson. ""My commander put the flag on the top of the building,"" he said. ""It was a real blast for us, finally. Before the 11th [of November], it was five days of hard work, real hard work. Ukrainian soldiers, as always, just confirmed again that they are stronger than the Russians."" He added that the civilians in Kherson are the ""real heroes"" for lasting so long under Russian occupation. ""I can't imagine how happy they are right now,"" he said. The CNN team appeared to be the first international journalists to reach Kherson city center since it changed hands in the past 48 hours.

The woman said it felt ""amazing"" to see Ukrainian troops in Kherson. ""We felt every day your support, thank you so much,"" the woman added, before hugging Robertson. Efforts to return the city to 'normal life' Ukrainian authorities are working to return the city to ""normal life,"" the head of the regional military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevich, said Saturday in a video message, adding that the city, oblast and district military administrations had arrived in the city and started duties. ""The national police and the security service of Ukraine have also taken up their duties. The State Service for Emergency Situations is clearing mines. We are working for the return of the city to normal life,"" Yanushevich said. About 200 police officers are currently working in the city, Ukraine's National Police said in a statement Saturday. ""Roadblocks have been set up around and in the territory of Kherson. The regional police continue to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers,"" the statement reads. The main threat is from mines, police said, adding that explosives technicians were working on their detection and disposal. ""One of the police sappers was injured today during the demining of an administrative building in Kherson,"" police said.

Elated civilians who had survived months of Russian occupation descended on Kherson's central square, hugging newly arrived Ukrainian soldiers, snapping selfies with them, and waving Ukrainian flags. Footage of the jubilant scenes emerged hours after Russia announced it had withdrawn from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the strategic southern region of Kherson, leaving the regional capital of Kherson and surrounding areas to the Ukrainians. The retreat represents a major blow for Putin's war effort in Ukraine. Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February's invasion.

On Friday evening, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a night-time video of celebrations in Kherson city, where a crowd was waving flags and chanting ""ZSU,"" the Ukrainian acronym for the armed forces. He called it ""a historic day"" for Ukraine. ""We are returning the south of our country, we are returning Kherson."" ""As of now, our defenders are on the outskirts of the city. Just a little more to go and we will enter. But special units are already in the city,"" Zelensky said. Zelensky appealed to any Russian soldiers still on the west bank to surrender. ""We guarantee that you will be treated in accordance with the law and international standards. And to those Russian military who disguised themselves in civilian clothes and are hiding somewhere, I want to say that you cannot hide. We will find you anyway,"" he said. Ukrainian forces advanced through much of the Kherson region Friday, apparently encountering little or no resistance. Social media video from towns and villages throughout the region's west bank shows troops being greeted by civilians. Russia's Defense Ministry announced earlier on Friday that its forces have completed their partial withdrawal from the Kherson region, after Moscow ordered the retreat Wednesday, ""In the Kherson direction, the move of Russian military units to the left bank of the Dnieper River was completed at 0500 [Moscow time] this morning,"" the ministry said on its official Telegram channel, using the Russian spelling for the river. ""Not a single piece of military equipment or weaponry was left behind on the right [west] bank,"" the statement added. ""All Russian servicemen have moved to the left bank of the Dnieper."" Social media video suggests otherwise, with Russian tanks, armored vehicles and crates of ammunition displayed by Ukrainian troops. Ukraine has asserted that it carried out attacks against Russian troop concentrations that were withdrawing, but the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement later on Friday that ""despite the attempts of the enemy to disrupt the transfer of Russian troops, no losses among personnel, weapons, military equipment and materiel were allowed."" It also claimed that the Ukrainian advance had been held back for several days, and that ""manpower and military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the right bank of the Dnieper are being hit by fire."" Ukraine has not reported any incoming fire from the east bank Friday but said a missile attack on the city of Mykolaiv, close to the border with Kherson, killed seven people early Friday. Earlier Friday, the Ukrainian military's southern operational command said Russian forces had been ""urgently loading into boats that seem suitable for crossing and trying to escape"" across the river. It was unclear whether all Russian troops had left Kherson and the wider region; Khlan said the city was ""almost under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine"" but warned that some Russian troops may have remained behind in civilian clothing. He cautioned that many Russian troops ""threw away their military uniforms, and are now hiding with civilian clothes on."" ""They will be plotting provocations, false-flag operations in the city,"" he said. ""There is a lot of work ahead on demining and clearing the city."" Residents of Kherson city with whom CNN has spoken in recent weeks confirmed that many Russian soldiers were using civilian clothing. Ukraine's military said it would proceed cautiously through Kherson region, and warned Russian troops were mining roads and destroying critical infrastructure as they retreated from the region. ""The Russian invaders continue their looting of settlements from which they are retreating,"" spokesman for the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces Oleksandr Shtupun said. ""The enemy is also trying to damage power lines, other transport and critical infrastructure facilities of Kherson region."" Images and video on social media Friday also showed that the Antonivskyi Bridge, the main conduit over the Dnipro in the Kherson region, had been destroyed. At least seven bridges in total, four of them crossing the River Dnipro, have been destroyed in the last 24 hours, Maxar Technologies satellite images and other photos show. Two bridges, a vehicle and a railroad, that sit atop a dam at Nova Kakhovka were among those destroyed. Water is flowing out of three sluice gates at the critical dam, which spans the Dnipro river, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies obtained by CNN. It's unclear how the latest damage, which is close to the west bank, was caused. Local Telegram channels reported Thursday night the sound of explosions around the dam. Ukrainian forces do not appear they have taken control of the dam, which could cause considerable damage in the region if breached. Alexander Kots, a reporter for the Russian pro-government tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda embedded with Russian forces, posted a video on his Telegram channel standing on the crossing, showing the entire center section of the bridge destroyed. ""Behind me are the two collapsed spans of (the) bridge,"" Kots said. ""They were likely blown up during the withdrawal of the Russian group of forces from the right bank to the left,"" or western bank to eastern bank. Sweeping losses Russian forces have ceded about 40% of the Kherson region, which straddles the Dnipro, within a few days. Now that Ukrainian forces have recaptured Kherson as far as the Dnipro river, the two sides face each other across the river over a distance of some 250 kilometers -- from the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the edge of the Black Sea. As Russian forces have fled, Ukrainian troops have pushed forward in their wake, capturing dozens of villages and settlements in Kherson region above the Dnipro. The Ukrainian military on Friday recaptured another part of Kherson region, the village of Tyahinka near the strategic town of Nova Kakhovka, despite Russian forces destroying bridges to the village. A video circulating on social media on Friday, geolocated and authenticated by CNN, showed Ukrainian forces being greeted by residents on the main highway in Tyahinka. The village is just 14 miles (20 km) west of the hydroelectric dam and bridges that stretch across the Dnipro river at Nova Kakhovka. A number of photos, also geolocated and authenticated by CNN, show that the Ukrainian forces were able to make their way into the village despite the main highway's bridge and a pedestrian bridge being destroyed by the Russians as they withdrew. Dozens of bridges across the Kherson region have been destroyed or disabled during the conflict. Residents of the town of Bilozerka, on the western outskirts of Kherson city, raised a Ukrainian flag and ripped down Russian propaganda billboards on Friday, according to videos on social media geolocated by CNN. One video showed a Ukrainian flag flying over a World War II memorial, while another showed residents tearing down a propaganda billboards with a young girl holding a Russian flag, which read: ""Russia is here forever."" The scenes of people greeting Ukrainian troops across the region were in sharp contrast to claims by Russian-appointed officials in Kherson six weeks ago that 87% of voters there supported integration into the Russian Federation, in a referendum widely condemned by the international community as a sham. Kherson was one of four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Russia in September. Kyiv officials had warned that retreating Russian troops could turn the regional capital of Kherson into a ""city of death"" on the way out, and an official in southern Ukraine warned residents Friday to be wary of quickly returning to recently liberated territory due to the threat of mines. ""There are a lot of mines in the liberated territories and settlements,"" Vitaliy Kim, head of Mykolaiv region military administration, said on Telegram. ""Don't go there for no reason. There are casualties."" Putin's spokesperson on Friday insisted that the region remains part of Russia, despite the Russian withdrawal. ""This is a subject of the Russian Federation,"" Dmitry Peskov said during a regular briefing with journalists. ""It has been legally fixed and defined. There can be no changes here."" Russia still controls a large portion of the Kherson region -- the area east of the Dnipro River. When asked directly whether Russia's retreat was ""humiliating"" for President Vladimir Putin, Peskov replied: ""No.""",14,0.9694676072958888,2.276803211012339,-1.30733560371645,8

Here's what it means for the war,"Scenes of jubilation broke out in Ukraine's southern Kherson city on Friday as Ukrainian forces advanced through much of the city and its surrounding area, apparently encountering little or no resistance as they regained the only regional capital captured by Russia this year. Russian forces have retreated to the east bank of the Dnipro River, which cleaves through the wider region, also called Kherson, that was annexed by Russia in September in violation of international laws. The withdrawal is another humiliating setback for Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and the most significant military moment in the war since Ukrainian forces swept through the northern Kharkiv region in September. What just happened? The Russian withdrawal was ordered on Wednesday during a choreographed meeting in Moscow between Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Sergey Surovikin, the commander of Russia's forces in Ukraine, which was shown on Russian state media. In leaving the western half of Kherson, the Russians have pulled back from thousands of square kilometers, including some of Ukraine's best farmland, which it has occupied since the early days of the invasion. Surovikin said that the withdrawal would protect the lives of civilians and troops -- who have faced a punishing Ukrainian counteroffensive that targeted Russian ammunition depots and command posts, hampering their supply lines. Russian forces have now ceded about 40% of the Kherson region, which straddles the Dnipro, within a few days. Now that Ukrainian forces have recaptured Kherson as far as the Dnipro river, the two sides face each other across the river over a distance of some 250 kilometers (155 miles) -- from the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the edge of the Black Sea. What it means for Russia The withdrawal -- while presented as a prudent military move to save resources and allow them to be deployed to other fronts -- nevertheless deals a blow to Moscow's campaign in Ukraine. Just weeks ago Kherson region was annexed, illegally incorporated into the Russian Federation. Now about 10,000 square kilometers of land are back in Ukrainian hands, and Ukraine's accurate Western-supplied artillery is within range of Crimea. Russia still however retains control of about 60% of the Kherson region, south and east of the Dnipro, including the coastline along the Sea of Azov. So long as Moscow's troops control and fortify the Dnipro's east bank, Ukrainian forces will struggle to damage or disrupt the canal that carries fresh water to Crimea. Moving to the east bank will make it easier for Russia to replenish its troops and regain defense in depth. Any attempt by Ukrainian forces to cross the Dnipro would be costly to the point of prohibitive, as Russian forces are well dug in along a stretch of the river. Pillbox guardhouses have become a common sight; trenches appeared on satellite imagery and civilians were unceremoniously removed from homes close to the river. In Moscow, some hawkish commentators have lamented the withdrawal as a humiliation and an embarrassment. But others who were previously critical of the Defense Ministry have accepted the move. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said Surovikin had saved a thousand soldiers and ""made a difficult but right choice between senseless sacrifices for the sake of loud statements and saving the priceless lives of soldiers."" Kadyrov added that Kherson was a difficult place to fight, especially without guaranteed resupply routes. What it means for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed Friday as ""a historic day"" for Ukraine. ""We are returning the south of our country, we are returning Kherson,"" Zelensky said. The Ukrainian military's fresh success, on the heels of a lightning fast advance across much of Kharkiv in September, will help reinforce international support for Ukraine's war effort, even as US officials are urging Zelensky to soften his rhetoric on negotiations, if not his core demands. Success in Kherson may also allow exhausted Ukrainian units some respite, as well as allow redirected focus on Donbas, where fierce fighting continues in both Luhansk and Donetsk. But Russia has plenty of weaponry and tens of thousands of newly mobilized troops to send into battle, and its campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure has left power and water supplies hanging by a thread in many regions. Ukraine is slowly receiving advanced air defenses from Western donors but has a huge area to defend. Ukranian authorities also have a massive task of reconstruction ahead in Kherson, where Russian forces destroyed critical infrastructure and left a huge number of mines behind. On Friday, Maxar Technologies satellite images and other photos showed at least seven bridges, four of them crossing the Dnipro, have been destroyed in the last 24 hours. New damage has also appeared on a critical dam that spans the Dnipro in the Kherson region city of Nova Kakhovka, on the east bank of the river. For weeks, both sides have accused the other of planning to breach the dam, which if destroyed would lead to extensive flooding on the east bank and deprive the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia of water to cool its reactors. Ukraine laid the groundwork for its victory in Kherson back in the summer, with relentless long-distance attacks on Russian supply depots, railway hubs and bridges. It is using the same tactic now in Luhansk. Events in Kherson and Kharkiv have shown that the Ukrainians possess tactical agility that seems alien to the Russian way of war, as well as far superior battlefield intelligence. Russia's merciless bombardments, especially in Donetsk and Luhansk, have undoubtedly killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers since the invasion began. But it's hard to envision such a blunt instrument achieving Putin's goal of reaching the borders of Luhansk and Donetsk -- especially as Ukraine has now changed the front lines in the south to such advantage.",14,1.5998782085107985,0.483252310382345,1.1166258981284536,8
2022-11-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/europe/russia-withdrawal-kherson-ukraine-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,Russia's withdrawal from half of Kherson is both humiliating and unsurprising,"Russia's Defense Ministry says its troops are preparing to withdraw from a large part of the occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson, in a move that's humiliating but also -- after the developments of recent weeks -- unsurprising. The plan would give up thousands of square kilometers (including some of Ukraine's best farmland) that Russia has occupied since the early days of the invasion, and was formally declared its territory just five weeks ago. At a choreographed meeting in Moscow on Wednesday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Sergey Surovikin -- the recently appointed commander of what Moscow refers to as its ""Special Military Operation"" in Ukraine -- put the best possible face on the withdrawal. Since August, Russian troops have killed 9,500 Ukrainian soldiers in Kherson and successfully repelled ""up to 80% to 90% of enemy missiles,"" Surovikin claimed. Nevertheless, a retreat would protect the lives of civilians and troops, he said. ""I understand that this is a very difficult decision, but at the same time we will preserve the most important thing -- the lives of our servicemen and the overall combat capability of the grouping of troops, which is futile to keep on the right (west) bank in a limited area,"" Surovikin said. Russian commentators and officials have carefully avoided the word retreat, spinning the ""withdrawal"" as a smart military call to regroup on the eastern side of the river Dnipro, in defensible positions that Ukrainian forces would struggle to destroy. It's not known at this stage how the Ukrainians will respond. Their troops on the southern front lines are exhausted and the land ahead of them is likely to be heavily mined. Pursuing the Russian troops would shed more blood, as would any fighting in dense areas like Kherson city. Ukraine will ""move very carefully, without emotions, without unnecessary risk,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late on Wednesday in his daily video message. ""We are gradually moving to the south, strengthening our positions. Step by step,"" he said. The announcement in Moscow did not provoke the chest-thumping that accompanied previous reversals. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has often been critical of the Defense Ministry and the high command, said Surovikin had saved a thousand soldiers and ""made a difficult but right choice between senseless sacrifices for the sake of loud statements and saving the priceless lives of soldiers."" Kadyrov added that Kherson was a difficult place to fight, especially without guaranteed resupply routes. In the summer, when Ukraine received longer-range rockets such as the US HIMARS, it set about degrading as many river bridges, railroad hubs and supply depots deep behind Russian lines as it could reach. The Russians resorted to pontoon bridges -- even submerging railway cars -- but getting munitions and other supplies across the Dnipro became increasingly difficult. But not everyone accepted the Kherson withdrawal with equanimity. Hawkish Russian commentator Sergey Markov described the planned relinquishment of Kherson on his Telegram channel as ""the largest geopolitical defeat of Russia since the collapse of the USSR. The political consequences of this huge defeat will be really big."" ""The main reason for this defeat is the rejection of a real war and the catastrophic delay in making the necessary decisions,"" he continued. Kadyrov seemed to agree that delays had whittled down Moscow's options. Fighting in Kherson required ""a stable regular supply of ammunition and the formation of a strong, reliable rear,"" he said. ""Why was this not done from the first days of the special operation?"" Back in October, when Surovikin got the job as overall commander of the operation, he warned that difficult choices must be faced. The Kharkiv debacle -- which saw Ukrainian forces sweep across much of the region in one week -- predated his appointment, and he may have been wary that Kherson could quickly become another embarrassment. On October 18, in an interview with Russian state news agency TASS, Surovikin said that plans for Kherson would depend on the ""evolving military-tactical situation,"" which he described as ""already very difficult."" ""We will act consciously, in a timely manner, not excluding the adoption of difficult decisions,"" he said. Discretion, it seems, became the better part of valor. Over the past two weeks, Russian forces have dug in on the east bank. Pillbox guardhouses have become a common sight; trenches appeared on satellite imagery and civilians were unceremoniously removed from homes close to the river. What happens if Russia withdraws If and when Russian troops do withdraw to the east bank, their supply lines will become easier and they will regain defense in depth. Any attempt by Ukrainian forces to cross the Dnipro would be costly to the point of prohibitive. Russia would retain control of 60 per cent of the Kherson region, including the coastline along the Sea of Azov. So long as Moscow's troops control and fortify the Dnipro's east bank, Ukrainian forces will struggle to damage or disrupt the canal that carries fresh water to Crimea. Surovikin's priority appears to be stabilizing Russia's defensive lines after a difficult few months. He made the point on Wednesday that the forces being pulled out of Kherson ""will be used for active operations, including offensive ones, in other directions in the operation zone."" There is always a chance that the Moscow meeting on Wednesday was designed to lure Ukrainian forces into a trap, and that the Russians don't intend to abandon the west bank altogether. Senior Ukrainian officials have certainly been skeptical. But the tactical situation for Russian forces, pushed into a shrinking pocket above the river, has gone from challenging to near-impossible in weeks. The larger political failure in Kherson can't be camouflaged. Russian-appointed officials have run Kherson city and environs since March. They have distributed Russian passports to anyone who would have one, talked about the ruble replacing the Ukrainian hryvnia, and organized the wholesale theft of grain. Senior officials arrived from Moscow to discuss Kherson's integration into the ""Russian world."" And then there was the illegal and implausible referendum in September, followed by the pomp of the ceremony in Moscow annexing Kherson and three other regions. On September 30, Putin said he had a message for Kyiv. ""People living in Luhansk and Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are becoming our citizens. Forever."" ""We will defend our land with all the powers and means at our disposal."" There again, a week is a long time in politics. The celebrations orchestrated by Putin little over a month ago have been confounded in one region, just as Ukrainian forces begin to make inroads in Luhansk as well.",14,1.0662185856511606,1.5159249453212265,-0.4497063596700659,8
2022-11-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/europe/kherson-gains-russia-retreat-intl/index.html,"Ukraine claims big gains in south, but fears retreating Russians will turn Kherson into 'city of death'","Ukraine's military said it had retaken swathes of territory in Kherson on Thursday after Moscow ordered a partial withdrawal from the area, though officials in Kyiv warned that retreating Russian soldiers could turn the regional capital into a ""city of death"" on their way out. A military spokesman said that in just 24 hours, Ukrainian forces had pushed the front line in the key southern region of Kherson forward by 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) and taken control of more than 260 square kilometers of territory (100 square miles). Kyiv said it took control of the towns of Snihurivka and Kyselivka, both of which sit along key roads leading into Kherson city, the regional capital. Kyselivka is located about 15 kilometers (9 miles) away from Kherson city. Moscow on Wednesday said its troops would withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro River, an area that includes Kherson city, in one of the biggest military setbacks for Russia since its invasion began. A spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry said that effort began the following day. Officials in Kyiv, however, have treated the announcement with skepticism. Kherson is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia attempted to annex in violation of international law, and some doubt that Moscow would give up fighting for a territory filled with people that Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed would be Russian citizens ""forever."" Ukrainian officials are also concerned that the Russian military will embrace scorched earth tactics and leave behind a trail of devastation in the wake of their withdrawal. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, alleged Thursday that Russia ""wants to turn Kherson into a 'city of death.'"" The Russian military ""mines everything they can: apartments, sewers. Artillery on the left [eastern] bank plans to turn the city into ruins. This is what 'Russian world' looks like: came, robbed, celebrated, killed 'witnesses,' left ruins and left,"" Podolyak tweeted. Ukraine military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov said Russian forces were continuing to shell areas recaptured by the Ukrainian military and attempted to strike humanitarian aid distribution points. However, signs of the retreat have begun to emerge. Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Washington had seen the ""beginnings"" of a Russian withdrawal in Kherson. Satellite imagery taken last week of Russian-occupied Crimea showed trenches being dug near the border with Kherson, a possible sign that Russian military leaders are nervous about the progress of Ukraine's counteroffensive. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said more than 41 settlements in southern Ukraine have been liberated following Russia's decision to move to the eastern side of the Dnipro river. He added that police units had moved into several settlements in Kherson to begin stabilization measures, but the liberation of Ukrainian territory was just the first step in a long process. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said Kyiv's military success in Kherson left Russia with ""no other option but to resort to fleeing."" When asked if the withdrawal was actually taking place, Zaluzhnyi said Ukrainian authorities could neither confirm nor deny it. But defending occupied territory on the west bank of Kherson had become increasingly difficult for the Russians as Ukrainian forces disabled bridges across the Dnipro and attacked Russian supply lines. While Russia's top military leaders attempted to put the best possible face on the withdrawal, it is undoubtedly a major and humiliating setback for the Kremlin. ""I understand that this is a very difficult decision, but at the same time we will preserve the most important thing -- the lives of our servicemen and the overall combat capability of the grouping of troops, which is futile to keep on the right (west) bank in a limited area,"" said General Sergey Surovikin, the recently appointed commander of the war effort. If and when Russian troops do withdraw to the east bank, their supply lines will become easier to manage and they will regain defense in depth. Any attempt by Ukrainian forces to cross the Dnipro could be costly to the point of prohibitive. Russia would still retain control of 60% of the Kherson region, including the coastline along the Sea of Azov. So long as Moscow's troops control and fortify the Dnipro's east bank, Ukrainian forces will struggle to damage or disrupt the canal that carries fresh water to Crimea. On Thursday night, several social media accounts in Kherson spoke of explosions along the river on Thursday night. Local groups reported on Telegram channels that two bridges near Kherson city had been shelled from the east bank, where the Russians have fortified positions. CNN is unable to verify the reports and no geolocatable images have emerged. Telegram channels also reported gunfire on the outskirts of the city, and upriver, local social media networks reported explosions in Kakhovka and the sound of motorboats crossing the river. There were also reports — again unofficial — of explosions on or near bridges at Zahorianivka and Muzykivka and near the Kakhovka hydro-electric power plant, where there is a large dam. Neither the Ukrainian government nor Russian appointees in Kherson have commented on the explosions. As Russian forces pulled back in Kherson, Ukrainian authorities in neighboring Mykolaiv were hoping for some respite from the persistent missile attacks that have hit the city over the past few months. Vitalii Kim, head of Mykolaiv regional administration, said on his Telegram channel: ""Lots of good news for today. We are preparing to reconnect electricity, heat, humanitarian aid kits, medicines, etc."" The last few settlements in the Mykolaiv region occupied by the Russians have now been liberated, but Kim said: ""We continue to remain silent, because it is all the military's business.""",14,2.2959548871225133,4.773524759622305,-2.4775698724997914,8

The revelation will raise concerns in Washington and European capitals that allies supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion could face greater cyber threats from Moscow. Poland is a NATO member and a key conduit for supplying military aid to Ukraine. The hacks ""did cause damage"" at the transportation and logistics companies in Poland and Ukraine, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN. The extent of the damage was unclear. CNN has requested further details from Microsoft. Microsoft attributed the hacks to a group that the Justice Department alleges works on behalf of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency and which caused power blackouts in parts of Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. One of Ukraine's main cybersecurity agencies, the State Special Communications Service, declined to comment. It's a rare public example of an alleged Russian hack related to the war causing damage in a NATO member country. During Russia's February invasion, another suspected Russian hack wiped data at two Ukrainian government contractors with a presence in Latvia and Lithuania, but that was widely seen among analysts as collateral damage rather than deliberate. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said a cyberattack could trigger NATO's collective defense clause, requiring all members to defend an attack on another member. But that has never happened, and it is unclear what exactly NATO's threshold in cyberspace is for a response. ""We do not state openly what level or damage the cyber-attack would have to cause,"" NATO spokesperson Matthias Eichenlaub said in an email. ""Any invocation of article 5 is always a political decision taken by all Allies by consensus."" The GRU-linked ransomware attacks signal ""increased risk to organizations directly supplying or transporting humanitarian or military assistance to Ukraine,"" researchers from Microsoft, which has worked directly with the Ukrainian government to respond to the hacks, said in a statement. The Russian embassy in Washington, DC, did not respond to a request for comment on Microsoft's statement. Moscow routinely denies conducting cyberattacks. Russian hacking groups have carried out a slew of cyberattacks during the war on Ukrainian government and corporate networks in activity that sometimes overlaps with Russia military strikes. But the kind of high-impact hack that takes out power or other critical networks has largely been missing. Russian hacking has played a peripheral, rather than central, role in the Kremlin's efforts to dismantle Ukrainian critical infrastructure, US and Ukrainian officials previously told CNN.",3,8.686320138108403,4.846335012529891,3.8399851255785125,23

The Russian-appointed deputy head of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine, Kirill Stremousov, died in a road accident, the press secretary of the head of the region said, according to Russian news agency TASS. Also on Wednesday, Russia ordered a retreat from the west bank of the Dnipro River across the Kherson region, a dramatic setback for Moscow in the face of recent Ukrainian advances. Stremousov was killed in an accident on the highway between Kherson and Armyansk in Crimea, the Russian state media company Vesti (VGTRK) reported, citing the region's health minister. Stremousov was 45 years old, according to Vesti. His death was also announced by the Russian-appointed ""head"" of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, who wrote in a statement on Telegram: ""It is very hard for me to say that Kirill Stremousov died today. He died on the territory of the Kherson region, moving in a car that got into an accident."" Stremousov, a Ukrainian who was quick to side with the Russian occupation when Kherson fell early in the invasion, had become one of the most vocal and outspoken of Russian appointees. As deputy head of the Kherson region military administration, Stremousov was prominent in organizing and supporting the referendum on Kherson's illegal annexation by Russia and more recently had been the driving force in the evacuation of civilians from the west bank in Kherson, as Ukrainian forces pushed toward the Dnipro. On Tuesday, Stremousov said: ""Most residents who decided to stay in Kherson are only now beginning to realize the gravity of the situation and my warnings."" Stremousov frequently took to Telegram to describe Ukrainian officials and forces as ""Nazis"" and ""fascists."" But he was also critical of missteps by the Russian military. He had blamed the military setbacks in Kherson on ""incompetent commanders"" who had not been held accountable for their mistakes. Later on Wednesday, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu ordered the withdrawal of Russian forces from the west bank of the Dnipro, Russian state media reported. This would be the most significant military development in the war since Ukrainian forces swept through the northern Kharkiv region in September. Shoigu's order came as Ukrainian forces make advances toward the city of Kherson from two directions. Russian forces have also destroyed bridges across occupied parts of the Kherson region west of the Dnipro, a local Ukrainian official and Russian military analysts on Telegram reported earlier. Skepticism and murky circumstances A Ukrainian official expressed skepticism about the reports of Stremousov's death. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, first deputy head of the Ukrainian Kherson regional council, said on Telegram: ""Regarding the information spread by the occupiers and Russian sources regarding the death of collaborator Kirill Stremousov in an accident, so far we can neither confirm nor deny the information. It may be true, or it may be staged."" Stremousov had previously had a checkered career as a local politician in Kherson, and was involved in several fracas. He also dabbled in paganism and a peculiar form of yoga. Video from 2017 showed him swinging his baby daughter around his head by her feet. Stremousov is not the first Russian-backed leader to die in murky circumstances. Alexander Zakharchenko, the leader of Russian-backed separatists, was killed in the bombing of a café in 2018. Several separatist commanders were also killed in a string of assassinations before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that went unsolved. Russian and separatist leaders blamed Ukraine for the killings. Ukrainian officials in turn claimed the Moscow was eliminating troublesome local leaders. Several prominent separatists had reputed links to organized crime and some observers suggested their deaths may have also been score-settling by criminal groups.",14,4.377687618278774,1.7932254953112405,2.5844621229675333,8

In the face of Ukrainian advances in the region, Russian troops across the Kherson region will withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro River, an area that includes Kherson city, Russian state media reported Wednesday. The order came at a meeting in Moscow between Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, as Ukrainian forces approach the city from two directions. The Russian withdrawal would represent the most significant military moment in the war since Ukrainian forces swept through the northern Kharkiv region in September. Ukrainian officials have however remained skeptical that Russian forces had left the west bank altogether. ""Actions speak louder than words. We see no signs that Russia is leaving Kherson without a fight,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser in the Office of the President, tweeted. Ukraine ""is liberating territories based on intelligence data, not staged TV statements,"" Podolyak added. Defending occupied territory on the west bank of Kherson had become increasingly difficult for the Russians as Ukrainian forces disabled bridges across the Dnipro and attacked Russian supply lines. Kherson was one of four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Russia in September. Once the withdrawal is complete, several thousand square kilometers of that annexed territory will have been surrendered. The withdrawal ""demonstrates the courage, the determination, the commitment of Ukrainian armed forces and also the importance of the continued support"" of the West, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Surovikin said that ""Kherson [city] and adjacent settlements in the current conditions cannot be fully supplied and function."" Surovikin claimed that Ukrainian forces ""are attacking schools, hospitals and civilians in Kherson, who are being evacuated to the other side of the Dnipro river."" Surovikin, who had warned that difficult choices would be required when he was appointed overall commander of the operation, said: ""The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation successfully resisted the attempts of the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the direction of Kherson."" He claimed that ""from August to October, the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost more than 9,500 people in Kherson,"" a number he said was seven to eight times more than Russian losses. It is impossible to verify Surovikin's claim. Meanwhile, Russian reporters in Kherson's north have described withdrawals from some areas. A prominent Russian Telegram channel, with more than one million subscribers, reported ""there was a withdrawal to back up positions,"" near the town of Snihurivka, on the west bank, which is in neighboring Mykolaiv region. ""A bridge was also blown up by our forces in this area today,"" the channel, RVVoenkor, reported. It added: ""Ukrainian sources published a photo with the raising of their flag at the Snihurivka railway station. The settlement is under their control."" CNN has geolocated the photograph of the flag on a tower in Snihurivka. The channel also said that the Ukrainians had entered a nearby village (Kalynivske) and that ""the front line is steadily moving towards Kherson."" Another Russian military reporter, Alexander Kots, said on Telegram that after ""receiving several urgent recommendations to cross to the east bank"" from Kherson city, he decided to take two Russian flags on the departing ferry ""so that those who would mock our state symbols would not get them."" Kots added: ""One was taken from the flagpole at the City Council.....I'll keep the state flag until we come back. So I can hang it up again.""",14,2.579898037229949,3.4333115447502203,-0.8534135075202713,8

In the occupied city of Kherson, Russian troops are now largely wearing civilian clothing and living in civilian housing as they ""strengthen positions inside for conducting street battles,"" according to the Ukrainian military and a resident of the city with whom CNN exchanged messages. Ukrainian forces have taken back a significant swathe of territory in Kherson that Russian troops had seized shortly after the invasion began in late February. Kyiv strung together a series of surprising victories in early October in the region, but progress has slowed as Ukrainian forces edge closer to the regional capital, the city of Kherson. It appears as though an intense battle for the city may be looming. ""Amid the counteroffensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the occupiers have significantly intensified filtration measures,"" the National Resistance Center, a creation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said on Monday. ""Raids among the local population have intensified in the temporarily occupied part of Kherson region. The occupiers are actively looking for the underground movement."" The National Resistance Center said that it was aware of dozens of detentions in recent days. It called on civilians to leave the occupied territories ""if possible"" while the Ukrainian military pushed its counter-offensive. A top Russian-backed official in the city, Kirill Stremousov, said Monday was the last day that Russia offered an ""organized evacuation"" for civilians from the western bank of the Dnipro River in the occupied portion of the Kherson region. ""Most residents who decided to stay in Kherson are only now beginning to realize the gravity of the situation and my warnings,"" Stremousov, the Russia-appointed deputy head of the Kherson region military administration, said on Telegram. Anyone who leaves the Kherson region will be given ""a one-time payment of 100,000 rubles"" -- about $1,600 -- ""and a housing certificate,"" Stremousov said. Kherson is one of four regions Russia has said it will annex from Ukraine in violation of international law. Moscow's immediate plans for the city of Kherson, however, are unclear. Stremousov said Friday that it was ""under the defense of Russian servicemen."" Ukrainian officials said that Russian forces continue to deepen their defensive lines in Kherson as Ukrainian units push forward along the west bank of the Dnipro River. However, Stremousov said Thursday that Russian troops would ""most likely"" fall back from positions in the southern city, but Ukrainian officials suggested the statement could be a trap -- a sentiment echoed by military spokeswoman Natalia Humeniuk on Saturday. ""Russian troops are trying hard to convince everyone they are retreating but at the same time we are seeing objective evidence that they are staying,"" Humeniuk said in an interview with Ukrainian media. Kherson residents have reported seeing an increased military presence in the streets. A resident of the occupied city of Kherson told CNN through a third party on Sunday that Russian soldiers in occupied villages are behaving more aggressively towards civilians. ""On the west bank, near Snihurivka, there are cases of occupiers moving into locals' houses when people move to the city,"" the resident said. ""Many soldiers came to the villages, they settle in empty houses. But there are cases when they kick people out of their homes."" CNN is not identifying the Kherson resident for their safety. The city of Kherson itself has been ""relatively quiet,"" she said. ""From time to time you can hear automatic gunfire at night,"" the resident said. ""There is a curfew in the city, and no one goes out at night. The occupiers have created some kind of territorial defense in the city, which deals with security issues."" Checkpoints within the city itself have been removed, she said. ""There are only checkpoints at the entrance to the city. At the checkpoint they check documents and look what is in the car. If it is public transport, then the soldier enters the minibus. It may vary, it all depends on the mood of the occupiers. They can start checking phones and force men to undress to check for tattoos."" The resident said that most soldiers appear to be over the age of 30, but that they had begun to see more young men, around ages 18 to 20. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has meanwhile claimed to have disrupted a ""sabotage and reconnaissance group"" in the region, and detained nine Ukrainian citizens. The FSB said that it had ""revealed and prevented the activities of an SBU [Security Service of Ukraine] sabotage and reconnaissance group in Kherson region, whose tasks included committing terrorist acts against high-ranking members of the military and civil administration of Kherson region."" The FSB claimed to have discovered explosives, detonators and small arms. The Ukrainian government has not commented on the claimed arrests. Power outage continues Water and electricity in Kherson city were temporarily cut off Sunday after damage to infrastructure there. Russian authorities said a trio of ""reinforced concrete columns of high-voltage power lines"" were damaged in an attack by Ukrainian forces, while Kyiv blamed the Kremlin-backed forces occupying the city. CNN cannot independently confirm or verify details of the claimed attack or who was behind it. The Kremlin has, in recent weeks, stepped up attacks on civilian energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials alleged that Moscow is attempting to shut off power throughout the country so Ukrainians, civilian and military alike, freeze when winter comes. As of Monday morning in Kherson, Russian authorities were still trying to restore power. Stremousov, the Russia-appointed deputy head of Kherson region military administration, said he believed electricity and communications would return ""in the near future."" He added that there is no problem with food supply and, though some pharmacies are shut, it is ""not impossible to get social benefits."" Stremousov said that authorities continued to offer ""evacuation"" to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, including now to bed-ridden civilians or those with reduced mobility. Evacuation offers like this have sparked concerns that Ukrainian citizens may be forced to go to Russian territory against their will. Reports emerged early in the war of tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians being forcibly sent to so-called ""filtration centers"" before being moved to Russia. Moscow denounced the claims as lies, alleging that Ukraine has hindered its efforts to ""evacuate"" people to Russia. Serhii Khlan, a member of the Kherson Regional Council, said Russian forces have continued to force civilians from their homes on the east bank of the Dnipro. The Kherson city resident who spoke to CNN viewed the idea of getting on an ""evacuation bus"" to Crimea as a ""one-way ticket.""",14,4.075740295342827,3.4453726987629145,0.6303675965799127,8
2022-11-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/politics/russia-cyber-attacks-missiles-ukraine-blackouts/index.html,Russian missile strikes overshadow cyberattacks as Ukraine reels from blackouts,"Russia has pummeled Ukrainian cities with missile and drone strikes for much of the past month, targeting civilians and large swaths of the country's critical infrastructure. By Monday, 40% of Kyiv residents were left without water, and widespread power outages were reported across the country. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of 'energy terrorism' and said that about 4.5 million Ukrainian consumers were temporarily disconnected from the power supply. The destruction exemplifies how indiscriminate bombing remains the Kremlin's preferred tactic eight months into its war on Ukraine. Moscow's vaunted hacking capabilities, meanwhile, continue to play a peripheral, rather than central, role in the Kremlin's efforts to dismantle Ukrainian critical infrastructure. ""Why burn your cyber capabilities, if you're able to accomplish the same goals through kinetic attacks?"" a senior US official told CNN. But experts who spoke to CNN suggest there is likely more to the question of why Russia's cyberattacks haven't made a more visible impact on the battlefield. Effectively combining cyber and kinetic operations ""requires a high degree of integrated planning and execution,"" argued a US military official who focuses on cyber defense. ""The Russians can't even pull that sh*t off between their aviation, artillery and ground assault forces."" A lack of verifiable information about successful cyberattacks during the war complicates the picture. A Western official focused on cybersecurity said the Ukrainians are likely not publicly revealing the full extent of the impacts of Russian hacks on their infrastructure and their correlation with Russian missile strikes. That could deprive Russia of insights into the efficacy of their cyber operations, and in turn affect Russia's war planning, the official said. To be sure, a flurry of suspected Russian cyberattacks have hit various Ukrainian industries, and some of the hacks have correlated with Russia's military objectives. But the kind of high-impact hack that takes out power or transportation networks have largely been missing. Nowhere was that more evident than the recent weeks of Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. That's a stark contrast to 2015 and 2016 when, following Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, it was Russian military hackers, not bombs, that plunged more than a quarter million Ukrainians into darkness. ""All the Ukrainian citizens are now living in these circumstances,"" said Victor Zhora, a senior Ukrainian government cybersecurity official, referring to the blackouts and water shortages. ""Imagine your ordinary day in the face of constant disruptions of power or water supply, mobile communication or everything combined."" 'Big, showy public response' Cyber operations aimed at industrial plants can take many months to plan, and after the explosion in early October of a bridge linking Crimea to Russia, Putin was ""trying to go for a big, showy public response to the attack on the bridge,"" the senior US official said. But officials tell CNN that Ukraine also deserves credit for its improved cyber defenses. In April, Kyiv claimed to thwart a hacking attempt on power substations by the same group of Russian military hackers that caused blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. The war's human toll has overshadowed those triumphs. Ukrainian cybersecurity officials have for months had to avoid shelling while also doing their jobs: protecting government networks from Russia's spy agencies and criminal hackers. Four officials from one of Ukraine's main cyber and communications agencies — the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) — were killed October 10 in missile attacks, the agency said in a press release. The four officials did not have cybersecurity responsibilities, but their loss has weighed heavily on cybersecurity officials at the agency during another grim month of war. Better prepared after years of attacks Hackers linked with Russian spy and military agencies have for years targeted Ukrainian government agencies and critical infrastructure with an array of hacking tools. At least six different Kremlin-linked hacking groups conducted nearly 240 cyber operations against Ukrainian targets in the buildup to and weeks after Russia's February invasion, Microsoft said in April. That includes a hack, which the White House blamed on the Kremlin, that disrupted satellite internet communications in Ukraine on the eve of Russia's invasion. ""I don't think Russia would measure the success in cyberspace by a single attack,"" the Western official said, rather ""by their cumulative effect"" of trying to wear the Ukrainians down. But there are now open questions among some private analysts and US and Ukrainian officials about the extent to which Russian government hackers have already used up, or ""burned,"" some of their more sensitive access to Ukrainian critical infrastructure in previous attacks. Hackers often lose access to their original way into a computer network once they are discovered. In 2017, as Russia's hybrid war in eastern Ukraine continued, Russia's military intelligence agency unleashed destructive malware known as NotPetya that wiped computer systems at companies across Ukraine before spreading around the world, according to the Justice Department and private investigators. The incident cost the global economy billions of dollars by disrupting shipping giant Maersk and other multinational firms. That operation involved identifying widely used Ukrainian software, infiltrating it and injecting malicious code to weaponize it, said Matt Olney, director of threat intelligence and interdiction at Talos, Cisco's threat intelligence unit. ""All of that was just as astonishingly effective as the end product was,"" said Olney, who has had a team in Ukraine responding to cyber incidents for years. ""And that takes time and it takes opportunities that sometimes you can't just conjure."" ""I'm pretty certain [the Russians] wish that they had what they burned during NotPetya,"" Olney told CNN. Zhora, the Ukrainian official who is a deputy chairman at SSSCIP, called for Western governments to tighten sanctions on Russia's access to software tools that could feed its hacking arsenal. ""We should not discard the probability that [Russian government hacking] groups are working right now on some high-complexity attacks that we will observe later on,"" Zhora told CNN. ""It is highly unlikely that all Russian military hackers and government-controlled groups are on vacation or out of business."" Tanel Sepp, Estonia's ambassador-at-large for cyber affairs, told CNN that it's possible the Russians could turn to a ""new wave"" of stepped up cyberattacks as their battlefield struggles continue. ""Our main goal is to isolate Russia on the international stage"" as much as possible, Sepp said, adding that the former Soviet state has not communicated with Russia on cybersecurity issues in months.",3,4.799742139545572,3.596045120987296,1.2036970185582758,23
2022-11-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/europe/russia-ukraine-law-mobilize-serious-crime-offenders-intl/index.html,Putin signs law to mobilize Russian citizens convicted of serious crimes,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law to conscript citizens with unexpunged or outstanding convictions for murder, robbery, larceny, drug trafficking and other serious crimes under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation to be called up for military service to mobilize. This makes it possible to mobilize hundreds of thousands of people who have been sentenced to probation or have recently been released from colonies who were previously forbidden to serve. The only group of criminals exempted from the decree are those who committed sex crimes against minors, treason, spying or terrorism. Also excluded are those convicted of the attempted assassination of a government official, hijacking an aircraft, extremist activity and illegal handling of nuclear materials and radioactive substances. President Vladmir Putin said Friday that the Kremlin had already mobilized an additional 18,000 soldiers above its goal of 300,000 to fight in its war in Ukraine from the general male population of Russia. Earlier this week, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that all partial mobilization activities, including summons deliveries, had been suspended after officials said the draft's target of recruiting 300,000 personnel had been met. However, Putin's partial mobilization order will only end when the Russian President signs in an official decree. Until then, he reserves the right to recruit more people into military conscription in the future. The head of Russia's notorious Wagner forces, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has apparently summoned prisoners from Russian jails to join the mercenary group in fighting the Kremlin's war in Ukraine. The amendments signed by Putin are unrelated to these alleged recruitments. Instead, the law applies to prisoners who were conditionally convicted or released from colonies. These people usually must remain under the supervision of the authorities for eight to ten years until the conviction is canceled. They are not allowed to leave their place of residence and must comply with various restrictions.",13,4.864000877913452,4.510366614755317,0.35363426315813484,24
2022-11-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/europe/ukraine-energy-terrorism-zelensky-russia-intl/index.html,Zelensky accuses Moscow of energy 'terrorism' as Russian strikes knock out power for millions,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of ""energy terrorism"" after Moscow's repeated attacks on key infrastructure knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people. About 450,000 households across Kyiv were without electricity on Friday as power outages across the country continue, according to the city's mayor Vitalii Klitschko. ""It is one and a half times more than the recent days,"" Klitschko said on Telegram. Across the country, about 4.5 million consumers were temporarily disconnected from the power supply on Thursday under emergency and stabilization schedules, according to Zelensky. The outages follow dire warnings about a cold and difficult winter ahead for those staying in the country, after weeks of Russian airstrikes and rocket attacks on Ukraine's power grid . Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted to alleviate such fears and said Friday that Moscow would ""continue to treat the Ukrainian people with respect and warmth. This is how it was and is, despite today's tragic confrontation."" ""A clash with neo-Nazis was inevitable, brought to the point where the situation has become deadly for Russia,"" Putin added. But this week alone, attacks on critical infrastructure in the regions of Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia have left millions without electricity and water intermittently. ""The very fact that Russia has resorted to terror against the energy sector indicates the weakness of the enemy. They cannot defeat Ukraine on the battlefield and therefore they are trying to break our people in this way,"" Zelensky said during his nightly address. Russia's recurrent aerial attacks have dragged cities in central and western Ukraine back to the forefront of the war, leaving residents in the capital struggling to keep businesses running, along with water and other resources. Ukraine's national power supply company, Ukrenergo, said earlier this week that several regions will face extended power cuts as they try to repair damage caused by recent strikes. The G7 group of wealthy nations will coordinate their support for Ukraine as winter approaches the conflict-torn country, German Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said Thursday, ahead of a meeting of the group's foreign ministers in the western German city of Muenster. ''We will not allow the brutality of the war to lead to the death of lots of elderly people, children, teenagers and families to die from hunger or cold over the upcoming winter months due to the brutal tactics of the Russian president,"" Baerbock told reporters. The Ukrainian military says that Russian forces have meanwhile stepped up air attacks near the eastern frontlines, using multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), especially in Donetsk region. The military's General Staff said 80 such attacks were recorded Wednesday, while on Thursday ""the enemy carried out four missile and 28 air strikes, and fired more than 45 times from MLRS."" Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the overall commander of Ukraine's armed forces, said that during a conversation on Thursday with General Christopher Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, he noted that ""the enemy tripled the intensity of hostilities on certain areas of the front -- up to 80 attacks daily."" Russian forces and ""collaborators"" also began a census in the city of Enerhodar, which is next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to Ukrainian officials. Dmytro Orlov, the displaced mayor of Enerhodar, said ""they are doing it in their typical manner, by force since one cannot decline participation in the 'census'."" ""For the second day now, the ruscists along with collaborators with the so-called police are doing the door-to-door tours and intercepting people in the courtyards. This was reported by local residents who had to participate in the 'census',"" Orlov claimed. ""In many cases the census ends up with a rummage and browsing through the apps of mobile phones. Please be aware!"" he said. The pre-war population of the city was about 50,000. It has been under Russian occupation since early March. The state company that runs the nuclear plant, Energoatom, reported Thursday that further Russian shelling some 50 kilometers from the plant had disabled two high voltage transmission lines, and that the power plant had gone to ""full black-out mode. All 20 diesel generators started operating."" The plant is run by Ukrainian technicians but is under the control of the Russian state operator Rusatom. Further south, social media video and local Telegram channels indicated explosions near an airfield just north of Kherson city, in an area occupied by Russian forces. The video showed a large plume of black smoke rising from the area of Chornobaivka. Ukrainian troops and Russian-appointed officials in the area have not officially commented on the footage. On the east bank of the Dnipro river further north, unofficial Telegram channels say that Russian forces are forcing local people to leave the village of Velyka Lepetykha. Russian-backed authorities have already announced an evacuation of civilians from a 15-kilometer zone along the river as they create new defenses in the area. Those same channels say a mandatory evacuation is also underway in the village of Hornostayivka further downstream, while new explosions have been heard in the town of Nova Kakhovka, also on the east bank and close to a dam and hydro electric plant on the river. Humanitarian bodies have said such a strategy could constitute human rights violations.",17,4.4185941466946925,5.878022590055036,-1.459428443360343,10
2022-11-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/yevgeny-prigozhin-ukraine-putin-kremlin-war-ukraine/index.html,Russian mercenaries jockey for influence amid military struggles in Ukraine,"One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies is using dissent around the war in Ukraine to jockey for increased influence inside the Kremlin, US and European officials said, offering a rare glimpse at the brewing tension among Putin allies and how Russia's disastrous war in Ukraine is affecting the internal dynamics of the Kremlin. ""It's a real-life 'House of Cards,' but in the Kremlin,"" said one source familiar with US intelligence. ""All stabbing each other in the back."" Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner Group paramilitary organization, has confronted Putin directly about his belief that the war in Ukraine is being mismanaged by top generals who are currently in charge, US officials tell CNN. US intelligence officials deemed the Prigozhin meeting as significant enough to include in one of President Joe Biden's daily briefing last month, sources said. Prigozhin's complaints come as at least one other Kremlin official has raised similar concerns to Putin about the Russian military's poor handling of the war in Ukraine, two sources familiar with the intelligence tell CNN. While it's unclear how Putin reacted to the confrontation, US intelligence officials believe it is further evidence that Prigozhin, who is not part of the Russian government, is trying to assert his influence at a time when the US is closely watching the power structures inside the Kremlin. The Kremlin has denied that officials have criticized the management of the war. ""This information is fundamentally incorrect,"" Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov told CNN. ""President Putin holds meetings about the special military operation on a regular basis and all participants express different point of view in working mode."" The Washington Post first reported the meeting between Prigozhin and Putin. 'Opportunity to move up in station' Prigozhin in particular has used the chaos surrounding the conflict to try to bolster his own power at the expense of the Russian defense establishment, US and Western intelligence officials said. His forces have played an increasingly prominent role on the battlefield in Ukraine, one of a number of unofficial fighting forces that Moscow has turned to resolve manpower shortages on the frontlines — forces that are also jostling with one another for influence. The US believes Prigozhin's complaints to Putin have centered around the Russian Defense Ministry, and his belief that Russia's generals are bungling the operation and that more aggressive tactics should be used, the sources said. Prigozhin has issued stinging public criticisms of the Ministry of Defense on Telegram that echo his private messages to Putin, criticizing the generals in charge of the war and backing a more aggressive approach. And he has amassed a digital following on Telegram that the Washington think tank Institute for the Study of War has argued is ""increasingly challenging"" Putin's ""monopolization of the state information space"" — with some influential Russia military bloggers even suggesting that he replace Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Prigozhin ""sees an opportunity to move up in station,"" said Michael Kofman, an analyst specializing in the Russian military with the Center for Naval Analyses, and is ""seeking to embarrass Shoigu in the hopes of advancing himself."" US intelligence officials are keenly interested in determining how receptive the Russian leader has been to these criticisms of long-time insiders who previously appeared extremely secure in their positions, according to sources familiar with the matter — in part because it may give them a window into whether Putin is feeling pressured to take more drastic measures in Ukraine to regain momentum. US and European intelligence officials have long watched Shoigu, speculating that the disastrous unfolding of Putin's war might put him on thin ice in the Kremlin. But intelligence officials emphasize that accurately interpreting and predicting the power machinations inside Putin's Kremlin remains more of a murky art than a hard science. ""It is Russia — there are never ending court plots,"" said one US military official. Acute manpower shortages As Russia has contended with ongoing and acute manpower shortages on the front, Moscow has been forced to turn to a hodgepodge of fighting forces outside of the Russian military, including not only Wagner, but Chechen fighters and territorial militias from two separatist Ukrainian provinces. There has been a tremendous amount of infighting between those groups, sources said, making it almost impossible for Moscow to ""control all these elements in a coherent way,"" according to one source familiar with Western intelligence. That dynamic has contributed to a series of high-stakes power struggles in Moscow already underway as top Russian security officials have sought to deflect blame around -- or capitalize on -- the disaster unfolding in Ukraine. Wagner has emerged as among the more significant assault forces available to Russia, sources said, with their fighters often treated as disposable, according to Kofman. Like the Russian military, Prigozhin wants to preserve his best forces and as a result is recruiting fighters from Russian prisons as ""cannon fodder,"" according to one European intelligence official. Prigozhin has sought to exploit Moscow's reliance on his fighters to amass more power in Moscow — although to what end remains unclear, sources said. He has been increasingly willing to contradict Shoigu in recent weeks, according to the European intelligence official, but it remains an open question whether he wants his organization to be formally integrated into the Russian army. Still, Prigozhin's forces have failed to make significant advances in the Bakhmut area in Eastern Ukraine, where Wagner Group detachments have been unsuccessfully fighting since early summer to take the city. And there are other senior Kremlin officials and many Russian oligarchs who believe the war should be ended ""because Putin's ambitions are considered unrealistic,"" a senior Western intelligence official told CNN. It is unclear, though, whether they have voiced their opposition to the war to Putin directly. ""The Kremlin is walking on a tightrope,"" the official said. ""Mobilization is widely unpopular in Russia and all talk about ongoing and additional mobilization is prohibited in the controlled information space. Several senior officials would like the war to end because Putin's ambitions are considered unrealistic. Same with many oligarchs."" ""At the same time, you have people like Prigozhin, [Chechen leader Ramzan] Kadyrov and certain influential military bloggers who want Moscow to go 'all in.'""",14,5.590280451772078,3.700186914137288,1.8900935376347903,16
2022-11-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/europe/russia-helicopter-sabotage-video-intl/index.html,Sabotage of military helicopters deep inside Russia purportedly shown on video,"Video has emerged purporting to show a man preparing and planting explosives on a Russian military helicopter at an airbase deep inside Russia. Subsequent satellite imagery shows several damaged helicopters at the base in Pskov region in northern Russia. The base is about 35 kilometers from the border with Latvia, but nearly 1,000 kilometers from Ukraine. The sabotage of the helicopters is the furthest from Ukrainian territory that an attack has been confirmed against a Russian military target since the conflict began. The video shows an unidentified man placing something inside a helicopter. At one point he puts something to his ear, possibly a timer. At another moment, a Ka-52 attack helicopter is clearly visible. The video is shot in daylight but the explosions did not occur until after nightfall, according to unofficial Russian media. CNN has geolocated the video to the Veretye base at Beredniki. Ukraine's Defense Intelligence said Tuesday that a ""powerful explosion occurred at the air base of the Russian Armed Forces ""Veretier"" on the night of October 31."" While not claiming a Ukrainian sabotage unit carried out the attack, it said that ""as a result of mining, two Russian attack (KA-52) helicopters and one MI-28N were completely destroyed. Two more were significantly damaged."" A satellite image published Tuesday showed several damaged helicopters at the base, and one unofficial Russian media outlet reported explosions there. The Telegram channel Baza said: ""At around 10 pm [on October 31], the military personnel of the unit heard several explosions, and then saw the scattered wreckage of two helicopters. The explosion was so strong that the fragments of the fuselage scattered 200 meters around. The reason for the Ka-52 explosion is unknown."" Symbolism of the sabotage Such an audacious attack, so far from home soil, would be a first for Ukraine's special forces. While there is no confirmation they carried out the sabotage attack, the speed with which Ukrainian Defense Intelligence reported the details of the incident is at least intriguing. The symbolism of the sabotage is perhaps more important than its military consequences. Russia has hundreds of combat helicopters, and those damaged were nowhere near the theater. Ukrainian officials typically refuse to go on the record about any attacks in Russia itself, or even in annexed Crimea, but there have been several attacks much closer to Ukrainian territory since the Russian invasion began. Railway lines have been damaged in Belgorod, as have ammunition depots. The Millerovo airbase in Rostov region was hit -- apparently by Tochka missiles -- right at the start of the conflict, and several aircraft were damaged. And it's still unknown whether a devastating attack on a Russian air force base in Crimea in August was carried out by special forces on the ground or missiles. The exact cause of last month's attack on the Kerch Bridge is also unknown. And it seems the Ukrainians are quite happy not to acknowledge such attacks.",17,7.013843023705258,6.910255052492202,0.10358797121305585,14
2022-11-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/north-korea-russia-ammunition/index.html,First on CNN: US accuses North Korea of trying to hide shipments of ammunition to Russia,"The US is accusing North Korea of secretly supplying Russia with artillery shells for the Ukraine war by concealing where they are being transported to, according to newly declassified intelligence. US officials believe that the surreptitious North Korean shipments -- along with drones and other weaponry that Russia has acquired from Iran -- are further evidence that even Moscow's conventional artillery arsenals have dwindled during eight months of combat. North Korea is trying to hide the shipments by making it appear as if the ammunition is being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa, the intelligence says. The recent intelligence comes about two months after the US intelligence community said that it believed Russia was in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for use on the battlefield, CNN and other outlets reported at the time. ""In September, the (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) publicly denied that it intended to provide ammunition to Russia,"" the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said in a statement to CNN. ""However, our information indicates that the DPRK is covertly supplying Russia's war in Ukraine with a significant number of artillery shells, while obfuscating the real destination of the arms shipments by trying to make it appear as though they are being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa."" Officials did not provide evidence to support the new allegations. The declassified intelligence also did not provide details about how many weapons are part of the shipments, or how they would be paid for. ""We will continue to monitor whether these shipments are received,"" Kirby said, noting that Russia has continued to look to actors like North Korea and Iran to sustain its aggressive war in Ukraine ""amid supply shortages and the efficacy of international sanctions."" Ongoing effort to resupply Russian artillery American officials, however, have publicly touted the alleged deal as evidence that Russia is running out of weapons to continue the war. As recently as two weeks ago, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines argued that ""export controls are forcing Russia to turn to countries like Iran and North Korea for supplies, including UAVs, artillery shells and rockets."" Kirby said on Wednesday that the support from Iran and North Korea is ""not going to change the course of the war,"" with the US remaining committed to providing Ukraine with continued security assistance. But the shipments may now help Russia to bolster an important part of its war effort: a grinding artillery fight on the front lines. ""It could be significant development because one of the challenges for Russia has been sustaining artillery fire,"" said Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses, who emphasized he had no knowledge of the underlying intelligence. ""The Russian army has likely gone through millions of shells at this point."" Russia has been ""offsetting a deficit of manpower with much higher output of fires,"" Kofman said, a strategy that he said has ""likely been very costly on ammunition supplies"" and has left Russia, like Ukraine, scouring the globe for countries with Soviet-caliber artillery supplies that are compatible with its systems in order to sustain the war. In the weeks before the new intelligence was acquired, some military and intelligence officials were beginning to believe that North Korea was backing away from its agreement to provide weaponry to Russia, multiple officials explained to CNN. Some officials had begun to tout it as a victory for the Biden administration's strategy of selectively declassifying and publicizing some classified intelligence on Russia's pursuit of the war, believing that when the United States made the deal known, it shed an unwelcome light on a transaction that Pyongyang did not want disclosed. But now, US officials say that despite North Korea's denials, they believe the rogue regime has moved ahead with its support for Moscow as the war appears poised to grind into its second year. US officials have argued publicly that Russia has been forced to turn to North Korea and Iran for weaponry both because it has burned through its stockpiles in a conflict that has stretched many months longer than anticipated and because US and western export controls have made it more difficult for Russia to acquire the technological components it needs to rebuild its stocks on its own. US officials have said they will work to expose and counter the shipments to Russia from Iran and North Korea and target the networks that enable these shipments, but they have not explicitly laid out how they plan to do that. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Tuesday that the US military ""has engaged in interdictions"" of weapons shipments in the past, but would not say if interdictions are being considered as weapons flow into Russia. 'They're anxious for ammunition anywhere they can get it' The new intelligence that Russia is acquiring artillery shells from North Korea suggests that its shortages run deeper than just more sophisticated, precision-guided munitions, which US and western officials have long emphasized is a weak point in the Russian arsenal. It also extends to basic artillery. ""The Russians, by many accounts, are really wearing thin when it comes to some of those inputs that it needs to prosecute its war on Ukraine,"" Price said on Tuesday, pointing to export controls and sanctions that have starved Russia of the inputs to make certain weapons. The precise state of of Russia's conventional munitions stocks isn't publicly known, but Russia is ""burning through tens of thousands of rounds a day,"" said Adam Mount, the director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists, who specializes in North Korea. ""They're anxious for ammunition anywhere they can get it."" Over the summer, Russia was able to make some grinding progress in parts of Ukraine through a punishing artillery campaign. But since then, western-provided artillery has contributed to a successful counteroffensive push by Ukraine that has retaken large swaths of territory previously held by Russia. North Korea would likely be able to provide Russia with 122- or 152-millimeter artillery shells and either tube artillery or multiple-rocket-launcher artillery that would be compatible with Russia's systems, said Bruce Klingner, a former Korea analyst at the CIA who is now at the Heritage Foundation. But for now, it's unclear how impactful North Korea's artillery shells will be to Russia on the battlefield. In 2010, North Korea fired 170 122-millimeter shells at South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island. Fewer than half hit the island, and of those, about a quarter failed to detonate -- a high failure rate that ""suggests that some DPRK-manufactured artillery munitions, especially (multiple rocket launcher) rounds, suffer from either poor quality control during manufacture or that storage conditions and standards are poor,"" according to a 2016 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The last time that they made use of these systems showed that their systems were fairly inaccurate,"" Mount said. ""You'd expect these Soviet-era systems are aging so they will start to break down."" This has been updated with additional reporting.",14,5.280889977066626,6.315386383442107,-1.0344964063754807,12

Military units will only be accepting volunteers and contractors from now on, a statement from the ministry added. President Vladimir Putin announced the mobilization in late September after Russia suffered a series of major setbacks on the battlefields in Ukraine. Officials said the draft's target of recruiting 300,000 personnel had been met as of last week. While Putin has defended the draft, its chaotic execution led to angry demonstrations and prompted hundreds of thousands to flee Russia. Putin said Tuesday that the mobilization had been ""completed"" and that ""the line has been drawn,"" a suggestion that there would be no further drafts. He added that 41,000 of those recruited were currently in combat formations of the Russian military, meaning that ""almost 260,000 people are not participating in any hostilities but are being trained."" The roll out of the mobilization was beset by errors. Early on in the process, some residents in areas including Russia's Far East Sakha Republic were conscripted ""by mistake"" despite not being eligible for mobilization, such as fathers of underage children, according to a local leader there. Since it was announced, protests have erupted in ethnic minority regions, and some military enlistment offices have been set on fire. The original announcement also sparked rare anti-war demonstrations across Russia. The country was forced to heighten security measures at military registration and enlistment offices ""due to increasing attacks"" on those facilities, a senior Russian official said in a previous CNN report. Two gunmen said to be from former Soviet states opened fire on Russian military recruits on October 15 during a training session in the Belgorod region, killing 11 people, state news agency TASS reported, citing the Russian Defense Ministry as a source. Alexander Khinshtein, a deputy in the Russian parliament, said on Telegram that ""intruders"" have also been caught ""red-handed"" trying to launch an attack on military enlistment centers. A man opened fire at one such building late last month, seriously injuring a commander, state media reported. Countless Russians have fled the country as a result of the partial mobilization. More than 200,000 people traveled from Russia into Georgia, Kazakhstan and the European Union in just the first week, collective data from those regions showed. ""I was angry and afraid,"" Vadim, who left Russia for Kazakhstan with his grandmother after the announcement, told CNN this month. ""We don't want this war ... we can't change something in our country, though we have tried."" And the benefits of the mobilization have also been questionable, according to experts. It is unclear whether the influx of newly-trained recruits has had any impact in ground fighting in eastern and southern Ukraine, where Kyiv has seen gains in recent weeks.",14,4.775110040137152,7.014925204759761,-2.239815164622609,24
2022-10-31,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/europe/russian-missile-strikes-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Russian missiles bombard cities across Ukraine, hitting power and water infrastructure","Russia launched a barrage of missile strikes at Ukrainian cities on Monday as it ramped up its attacks on infrastructure facilities across the country. Explosions and air raid sirens were heard in Kyiv early on Monday and 80% of residents were left without water -- with many losing electricity, too -- following power outages caused by Russian strikes, the capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram. One of the strikes hit an energy facility that powered 350,000 apartments in the capital, Klitschko said, adding that emergency services were attempting to restore power and ""stabilize the situation as soon as possible."" Attacks on critical infrastructure in the central regions of Cherkasy and Kirovohrad, the eastern region of Kharkiv, and the southern region of Zaphorizhzhia were also reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that the onslaught was ""partly"" a response to an attack on Russia's fleet in the Crimean city of Sevastopol on Saturday, which he blamed on Kyiv. Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014 and has controlled the territory since then. Putin also warned that the strikes are ""not all we could do."" Shot down by Ukraine The Ukrainian military said it had eliminated about 90% of the Russian missiles used in the attacks. ""The enemy attacked military and civilian infrastructure facilities with 55 aircraft guided missiles, 45 of which were shot down by our defenders,"" the military's General Staff said. By Monday afternoon, power was still partially out for many -- though it had been restored to some. ""Power engineers plan to stabilize the situation with the electricity supply at about 9-10 pm."" Klitschko said on Telegram, adding: ""But even after the resumption of electricity supply, power cuts will still be applied. Because the situation is difficult."" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that diplomats ""are in constant contact with their partners"" to try to get assistance and equipment to repair the extensive damage. Kyiv is in touch with the European Union and NATO as well as several governments. It had already concluded agreements in 12 countries to obtain nearly 1,000 units of power equipment, including generators, according to Kuleba. ""We continue to work on increasing the number of partners and the volume of support,"" he added. Earlier, Klitschko urged residents of the capital to stock up on water from shops and pumping stations after an attack on a nearby power facility. ""Currently, due to damage to the energy facility near Kyiv, 80% of the capital's consumers remain without water supply,"" he said on Telegram. ""Just in case, we ask you to stock up on water from the nearest pumps and points of sale. Specialists are doing everything possible to return water to the apartments of Kyiv residents."" Speaking to CNN on the ground in Kyiv, 31-year-old Yana Lysenko said: ""Monday morning has started horribly as usual. I have a 4-year-old child, so of course I feel stressed. ""We don't have water right now, but we do have electricity. We hope that the services will restore everything very quickly. Our spirit is very high, and we are waiting for victory. Such terrorist actions targeting water and electricity supply, I believe, do not scare people anymore."" Viktor Halashan, aged 70, told CNN he is remaining positive despite having no water supply. ""Not having water is fine, we can handle this,"" he said, adding that he hopes Ukraine's ""troops will get us closer to victory soon."" Local office worker Oleksandr Nechepuriak told CNN he was collecting water for 15 people. ""It's important to get (the)office running,"" said Nechepuriak, who works in food production. ""We will handle this,"" he said, adding that there are ""no other options."" Homes in Kharkiv also without water Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, described the attacks as ""barbaric,"" saying on Facebook: ""Electric substations, hydropower and heat generation facilities were hit by rocket fire."" He added: ""As a result of this massive attack, there was a partial blackout and emergency power outage schedules were introduced for consumers in Kyiv, Cherkasy (and) Zaporizhzhia, and Cherkasy, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, (and) Poltava regions."" The water supply in Kharkiv -- Ukraine's second-largest city -- was also affected after an infrastructure facility was hit, while most subway train services were halted, mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram. ""The blow fell on a critical infrastructure facility, resulting in the subway and ground electric transport being de-energized,"" he said. ""At the moment, we have managed to launch the Kholodnohirsko-Zavodska (subway) line, and we have replaced trolleybuses and trams with buses."" Terekhov said engineers were ""doing everything possible to resume water supply to the homes of Kharkiv residents as soon as possible."" Two missiles hit Kharkiv on Monday morning, the mayor had previously said on Telegram. And in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, one missile hit an industrial enterprise, mayor Oleksandr Vilkul said on Telegram. ""During the morning missile attack, two missiles were shot down (thanks to the Air Defense Forces), and one cruise missile hit an industrial enterprise,"" he said. There were no casualties reported. Monday's strikes hit 10 regions and damaged 18 facilities, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Telegram. ""Their target was not military facilities, but civilian critical infrastructure,"" Shmyhal said. ""Missiles and drones hit 10 regions, where 18 facilities were damaged, most of them energy-related."" He said ""hundreds of settlements in seven regions"" had lost power and engineers were ""working at full capacity"" to repair the damage. Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched more than 50 cruise missiles into Ukraine on Monday, and said it had intercepted 44 of them. ""At 7:00 a.m. on October 31, the Russian occupiers launched several waves of missile attacks on critical infrastructure facilities in Ukraine,"" the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said. ""More than 50 X-101/X-555 cruise missiles were launched from the Tu-95/Tu-160 strategic aviation missile-carrying aircraft north of the Caspian Sea and the Volgodonsk region (Rostov region). 44 cruise missiles were destroyed"" by the Ukrainian military, the air force statement added. At least 10 Russian missiles were shot down over Kyiv early on Monday, regional police chief Andrii Nebytov said on Telegram. ""The police of the Kyiv region are now discovering debris from downed rockets of the occupiers in various areas of the region,"" he said. ""Air defense forces shot down at least 10 enemy missiles."" Oleksii Kuleba, head of Kyiv region military administration, said the strikes ""hit critical infrastructure targets"" and two people had been injured, one seriously. Monday's missiles were launched from Soviet-era Tupolev Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers that took off from Russia's Rostov region and over the Caspian Sea, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force Command said on television. Yurii Ihnat said there had been ""several waves of missile launches"" and repeated the claim that Ukraine had shot down ""a really high percentage."" Ihnat also appealed for more US and German air defenses in the wake of the attacks. ""We need air defense. Those systems that we have already mentioned, the (German-made) IRIS-T, we need more of them,"" he said. So far Germany has supplied Ukraine with one IRIS-T. ""This system works and it worked today, and worked with a 100% result,"" Ihnat said. ""And we want the Germans to increase production."" He also mentioned the US-made NASAMS system, which is due to be delivered, and older systems such as the US-made HAWK ground-to-air missile. Moscow defended the attacks. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Telegram Monday that it had targeted Ukraine's ""military command and energy systems."" ""The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continued strikes with high-precision, long-range air and sea-based weapons against Ukraine's military command and energy systems,"" it said. ""All assigned objects have been hit."" Kremlin says can't guarantee navigation safety after pulling out of grain deal In recent weeks, Russia has launched a barrage of attacks on Ukraine's power and heating infrastructure. Even before Monday's strikes, the situation was grave. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that about four million Ukrainians had power restrictions after attacks on energy infrastructure that day. Dmytro Sakharuk, executive director of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, said it's not possible to say how long outages will last following the latest strikes, while the necessary equipment to make repairs is also running low. Sakharuk told Ukrainian television: ""Unfortunately, we have already used up the stock of equipment that we had in our warehouses after the first two waves of attacks that have been taking place since October 10. We were able to purchase some equipment. But unfortunately, the cost of the equipment is now measured in hundreds of millions of dollars."" ""We are working on the ways to purchase it or get it from our partners. This is a problem for all power engineers. Cumulative losses as of yesterday are hundreds of millions of dollars for our company,"" he added. The assault on infrastructure is all part of a bigger plan by President Vladimir Putin, Melinda Haring, deputy director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council, told CNN last week. ""Putin's game plan is obvious: he wants to make this winter the coldest and darkest in Ukraine's history,"" she said. ""He will continue to strike infrastructure grids so as to knock out Ukraine's power and heat. His kamikaze drone attacks are meant to break the will of the Ukrainian people and to spark panic."" Some experts question how successful this strategy will be. Speaking to CNN, Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said: ""That Ukrainian air defences are successfully engaging some of the Russian cruise missiles being launched appears clear, what is less so are the claims regarding the exact numbers being intercepted, and the numbers getting through to the target. ""Conversely the number of air-launched cruise missiles that Russia still holds in its inventory has been reduced greatly, raising the question of how long it could continue to sustain such attacks."" Monday's attacks come after Russia suspended its participation in a United Nations-brokered grain deal viewed as key to addressing the global food shortage. Moscow announced it was leaving the deal on Saturday, blaming Ukraine for a drone attack on Crimea. Kyiv accused Russia of inventing ""fictitious terrorist attacks"" and using the deal as ""blackmail."" In a regular call with reporters on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Black Sea grain deal is ""risky"" and """,17,6.524698636657871,6.689180599706114,-0.16448196304824236,10

The second annual ""summit"" to counter ransomware will take a hard look at virtual currencies that facilitate cybercriminal profits and additional ways that companies and governments can fortify themselves against hacks, a senior administration official told reporters. The summit comes as a major US hospital network, CommonSpirit, continues to recover from a ransomware attack that has cut off some health providers' access to electronic health records. A separate ransomware attack over Labor Day weekend disrupted the computer systems of the Los Angeles Unified School District, one of the largest in the US. ""We're seeing the pace and the sophistication of the ransomware attacks increasing faster than our resilience and disruption efforts,"" the official said. FBI Director Christopher Wray, along with Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, will this week brief the visiting delegations on ransomware issues, according to the senior administration official. Canada, Singapore, Ukraine and the UK are among the many governments expected to participate. The summit will begin with a briefing from US intelligence and security agencies that highlights 4,000 cyberattacks in countries around the world over the last 18 months, the senior administration official said. Russia, where analysts believe many ransomware gangs find refuge, will be notably absent from the US-backed ransomware discussions for the second year in a row. In January, Russian authorities arrested the person whom US officials believed was behind the ransomware attack on a major US fuel pipeline operator last year. But Russia's February invasion of Ukraine has dampened hopes of any substantive cooperation on cybercrime between Washington and Moscow. Despite Russia's absence, the governments will address issues that implicate Moscow. That includes ""how we as a set of countries make it harder, costlier and riskier for ransomware actors to operate,"" the senior administration official said. This year, big tech firms such as Microsoft and SAP — which often have more data on cyberattacks than some government agencies — will also take part in the summit.",3,5.753473254755499,6.659961600477723,-0.9064883457222237,18
2022-10-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/29/europe/russian-army-ukraine-blake-cec/index.html,What causes armies to lose the will to fight? Here's what history tells us -- and what Putin may soon find out,"It was one of the strangest episodes in military history, an event so unusual that it was first treated as a myth. At 8:30 pm on Christmas Eve of 1914 in the dank and muddy battlefields of northern Europe during World War I, a British soldier dispatched a report to headquarters: German soldiers have illuminated their trenches and are singing carols while wishing British soldiers a merry Christmas. British officers ordered their men to be silent, but it was too late. A British soldier responded with his own chorus of ""The First Noel."" A German soldier called out across No Man's Land -- the barbed wire-strewn, deadly middle ground separating the armies -- ""Come out, English soldier; come out there to us."" The soldiers climbed out of their trenches and met in the middle. So did others, gathering to exchange chocolate, wine and souvenirs. They even organized a soccer game, which the Germans won 3-2. Most of the soldiers who shook hands on that fog-shrouded Christmas Eve would be dead before the war ended four years later. But letters from survivors and grainy black-and-white photographs prove it was no myth. An estimated 100,000 soldiers on both sides simply refused to fight because they were too exhausted and jaded. The Christmas Truce even lasted until New Year's in some places. ""By December 1914, the men in the trenches were veterans, familiar enough with the realities of combat to have lost much of the idealism that they had carried into war in August, and most longed for an end to bloodshed,"" according to an account of the Christmas Truce in Smithsonian Magazine. More than a century later, there's little chance that Russian and Ukrainian soldiers will shower each other with gifts this winter. But the Christmas Truce story is an example of a peculiar feature of war that offers a warning to the beleaguered Russian army in Ukraine: There are moments throughout history where entire armies suddenly stop fighting, though they are evenly matched or even numerically superior to their enemy. What causes armies to lose the will to fight? And how might that play out with the Russian army in Ukraine? This is the question that CNN asked combat veterans and military historians. While history is full of embattled armies like the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II, which fought with ferocious intensity even though they knew they would not win, it also records other armies that ""quiet quit"" — stopped attacking the enemy or did the bare minimum to stay alive. Russia's troops may be approaching that precipice, says Jeff McCausland, a combat veteran of the Gulf War and a visiting professor of international security studies at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. He says it's become clear that the Russian army is poorly trained and supplied, and that its soldiers in many cases have lost their will to fight. ""Fear and panic are more infectious than Covid"" for an army, says McCausland, co-author of ""Battle Tested! Gettysburg Leadership Lessons for 21st Century Leaders."" The sources for both fear and panic are varied. But McCausland and other historians say that throughout the history of warfare, there are at least three reasons why armies lose the will to fight. They lose faith in their cause McCausland has seen a broken army lose the will to fight up close. He says he commanded a battalion during the Gulf War in 1990-1991 and saw so many Iraqi soldiers surrender that his unit had trouble accommodating the prisoners. They ended up giving water to the captured soldiers and pointing them toward the rear. The war started when the Iraqi Army under Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. But many Iraqi soldiers simply didn't think Kuwait or Iraq's brutal leader were worth dying for. ""There was one instance where Iraqi soldiers surrendered to a drone that was circling over them,"" McCausland says. A more recent example of an army losing the will to fight came in Afghanistan. Amid the US military's withdrawal from the country in 2021, the Afghan National Army collapsed. They allowed the Taliban to quickly take control, even though the US had invested years and billions of dollars in training them. It was a low point for President Biden's administration. The reason for the Afghan army's complex surrender could be distilled in one question, McCausland says. ""If you asked a Taliban soldier, 'What the hell are you fighting for?' he would say I'm fighting to free my country from the crusaders, just like my grandfather freed the country from the Soviets and my great-great grandfather freed the country from the British. And I'm fighting for my religion, my country and my home,"" McCausland says. And if the same question was asked of an Afghan army soldier? ""He would say I'm fighting for a paycheck—if the company commander doesn't steal it."" The Taliban believed in their cause; the Afghan army didn't, says McCausland. They lose faith in their leaders Every war has its defining images. The Ukraine war has already yielded some unforgettable ones showing the contrast in leadership styles of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. Recent photos of Putin typically show him attired in a suit, alone at the head of an absurdly long conference table, in a large, sterile room, with a general or bureaucrat cowering at the other end. The caption could well read: ""paranoid and isolated dictator in action."" Contrast those images of Putin with those of Zelensky. One shows him standing resolute with his circle of advisers at night in Kyiv after vowing not to abandon the city even though he and his family were in danger. Other photographs show him in fatigues, buffed and bearded, swapping hugs with soldiers on the front lines. McCausland, who is also a national security consultant for CBS radio and television, says the images offer a lesson in leadership. ""Just look at both photos in terms of who would you like to work for,"" says McCausland, who offers leadership workshops to companies, non-profits and government institutions through his company, Diamond6. ""I don't care whether you're in the military or you're working for a corporation. It's pretty easy to decide."" Armies lose the will to fight when they lose faith in their leaders, McCausland and others say. They say soldiers don't expect generals or other leaders to hunker down in frontline trenches with them. But they want to know if their leaders care for them and respect their sacrifice. If you want to know how a leader can inspire an army to superhuman levels of endurance, consider this popular story from one of the greatest commanders in history: Alexander the Great. Alexander was leading his parched army through an unforgiving desert in pursuit of an enemy when scouts returned to him with a scoop of precious water in a helmet. They handed him the helmet in front of his army. Alexander thanked the soldiers and then, in full view of his troops, poured the water on the ground. He announced he would not take any water unless all his men had the same. His troops cheered. Alexander the Great never lost a battle. ""So extraordinary was the effect of this action that the water wasted by Alexander was as good as a drink for every man in the army,"" one chronicler would write later. They lose the backing of their country We hear commentators warn about the dangers of hyper-polarization in American politics, the corrupting power of unregulated and virtually untraceable ""dark money"" and the breakdown of civic norms. What many don't say is that these trends can become a national security issue in times of war. Put simply, an army can quit when their country becomes too corrupt or divided to support them. A classic example is the mass collapse of the South Vietnamese Army in the spring of 1975. The US military had been South Vietnam's big brother and benefactor for a decade as both countries fought the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese army. But the South Vietnamese government was riddled with corruption. Its leaders and their cronies siphoned off military aid to enrich themselves, and never built popular support among the populace they purportedly served. After the US military withdrew combat troops in 1973, the North Vietnamese army launched its final offensive on Saigon two years later. The South Vietnamese army refused to fight. News photos from that period show the army's equipment littering roadways as soldiers abandoned their units and attempted to hide among the civilian population, says Derek Frisby, a historian at Middle Tennessee State University. ""Once it looked like North was going to take over the South, there was nothing the South Vietnamese army could do about it,"" Frisby says. ""Once the Americans left, it [the loss of South Vietnam) seemed inevitable."" Wars aren't just fought by soldiers. They are fought by a country, and its people and its institutions. They are what historian Michael Butler calls ""social endeavors."" The health of a country's institutions - its government, military and media outlets -- matter just as much as a soldier's will to fight, says Butler, author of ""Selling a 'Just' War: Framing Legitimacy and U.S. Military Intervention."" Butler pointed to ""On War,"" the pioneering work by the 19th century Prussian military strategist Carl von Clausewitz, who wrote that the ""forces of passion"" are every bit as critical to a successful war effort as the military and the government."" If a government is corrupt and does not have the trust of the people, its armies can lose the will to fight, Butler says. He says that appears to be taking place in Russia, where society has long been afflicted by a ""societal malaise."" Its citizens have experienced the traumatic breakup of the Soviet Union, rampant corruption, political apathy, and the crushing of independent media and dissenting voices, he says. Political apathy has grown. The malaise afflicting civic Russia may be spreading to its military, he says, adding that the signs are already there in the thousands of men fleeing Russia to escape conscription. ""That's pretty compelling evidence that that the forces of passion are not really effectively locked into this war,"" says Butler, a political science professor at Clark University in Massachusetts. ""It's not surprising to see that playing out on the battlefield with troops who are deserting or disengaging."" The forces of passion now, though, seem to favor Ukraine. Its army's men and women (women soldiers serve in combat units in the Ukrainian military) know what they're fighting for. ""Ukrainians are motivated by perhaps the strongest force a soldier can have -- defense of their country, families and homes,"" McCausland says. The big question for Russian troops this winter The US military faced a crisis of morale half a century ago in Vietnam. American troops never surrendered during the Vietnam War. They never lost a major battle durin",14,5.797627340558613,6.068010636679064,-0.27038329612045153,24

In a social media post, Russian statesman and mayor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhayev said ""no facilities in the city were hit."" ""The situation is calm and under control. All operational teams are on standby,"" he said. Russian state news agency TASS reported that ferries and boats have been temporarily blocked from accessing the bay. CNN cannot independently confirm or verify Razvozhayev's claim. There has also been no acknowledgment of the incident from Ukraine's side. Sevastopol, along with the rest of Crimea, is internationally recognized as being part of Ukraine. It is the largest city in the peninsula and has been an important port and a major naval base for Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to ""liberate"" all of the country's territory including Crimea, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. The news comes amid the death of a Russian journalist working for a major Kremlin-backed media outlet, who was killed in a shooting accident at a military training ground in Crimea on Friday, Russian officials and state media said. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian official claimed on Friday that his country's troops are on the verge of controlling a key highway between the crucial towns of Svatove and Kreminna in the Luhansk region. Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, posted on social media late Friday that the road was ""practically under Ukrainian control."" The towns are major goals for the Ukrainian Armed Forces attempting to push east into Luhansk, which is predominantly under Russian occupation. CNN cannot independently verify the claim, but holding the road would deny Russia the ability to access Luhansk from the north. In a separate post Saturday morning, Hayday said Ukraine had conducted airstrikes on Russian positions and air defence systems. ""Missile and artillery units struck enemy positions where batteries of self-propelled artillery systems and other important military targets were located,"" Hayday said. This is a developing story.

2022-10-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/europe/potemkin-remains-removed-kherson-ukraine-russia-intl/index.html,Russia removes bones of 18th-century commander revered by Putin from occupied Ukrainian city,"Pro-Russian officials say they have removed the bones of famed 18th century Russian commander Grigory Potemkin from the occupied Ukrainian city of Kherson. Potemkin's bones were taken from St. Catherine's Cathedral and moved across the Dnipro River and further into Russian-held territory, along with a statue of the military leader, the region's pro-Russian proxy governor Vladimir Saldo told Crimean TV. ""We have moved the remains of His Serene Highness Prince Potemkin from St. Catherine's Church and the monument itself to the left [east] bank,"" Saldo said, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Potemkin played a critical role in the annexation of Crimea from the Turks in 1783, and his memory is central to those within Russia intent on restoring the country's former imperial reach. Putin largely leaned on his legacy for justifying the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Monuments to naval commander Fyodor Ushakov and commanders Alexander Suvorov and Vasily Margelov were also removed from the church and taken to an undisclosed location, Saldo said. The relics will be returned when the city is safer, he added. Prince Grigory Potemkin was a Russian 18th-century statesman, army general, a favorite and adviser to Empress Catherine the Great. His name has come up a few times in the Kremlin since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Most recently, in his speech at the ceremony for annexing new territories, Putin mentioned Potemkin as one of the founders of new towns in the Eastern part of Ukraine referring to the territory as Novorossiya which stands for ""New Russia."" Potemkin is believed to be behind the plan for the conquest of Crimea which was first annexed by Russia in 1783 as a result of a peace agreement with the Ottoman Empire. He was subsequently awarded the rank of field marshal and founded the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, making it the main Russian naval base on the Black Sea. Potemkin's newly built Black Sea fleet played an important role in Russia's success in the second Turkish war of 1768-1774. In Russia, Potemkin's name is most commonly associated with ""Potemkin villages,"" a term used to define cover-up facades designed specifically to hide an unsightly truth and create a false appearance of well-being. The phraseology goes back to a disproved historical myth of him arranging ostentatious decorations, such as allegedly putting up cardboard villages with painted ships and cannons, to impress Catherine the Great and her foreign companions during a trip to Crimea following its annexation. Attempts to retake Kherson The move to remove his remains were made as Ukrainian forces bear down on the city of Kherson, following a series of successful counter-offensives in the surrounding region. The situation in the city is ""tense"" with Russia stationing ""a large number of Russian soldiers"" there, a city official told Ukrainian TV on Friday. ""People in the occupied territories with whom I communicate say that there are more Russian soldiers on the city streets than the local residents,"" Halyna Luhova, a member of Kherson's city council, said. The UK's Ministry of Defence said in its daily intelligence update on Friday said it was ""likely"" that ""mobilized reservists"" had been sent to reinforce Russian troops in the regional capital and west bank. Over the past two weeks, Kherson's Kremlin-backed administration has broadcast dire messages about an impending Ukrainian attempt to retake the city, and ferried thousands of residents across the Dnipro River, deeper into Russian-held territory. Ukraine has accused Russia of generating ""hysteria"" to compel residents to leave. Moscow has also begun to reduce the footprint of its occupation in Kherson. Ukrainian officials say the Russians are moving injured people, administrative services and financial institutions out of the city, while sending in more troops to fortify their positions.

2022-10-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/europe/ukraine-refugees-return-warning-russia-energy-intl/index.html,Ukraine tells refugees not to return this winter as Russian strikes put energy grid in peril,"Ukraine has asked refugees who fled the country in the wake of Russia's invasion not to return home this winter, after Russian drone and missile strikes threatened to overwhelm the country's fragile power grid. Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, advised Ukrainians in a video message on Tuesday ""not to come back just yet."" ""We need to survive this winter. (If people come back) the electrical grid might fail,"" she said. The warning comes after weeks of strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which have caused blackouts across the country and threatened a difficult winter for those still living there. Russian missiles and Iranian-made drones have ""destroyed more than a third"" of Ukraine's energy sector, President Volodymyr Zelensky told an international conference on Ukraine reconstruction on Tuesday. ""You see what Russia is doing. Everybody sees that,"" Vereshchuk said. ""Coming back now means exposing yourself, your children, vulnerable relatives to this."" About 7.7 million people have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the war, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Most have resettled elsewhere in Europe, with Poland and Germany each recording the arrival of more than one million refugees. Vereshchuk hinted that they may be welcomed back once the winter has passed. ""In spring, I would really like for us to work together to rebuild our Kharkiv region, Kherson region and the rest of our cities and settlements here in Ukraine,"" she said. Vereshchuk added that she understood that the situation could get worse, but whatever happens, ""we survive this winter and then we think of everything else."" Power plants and other key sites have been targeted by Russian air strikes in recent weeks, which Moscow launched after seeing Kyiv's forces regain ground in the northeast and south, swinging the momentum of the ground war back toward Ukraine. ""We are particularly concerned about people in eastern and southern oblasts who have suffered relentless shelling for months, and have been left utterly traumatized -- their ability to cope is wearing thin,"" Anna Jefferys, a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told CNN. ""Of course, it is always the most poorest and most vulnerable who suffer the most. Many of those who did not flee attacks on their towns were the elderly, the disabled or the chronically sick, who felt they had no choice but to stay,"" Jefferys said. Addressing the meeting in Berlin by video link, Zelensky said the attacks were aimed at making ""it harder for us to endure this winter."" Speaking at the conference, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the strikes as ""pure acts of terror."" Moscow was ""deliberately leading targeted attacks on civilian infrastructure, with a very clear aim: to cut off men, women and children from water, electricity and heating as the winter is approaching,"" she said. ""These are pure acts of terror. Russia tries to paralyze Ukraine, but we will not let this happen."" Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for a ""new Marshall Plan"" to rebuild Ukraine, aimed at planning and financing the post-war reconstruction effort. ""We don't know when this war will end. But end it will,"" Scholz said, adding that helping Ukraine recover would be ""a challenge for generations"" and would require ""the combined strength of the entire international community.""",17,3.505695555901013,1.8754085781235144,1.6302869777774986,10
2022-10-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/europe/kherson-russian-soldiers-defend-city-intl/index.html,Russia pulls occupying officials out of Kherson as it braces for Ukrainian offensive,"A veil of uncertainty has descended over Ukraine's southern front, as a counteroffensive raises hopes of further Ukrainian gains and speculation grows about what Russia's next move might be. There are mixed signals over Russia's plans for the key city of Kherson, which it has occupied since the early days of the war. Some indications suggest Moscow is bracing for battle, while others point towards preparations for withdrawal. Over the past two weeks, Kherson's Kremlin-backed administration has broadcast dire messages about an impending Ukrainian attempt to retake the city, and ferried thousands of residents across the Dnipro River, deeper into Russian-held territory. Ukraine has accused Russia of generating ""hysteria"" to compel residents to leave. Moscow has also begun to reduce the footprint of its occupation in Kherson. Ukrainian officials say the Russians are moving injured people, administrative services and financial institutions out of the city, while sending in more troops to fortify their positions. One man still living in the city said Russia was withdrawing facilities for services like passports and pensions, and that he had seen fewer people and soldiers on the streets in recent days. ""There was a rotation and they brought in new soldiers,"" the man, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, told CNN on Sunday. ""Some of the soldiers who were here for a while, they left and the new [ones] came. Probably they are mobilized, conscripts. They don't even know what city they're in."" The Ukrainian military has observed similar Russian moves. ""They are moving their elite units and officers from the west bank (of the Dnipro River), leaving only those who are mobilized and expendable,"" Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's military, said on national television on Sunday. The start of the week was unusually quiet on the southern front. Russia launched two S-300 missiles at a residential neighborhood on the outskirts of Mykolaiv on Saturday night, injuring five. But Sunday and Monday nights brought no major drone or missile strikes. And on Tuesday, Ukraine's military claimed Russian forces were preparing ""defensive positions"" along the east bank of the Dnipro -- the opposite side of the river from Kherson city -- and leaving small pathways for a ""potential retreat"" from the west bank. ""According to available information, the enemy is arranging defensive positions on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson region,"" the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in its daily operational update. ""Near the settlement of Hornostaivka, engineering and sapper units of the Russian occupation troops are laying mines along the coastline, leaving small pathways for the potential retreat of their troops from the right (western) bank,"" the post continued. CNN could not confirm the Ukrainian military's claim. All of this has raised hopes among residents that Russia might be preparing to withdraw from the city and settle into more defensible positions further back for the difficult winter months ahead. Even vendors in the city's market have started asking for Ukrainian hryvnia, rejecting the occupiers' rubles and preparing for liberation, the resident told CNN. But on Monday, the head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency poured cold water on the idea that Kherson's liberation could be imminent, saying ""they are not preparing to leave now -- they are preparing to defend."" Russia is bringing fresh troops into Kherson to fortify the city from any fresh Ukrainian offensive, Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told Ukrainian media. ""They create the illusion that everything is gone,"" Budanov said. ""At the same time, on the contrary, they bring new military units there and prepare the streets of the city for defense."" On Monday night, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine had to prepare itself for a winter that ""will be the most difficult in our history."" Meanwhile, Kherson's Russian-installed leaders said in a post on Telegram Monday that ""the opportunity has been created"" for any men who stayed behind in the city to join the territorial defense forces. ""Those who wanted to leave, left,"" the Kherson resident told CNN. ""The (Ukrainian) people who are left here, they are united, they stick together, they ... try to help each other."" When the battle for Kherson could take place is unknown. Ukrainian forces have not made major advances toward the city since early October, when Zelensky said his troops had reclaimed around 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) in their push towards the city. As they have for weeks, Russia's proxy leaders in Kherson insist they will defend the city. ""Everything will be just fine,"" Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-backed deputy head of the region, said on Telegram Monday morning. ""We are not going to surrender Kherson. The city will become a grave for many Ukrainians who forgot the history lessons."" A baseless claim The sense of unease is heightened by Russia's recent histrionics. Without providing any evidence, Moscow has accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called dirty bomb. Western leaders have dismissed the accusation as a false flag operation which the Kremlin could use as a pretext to escalate the war. Ukraine has also accused Russia of preparing to blow up a major dam at a hydroelectric plant upstream from Kherson. Crucially, the dam and its surrounding area are controlled by Russia, and Zelensky said his government had information suggesting Russia had mined the structure. While the flood caused by blowing up the dam would widen Russia's defensive barrier if it withdrew, the disadvantages would far outweigh the strategic gains, Ukraine's defense intelligence chief said. Russia in turn has accused Ukraine of planning to attack the dam. ""They will get full flooding of the east bank of the Kherson region,"" Budanov said Monday. ""They will lose, even theoretically, the possibility of supplying water to the North Crimean Canal, to the Crimea, until we rebuild the dam, and that will take a very long time. It will be impossible to do."" ""And the most interesting thing is that they will destroy the possibility of existence of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, because this facility is inextricably linked with it."" Budanov still believes Kherson could be liberated by the end of the year, and that Russia is actively preparing for the possibility of withdrawing. ""They risk ending up in the same situation that our units in Mariupol found themselves in earlier,"" he said. ""The situation is a little different, but conceptually it will be very similar."" ""And understanding all this, they are preparing the ground so that, if necessary, they can get out of there very quickly."" Meanwhile in Kherson, the man CNN spoke to said he and the city's other remaining residents were stocking up on food and essentials, preparing for what could be a difficult period ahead. ""It's our city. We believe that we have to wait until our army comes,"" he said. ""I can't say we are not afraid, we are afraid -- but this our decision.""

""Now, we are also faced with the need to speed up resolution of the issues related to the provision of a special military operation and related to the fight against those restrictions in the economic sphere that we have encountered,"" Putin said Tuesday, speaking to the first meeting of the newly formed Coordination Council. Putin on October 20 created the Coordination Council headed by the country's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to meet the needs of the Russia's military campaign in Ukraine. Russia's goals cannot be met without ""broad and deep coordination between all areas of activity, all structures, all ministries, departments, both the power bloc and the economic bloc, and the regions of the Russian Federation. It is precisely for this that the Coordination Council was created,"" he added. The Russian leader warned that if Moscow's operation is carried out within the framework of ""standard bureaucratic procedures"" there will be ""no result,"" and stressed that Russian soldiers' equipment should be ""efficient and modern."" His comments on Tuesday appeared to acknowledge the difficulties Russia has faced since it launched the invasion, failing in its attempt to capture the Ukranian capital Kyiv. Prime Minister Mishustin said in the meeting that Russia's partial mobilization necessitated an increased production of clothing and protective equipment. Ukraine forces have in the meantime continued their advance against the Russian military, pushing through several parts of the Kherson region. Ukraine's military claimed Tuesday that Russian forces in occupied Kherson are preparing ""defensive positions"" along the east bank of the Dnipro river and leaving small pathways for a ""potential retreat"" from the western bank. CNN cannot confirm the Ukrainian military's claim. Russia has responded to Ukraine's counteroffensive with a relentless bombing campaign, striking energy and civilian infrastructure and sowing terror in Ukrainian cities far from the frontlines of the war. Moscow this week accused Ukraine, without evidence, of planning to use a so-called dirty bomb. The allegation has been dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies as a false-flag operation that Moscow could use as a pretext to escalate the Kremlin's war against its neighbor.",14,2.2591702935731264,5.534391322353516,-3.2752210287803893,8
2022-10-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/europe/norway-arrest-brazilian-russia-spy-intl/index.html,Norwegian police arrest 'Brazilian researcher' on suspicion of spying for Russia,"Police in Norway arrested an academic working at the University of Tromsø in the Arctic Circle on Monday, on suspicion of secretly spying for Russia, according to Norwegian public broadcaster NRK. Norway's police told NRK that the man, a researcher at the university, claims to be a Brazilian citizen but they suspect he could be using a false identity and could actually be a Russian citizen. ""We have asked that a Brazilian researcher at the University of Tromsø be expelled from Norway as we believe he represents a threat to fundamental national interests,"" said Hedvig Moe, Assistant Head, Norwegian Police Security Service, speaking to NRK. ""PST (Norwegian Police Security Service) is worried that he may have acquired a network and information about Norwegian politics of the northern area. Even if this network or the information gathered bit by bit is not a threat to the security of the kingdom, we are worried that the information could be misused by Russia,"" Moe added. CNN has reached out to the police force for comment. The agency did not reveal the man's name but said on its Twitter account that he was being held on suspicion of violating two sections of the Norwegian penal code, dealing with ""illegal intelligence"" that could ""damage fundamental national interests"" and ""security interests of other states."" PST said it was working closely with other countries' intelligence agencies as they work on the case. Russian authorities have yet to comment on the arrest but in an email to NRK the Russian embassy said they were not aware of the circumstances of the case and described it as part of the ""spy mania"" in Norway, where ""everything Russian ... is suspicious and smells of espionage."" The public broadcaster said the case is being treated as an immigration case, and the man's lawyer said he opposes the detention and ""does not agree with the basis for it."" He said he'd received ""very little concrete information on the case so far."" In July, Richard Moore, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence service MI6, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, European countries have expelled ""north of 400 Russian intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover"" across the bloc. The country has been on edge after a series of leaks in two Russian gas pipelines -- both of which run under the Baltic Sea near Sweden and Denmark -- that leaders of several countries said were the likely result of sabotage. The leaks happened just before the ceremonial launch of the Baltic Pipe carrying gas from Norway to Poland, a centerpiece of Warsaw's efforts to diversify from Russian supplies. In June, Dutch authorities said they had thwarted an attempt by a Russian spy to gain access to the International Criminal Court (ICC) by posing as an intern. They identified him as Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, a Russian military intelligence officer who in April traveled to the Netherlands to start an internship at the International Criminal Court (ICC). From there, he would have had a perch to spy on war crimes investigations into Russian military actions in Ukraine and elsewhere, sources say.",3,5.916193930920161,4.643363343438291,1.2728305874818702,3
2022-10-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/22/europe/russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/index.html,Ukrainian military says 18 Russian cruise missiles destroyed amid attacks on energy infrastructure,"The Ukrainian military said it used anti-aircraft missile units and mobile fire groups to destroy Russian cruise missiles during a string of attacks on energy infrastructure across the country Saturday morning. ""18 enemy cruise missiles were destroyed by aviation, anti-aircraft missile units and mobile fire groups,"" a post from the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said. ""In addition, the Russians attacked from ships in the Black Sea with Kalibr cruise missiles. A total of 16 starts,"" it continued. CNN cannot independently confirm the Ukrainian military's claims. Several rockets flying towards Kyiv on Saturday were shot down by air defense forces in the region, the city's Mayor Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said in a separate statement. A series of attacks across Ukraine Saturday left residents in parts of Odesa, Cherkasy, Kropyvnitsky, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Lutsk without electricity, according to officials in each region. The scale of the damage brought on Western Ukrainian power facilities is similar -- or could be worse -- than the effect of Russian attacks earlier in the month from October 10-12, the state-owned electricity transmission company Ukrenergo said. Russia has launched a series of attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks, striking civilian infrastructure and sowing terror in Ukrainian cities far from the frontlines of the war. The attacks have increased since the summer when, according to the United States and Kyiv, Moscow acquired suicide drones from Iran. On Friday, France called for a United Nations investigation into whether drones used in the attacks are being supplied by Tehran. ""We expect the UN experts to go on the ground and to collect the remains of these drones and to tell us where they are coming from. This is part of their mandate, they report twice a year and it has to be done,"" France's Ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Rivière, told reporters in New York on Friday. Iran's Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian on Saturday denied US and Western allegations of Iran having supplied drones to Russia to use against Ukraine, according to Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency. ""We condemn the allegations of giving drones to Russia in the Ukraine war. We are against war anywhere in the world,"" Abdollahian said following his meeting with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in Yerevan. Previously Iran has accused the West of running a disinformation campaign against it. Russia has also denied using Iranian drones, saying such claims are ""unsubstantiated inferences"" and ""far-fetched assumptions."" The French ambassador dismissed these denials, saying ""nobody is paying any attention to them"" and that ""the facts are crystal clear."" France views Russia's use of drones in Ukraine as ""a massive violation of international humanitarian law and international law,"" he added, saying that it also went against a UN resolution on Iran's nuclear program. His comments came after a UN Security Council meeting on the situation in Ukraine, held following requests by France and Mexico. CNN reported Tuesday that Iran has sent military personnel to Russian-occupied territory inside Crimea to train and advise the Russian military on the use of their drones, according to two sources familiar with US intelligence. Suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a loitering munition because they are capable of waiting for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only strike once an enemy asset is identified. They are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance. Ukrainian authorities say Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran and that it is rebranding and using the Shaheds under the name of ""Geran."" US officials say there has been ""some evidence already"" that the Iranian drones have ""experienced numerous failures"" on the battlefield. De Rivière, the French ambassador, said Moscow was changing its tactics and targeting civilian infrastructure because ""the Russian army is clearly in trouble on the ground."" ""Therefore, Russia has decided to increase its pressure on Ukrainian civilians to destroy energy facilities, hospitals, schools. Many cities in Ukraine have been targeted by the Russian artillery. This must clearly stop. ""So this is where we are, we need to talk, we need to discuss, we need to put this war to an end,"" de Rivière said, ""and the sooner, the better."" Attacks across Ukraine Just hours later, on Saturday, nearly 1,000 homes in the southern Ukrainian town of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk region were left without electricity after Russian shelling during the night severed power lines, according to governor Valentin Reznichenko. The city of Khmelnytskyi in western Ukraine also reported losing power, folllowing a series of explosions. Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation said air sirens were activated across the country, in all regions except Russian-annexed Crimea. The governor of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine said rockets had been seen overhead ""probably on [their way] to western and central Ukraine."" The governor of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine also warned residents of the ""threat of a rocket strike."" And in western Ukraine, the head of the Khmelnytskyi regional military urged residents to stay indoors amid reports of explosions. Parts of the Odesa region were without electricity following two missile strikes on an energy infrastructure facility Saturday, according to the head of the regional military administration Maksym Marchenko. Internet outages also occurred across Ukraine, NetBlocks, the global internet monitor, said.",17,6.422454829967169,2.3487402160981032,4.073714613869066,10
2022-10-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/europe/ukraine-russia-kherson-intl/index.html,Russia ramps up relocation of civilians in Kherson. It may soon lose one of the biggest prizes of its war,"The Russian-installed leaders in Ukraine's Kherson region on Wednesday began massively ramping up the relocation of up to 60,000 people amid warnings over Russia's ability to withstand a Ukrainian counter-offensive. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of generating ""hysteria"" to compel people to leave. Residents in the city of Kherson began to receive text messages on Wednesday morning from the pro-Russian administration. ""Dear residents,"" it read. ""Evacuate immediately. There will be shelling of residential areas by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. There will be buses from 7:00, from Rechport [River port] to the Left Bank."" Meanwhile on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he had signed a law introducing martial law in Kherson and three other Ukrainian regions the Kremlin claims to have annexed, in violation of international law. The other regions are Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk. In his first outing on Russian state television as the Kremlin's new commander for Ukraine, General Sergey Surovikin said Tuesday evening that the situation in Kherson was ""far from simple"" and ""very difficult."" ""Our further plans and actions towards the city of Kherson will depend on the military and tactical situation on the ground,"" he said. Ukrainian forces have been advancing through several parts of the Kherson region in recent weeks, capturing villages and farmland along the western bank of the Dnipro River, also known as the right bank. Russia's ability to resupply its troops in Kherson has been severely hampered by frequent Ukrainian missile and artillery strikes on Russian-controlled bridges crossing the Dnipro. The explosion earlier this month that badly damaged the Kerch bridge, which connects Russia to Crimea, further bottlenecked Russia's logistics. Last week the head of the Russian-backed administration appealed to the Kremlin to help with the evacuation of civilians near the frontline. On Tuesday, the rhetoric hit a new level. Just past 11 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET), Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-backed administration, posted a video to his Telegram channel. ""The Ukrainian Nazis pushed by the West will start their attack on Kherson very soon,"" he said. ""We are strongly advising to leave the right bank area."" This morning, just after 8 a.m., he followed that up with: ""Cross as quickly as possible onto the left bank [the eastern side] of river Dnipro."" Hours later, the Russian-backed administration went so far as to close off all entry to the right bank of the Dnipro River for seven days. Ukrainian officials believe that fewer than half of Kherson's civilian population are left in the city -- around 130,000 people. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-backed leader in the Kherson region, told Russian state television on Tuesday evening that they planned to move 50,000 to 60,000 people from the right to the left bank of the Dnipro River. The Ukrainian leaders-in-exile of the Kherson region accuse the Russia leaders of drumming up ""hysteria"" to intimidate the population and enact ""voluntary deportations"" to Russia, where they've been promised help with housing. ""On the one hand, we understand that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will liberate Kherson and the region -- accordingly, there may be active hostilities, and this is a risk for the local population,"" Yurii Sobolevskyi, deputy head of Ukraine's regional council for Kherson, told CNN on Wednesday. ""On the other hand, there are no guarantees that the evacuated people will be safe there and far from the front line. Now people make their own decisions -- to leave or stay. It is difficult to say what decision they will make."" The ""massive deportation of civilians"" by Russia could, along with other alleged abuses, constitute crimes against humanity, according to a July report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). In September, the UN Security Council also said Russia's forcible deportation of 2.5 million people from Ukraine -- including 38,000 children -- constitutes human rights violations. Ukraine denounced Russia's ""filtration"" scheme at a United Nations Security Council meeting last week. Deputy Ukrainian Ambassador to the UN Khrystyna Hayovyshyn said Ukrainians forced to head to Russia or Russian-controlled territory are being killed and tortured. Hayovyshyn told the Security Council that thousands of Ukrainian citizens are being forcefully deported to ""isolated and depressed regions of Siberia and the far east. Ukrainian citizens are terrorized, under the pretense of a search for ""dangerous"" people by Russian authorities, Hayovyshyn said. Those who have different political views or are affiliated with the Ukrainian government or media disappear into a gray area. Children are ripped from the arms of their parents, the Ukraine representative declared. Vital strategic city In the heady early days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when confusion reigned, the capture of the southern city of Kherson was a key strategic and propaganda victory for the Kremlin. On just the seventh day of the war, Kherson's mayor announced that Russian soldiers had entered his office, and the city had fallen. Geographically, it was vital: Kherson lies on the mouth of Ukraine's central artery, the Dnipro River, and not far from the canal that supplies water to Crimea. Ukraine's government had shut that canal down in 2014, when Russia illegally annexed the peninsula. It was the first major city Russia captured, and the only regional capital taken since February. (In addition to Crimea, Russian-backed forces have controlled Donetsk and Luhansk cities since 2014.) It's the second-biggest population center that Russia has captured after Mariupol. Seventh months later, the Kremlin considers the Kherson region to be part of Russia, after claiming to annex it last month. And yet, everyone from Russia's designated leaders in the region to the new commander of its entire Ukrainian war effort are sounding the alarm on their ability to withstand a Ukrainian offensive in the region. Russia's puppet administration has promised that there is no plan to abandon Kherson city, and that once the military ""solve all of the tasks,"" normal life will return. In his remarks on Russian television, Surovikin, the Russian commander, repeated what has become a bit of a trope in Russian circles: That the Ukrainian military was preparing to shell Kherson's city center, of even to strike the dam that's part of a hydroelectric plant at Nova Kakhovka, and unleash floodwaters on low-lying areas downstream. Ukrainian officials have dismissed that idea as Russian propaganda. It will not be easy for Ukraine to retake Kherson city if Russia seriously contests it, and the Ukrainian military will be reluctant to attack an urban center where tens of thousands of civilians could remain. But Ukraine's military brass remain bullish over the Kherson offensive. ""We will make significant progress by the end of the year,"" the head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, Major General Kyrylo Budanov, said on Tuesday. ""These will be significant victories. You will see it soon.""",14,3.2222675452443887,4.682560715067742,-1.4602931698233537,8
2022-10-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/europe/russia-mobilization-ending-ukraine-intl/index.html,Russia says its chaotic military draft is starting to wind down. Has it actually helped Putin?,"The ""partial mobilization"" of Russian citizens to fight in the country's war on Ukraine has been beset by errors, caused angry protests and prompted a mass exodus when it was announced last month. Now, as Russian officials suggest that the scheme will wind up soon, questions linger over whether the turmoil was really worth it for President Vladimir Putin. Roughly half of Russia's regions, including Moscow, had fulfilled their draft quota as of Tuesday, and the capital's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said that the city would close its draft offices. The Kremlin later said it has yet to set an end date for Putin's ""partial"" mobilization plan, which can only end with a presidential decree. ""There have been no such decisions on the end of mobilization,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that ""there can be no question"" of surpassing the targeted figure of 300,000 soldiers ""under current decree."" But the signs from Moscow suggest that at least the current phase of the divisive scheme is set to finish soon. ""Mobilization is ending. I assume in two weeks all mobilizing measures will be over,"" Putin said on Friday. It may be too early to tell whether the influx of soldiers can be considered a military success for Putin, who announced the plan after weeks of Ukrainian counter-offensives flipped the momentum in the conflict. But, to date, few parts of the plan can be considered a success. Since the president announced the drive last month, protests have erupted in ethnic minority regions, and some military enlistment offices have been set on fire. The announcement also sparked rare anti-war demonstrations across Russia. The country was forced to heighten security measures at military registration and enlistment offices ""due to increasing attacks"" on those facilities, a senior Russian official said on Saturday. Two gunmen said to be from former Soviet states opened fire on Russian military recruits that day during a training session in the Belgorod region, killing 11 people, state news agency TASS reported, citing the Russian Defense Ministry as a source. Alexander Khinshtein, a deputy in the Russian parliament, said on Telegram that many ""intruders"" have also been caught ""red-handed"" trying to launch an attack on military enlistment centers. A man opened fire at one such building late last month, seriously injuring a commander, state media reported. Meanwhile, countless Russians have fled the country since the plan was revealed. More than 200,000 people traveled from Russia into Georgia, Kazakhstan and the European Union in just the first week, collective data from those regions showed. ""I was angry and afraid,"" Vadim, who left Russia for Kazakhstan with his grandmother after the announcement, told CNN this month. ""We don't want this war ... we can't change something in our country, though we have tried."" While the setbacks have been numerous, the early benefits seem dubious. It is unclear whether the influx of newly-trained recruits has had any impact in ground fighting in eastern and southern Ukraine, where Kyiv has seen gains in recent weeks. ""In reality the mobilisation was having greater effects on negative political stability at home than it was ever going to have in positive term (for the Russians) on the battlefield,"" Mike Martin, an author and War Studies visiting fellow at King's College London, wrote in a lengthy Twitter thread Sunday. ""We've already seen some of those mobilised civilians dying on the battlefield in Ukraine ... with no training ... a criminal pointless waste of life,"" Martin said. The scheme appears to also be weighing down Russia's ability to quickly train and equip fighters, canceling out any boosts in manpower that the new recruits may have provided. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) suggested that a one-month delay in Russia's usual autumn conscription cycle, due to begin on November 1, was ordered because its ""partial mobilization is taxing the bureaucracy of the Russian military commissariats that oversee the semiannual conscription cycle."" ""Putin therefore likely needs to pause or end his partial mobilization to free up bureaucratic resources for conscription,"" the ISW said. The UK's Ministry of Defence agreed that the ""late start to the cycle is an indication of growing pressures on Russia's ability to train and equip a large number of new conscripted personnel."" ""The challenges of accommodating, training, equipping and deploying mobilised and conscripted personnel are significant,"" the ministry said. ""Deficiencies within the Russian administrative and logistical systems will continue to undermine these efforts."" For many observers, the frantic mobilization represented another miscalculation by a Russian president desperate to turn the tide in a war that has proven difficult for Moscow's forces. Former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev told CNN last week that ""terror is the only thing left"" for Putin, ""like for any miserable terrorist in the world."" Kozyrev detailed what he thinks are Putin's ""three major miscalculations"": ""One, that Ukraine could be defeated in two, three days. Second, that the United States and the West will not come to the rescue to help Ukrainians. And third, that he brought the war back home when he announced this mobilization."" ""He's desperate and he returns to what he's doing -- intimidation,"" Kozyrev said.",14,2.9854199162089605,4.722445732639437,-1.7370258164304762,24

""Another kind of Russian terrorist attacks: targeting energy & critical infrastructure. Since Oct. 10, 30% of Ukraine's power stations have been destroyed, causing massive blackouts across the country,"" Zelensky tweeted Tuesday. He added that there was ""no space left for negotiations with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's regime."" The Russian Defense Ministry later confirmed that the country's military had launched high-precision strikes on ""energy systems"" in Ukraine. ""During the day, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continued to strike with long-range high-precision air and sea-based weapons on military command and energy systems of Ukraine, as well as arsenals with foreign-made ammunition and weapons, all designated targets were hit,"" Lieutenant-Colonel Igor Konashenkov said Tuesday. The death toll in Kyiv continues to climb this week, officials said. At least five people were killed Monday following Russian attacks with Iranian-made ""kamikaze"" drones and at least three people died in separate strikes on Tuesday. 'Save water as much as possible' Moscow has targeted key Ukrainian power facilities in recent days, leaving areas in at least three cities without power. A residential neighborhood in the capital Kyiv is experiencing power cuts and water outages, local energy company DTEK said on Facebook Tuesday. ""Russian shelling has damaged a critical infrastructure facility in the Desnyansky district, causing interruptions in the electricity supply to the residents of the Troyeshchyna residential district and the water channel that supplies water to the Left Bank of the capital,"" the company said. In Dnipropetrovsk region, at least three areas, including parts of Dnipro city, experienced electrical outages and a water pumping facility lost power after Russia launched two missiles at an energy facility, causing ""fire and severe destruction,"" according to local authorities. A CNN team in Dnipro saw from a distance the aftermath of a hit on a power plant in Dnipro and smoke rising from the facility. Further west, the mayor of Zhytomyr said in a statement that the city was experiencing power and water cuts, with hospitals running on back up energy. Residents in the Ukrainian capital were also urged by local officials to limit electricity and water usage, after two key infrastructure complexes were hit on Tuesday. ""Currently, the provision of electricity and water supply services is partially limited in many houses on the left bank of the capital ...

This can lead to frostbite, hypothermia, pneumonia, stroke and heart attack,"" Hans Henri P. Kluge, the WHO's regional director for Europe, said Friday.

2022-10-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/europe/russia-ukraine-belarus-troops-intl-cmd/index.html,"Ukraine looks anxiously towards its northern border, and a fresh influx of Russian troops into Belarus","The announcement last week by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko that his country and Russia would form a joint regional force and carry out exercises set off alarm bells in Kyiv. The last time Belarusian and Russian forces held joint exercises, in February, many of those Russian forces went on to cross the Ukrainian border in their ill-fated drive towards the capital. It's not that Belarus has a mighty army -- it doesn't. But the prospect of Ukraine's long northern border becoming a passageway for Russian forces for the second time this year would be a nightmare for Ukraine's already stretched forces. Ukraine and Belarus share a 1,000-kilometer frontier, much of it sparsely populated and thickly forested. The first group of Russian soldiers to join the new force with Belarusian troops arrived in Belarus Saturday, Minsk's defense ministry said. Altogether, the Russian contingent will be less than 9,000 people, according to the head of the Belarus Department of International Military Cooperation, Valery Revenko. At the moment, the Ukrainian army is conducting offensives in the east and south while holding off Russian forces in parts of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. After seven months of war, the Ukrainian military has suffered attrition just like its enemy: moving forces to defend its northern flank would stretch forces already fighting on multiple fronts. Predictably enough, Belarus says the joint force is purely defensive. The country's Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said that ""all activities carried out at the moment are aimed at providing a sufficient response to activities near our borders."" Those activities, according to Belarus, are aimed at deterring Ukrainian preparations to attack the country. Lukashenko said last week that his government had been ""warned about strikes against Belarus from the territory of Ukraine."" Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei followed up Friday, saying an anti-terrorist operation was underway ""amid reports of impending provocations by nearby states."" Ukraine has vehemently denied the claims. The Foreign Ministry said it ""categorically rejects these latest insinuations by the Belarusian regime. We cannot rule out that this diplomatic note may be part of a provocation on the part of the Russian Federation."" President Volodymyr Zelensky told a meeting of the G7 group of the world's advanced economies last week that UN peacekeepers should be sent to the border. ""Russia is trying to directly draw Belarus into this war,"" Zelensky told the G7. There's certainly been much more movement of military hardware on the railways of Belarus. Social media videos have shown multiple rail convoys of tanks and other equipment moving across the country. The markings on one convoy were from the Moscow military region. Analysts think it's probable that much of this hardware belongs to Russia and is being retrieved from stocks in Belarus to make up for the losses Russian forces have suffered in Ukraine, especially last month. Less likely: that this spasm of activity indicates that Belarus is preparing to enter the fray. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last week the US had not seen indications that Belarusian troops ""are preparing to go in or will go in ... Any additional troops under Russian command is something to be concerned about, but we're just not there yet."" Despite often bombastic rhetoric, Lukashenko has not committed his forces to Russia's Special Military Operation, and most analysts believe that even if he did it would make little difference. Konrad Muzyka, an independent defense analyst based in Poland, follows the Belarus military closely and believes they are ""relatively weak."" Muzyka said on Twitter: ""The Belarusian Armed Forces are largely a mobilizational force. Their manpower is at around 50-60% of the required peacetime strength."" To reach full strength, they'd need to mobilize at least 20,000 men, Muzyka added. That would be a warning sign. But Lukashenko repeated last week that Belarus was not planning to announce any mobilization. Unlike Russian forces, the Belarus military rarely conducts exercises above battalion level. But it has had a high level of exercises this year; another was announced last week. Serhii Naiev, the commanding officer of Ukraine's Joint Forces, said last week: ""That is another demonstration of their readiness and an artificial increase in the level of tension."" Analyst Muzyka imagines three scenarios: the exercises are designed to prepare for an attack by NATO states; they aim to tie up Ukrainian forces along the border; or are preparations for an assault on Ukraine. The first is not going to happen; the last option would be immensely unpopular in Belarus, where there is nowhere near the level of animosity towards Ukraine that has been whipped up in Russia. But it's in Moscow's interests that the Ukrainians worry about their northern border, not least because of its proximity to Kyiv. Naiev says Belarus is already important for Russian missile stacks. Ukraine estimates there are four ballistic missile systems there and 12 S-400 surface-to-air systems, and some Iranian-made drones came from the north last week. More Russian combat planes have also begun arriving in Belarus, according to the Belarusian Defense Ministry. Ukrainian officials estimate there are as few as 1,000 Russian troops in Belarus at the moment. But a surge would ""create a threat of a repeated offensive in the Northern operational zone, in particular on the city of Kyiv,"" Naiev said. Despite the recent partial mobilization in Russia, the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) believes the Russian military is -- at the moment -- incapable of forming another phalanx to attack Ukraine from the north. ""Russian forces continue to attrit their own combat capabilities as they impale themselves on attempts to capture tiny villages in Donbas and simply do not have the combat-effective mechanized troops available to supplement a Belarusian incursion into northern Ukraine,"" the ISW said Friday Lukashenko has trodden a fine line throughout the conflict -- supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""special military operation"" without committing his own troops. Last week, he said, ""We are participating (in the operation). We do not hide it. But we are not killing anyone. We are not sending our military anywhere. We do not violate our obligations."" However, his room for maneuver may be shrinking. The mass protests that erupted after his disputed re-election in 2020 left Lukashenko ever more reliant on Moscow. As the Kremlin's need for some ""wins"" in Ukraine becomes more urgent, its ally to the west may find itself under growing pressure to collaborate. But at the same time, Lukashenko will want to avoid the risk of his untested troops getting mauled in Ukraine as he is vulnerable to further domestic unrest if his security forces are distracted or weakened.",14,5.938093974443981,6.036168731994022,-0.09807475755004091,0
2022-10-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/europe/kyiv-kamikaze-drone-strikes-intl/index.html,"Russia launches 'kamikaze' drone attack on Kyiv, killing 4 and hitting civilian infrastructure","Ukrainian officials said at least four people were killed when Russia launched a barrage of Iranian-made ""kamikaze"" drone attacks in Kyiv on Monday, setting off warning sirens across the capital. Four people were injured in the attacks and 19 people trapped under the destruction have been rescued, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior official working for Ukraine's president. The strikes on Kyiv appear to be part of a wider assault involving drones and cruise missiles aimed at critical infrastructure, especially power sources. The Ukrainian Air Force said it had destroyed 37 Iranian-made kamikaze drones and three cruise missiles in the south and east of the country early Monday. Ukraine Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi said that security forces were able to shoot down 36 of 42 drones that Russia launched on Monday. Around 30 of the drones targeted Kyiv, Monastyrskyi said on Ukrainian television. Fresh attacks in the eastern regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy targeted crucial infrastructure. Three people in Sumy were killed by rockets, nine were wounded and 1,625 were left without power, a local military official said. Energy infrastructure was damaged in central and northern regions of Ukraine, but the power grid was ""under control,"" the state energy utility Ukrenergo said in a statement on Facebook. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal asked citizens to reduce power consumption, especially during peak hours, to help stabilize the country's electricity system. In Kyiv, blasts were heard as early as 6:45 a.m. local time, including one in the city's Shevchenkivskyi district. Kyiv was hit five times, Shmyhal said. One of the strikes hit close to Kyiv's main train station, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs. Authorities have asked people to stay indoors. Later on Monday, officials said Kyiv region's air defense was actively responding to another Russian drone attack. ""Air defense system is working above our city so I strongly recommend everyone to stay in shelters,"" Volodymyr Borysenko, the mayor of Boryspil, which is on the outskirts of city, said on Facebook. ""Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said. ""The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us. The occupiers will get only fair punishment and condemnation of future generations. And we will get victory."" Russia's Defense Ministry on Monday said it had launched high-precision weapons at military energy targets across Ukraine aimed military and energy targets. Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are small, portable aerial weapon systems that are hard to detect and can be fired at a distance. They can be easily launched and are designed to hit behind enemy lines and be destroyed in the attack. One of the people killed in the capital was a woman who was six months pregnant, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a statement. Klitschko also told CNN's Clarissa Ward that Russian forces were targeting infrastructure to ""switch off the electricity"" ahead of the winter months. 'A flash and an explosion' Vitalii, a Kyiv man in his 20s, witnessed one attack after he had just arrived at a railway station. ""We saw a flash and an explosion. We went to the basement,"" said Vitalii, who declined to give last name for safety reasons. Vitalii and others sought shelter for about two hours. When the coast appeared clear, they attempted to leave -- only to see another blast. Vitalii said he and others recognized the triangular shape of the Iranian-made drone and how it buzzed. ""There was another explosion,"" he said. ""Everyone went back to the basement. People were running, screaming. There was panic. People were scared because they didn't understand what was going on."" Once the situation eventually calmed after the second blast, Vitali took a taxi and left. Monday's assault comes a week after Russia began an intense, two-day nationwide bombardment of Ukraine that killed at least 19 people and leveled civilian targets, drawing global outrage. The strikes also caused major damage to power systems across Ukraine, forcing people to reduce consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said there was no need for more ""massive"" strikes for now. However, a series of Russian attacks over the weekend killed 11 civilians -- eight in the eastern region of Donetsk, two in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and one in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. The city of Zaporizhzhia was attacked with kamikaze drones and missiles on Saturday, while Kyiv was hit by an apparent Russian rocket.",17,3.994684806205934,1.85197669934373,2.142708106862204,10

2022-10-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/15/europe/russian-general-surovikin-profile-intl-cmd/index.html,'They hated him.' Former subordinate recalls serving under Russia's new top commander in Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's devastating war on Ukraine is faltering. Now, there's a new general in charge -- with a reputation for brutality. After Ukraine recently recaptured more territory than Russia's army took in the last six months, Russia's Ministry of Defense last Saturday named Sergey Surovikin as its new overall commander for operations in the war. Notably, he previously played an instrumental role in Russia's operations in Syria -- during which Russian combat aircraft caused widespread devastation in rebel-held areas - as Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces. CNN spoke to a former Russian air force lieutenant, Gleb Irisov, who served under him in Syria. He said Surovikin was ""very close to Putin's regime"" and ""never had any political ambitions, so always executed a plan exactly as ​the government wanted."" Analysts say Surovikin's appointment is highly unlikely to change how Russian forces are carrying out the war but that it speaks to Putin's dissatisfaction with previous command operations. It is also, in part, likely meant to ""mollify"" the nationalist and pro-war base within Russia itself, according to Mason Clark, Russia Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think-tank. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has called for Russia to ""take more drastic measures​"" ​including the use of ""low-yield nuclear weapons"" in Ukraine following recent setbacks, welcomed the appointment of Surovikin, who first saw service in Afghanistan in the 1980s before commanding a unit in the Second Chechen War ​in 2004. Praise from Kadyrov, who is ​a key Putin ally, is significant, perhaps, as he himself is notorious for crushing all forms of dissent. ""I personally ​have know​n Sergei very well for almost 15 years. I can definitely say he is a real general and warrior, experienced, headstrong and foresighted commander who always takes patriotism, honor and respect above all,"" Kadyrov posted on social media, following news of Surovikin's appointment last Saturday. ""The united army group is now in safe hands,"" he added. 'They hated him' Irisov, Surovikin's former subordinate, left his five-year career in the armed forces after his time in Syria because his own political views conflicted with what he experienced. ""Of course, you understand, who is right and who is wrong,"" Irisov said. ""I witnessed a lot of stuff, being inside the system."" Irisov then began what he hoped would be the start of a career as an international journalist, as a military reporter with Russian state news agency TASS. His wife worked there and he felt at the time it was ""the only main information agency"" that tried to ​cover news in an ""unbiased"" way, with ""some opportunity of freedom of speech,"" he said. ""Everything changed"" on February 24, 2022, when Putin's invasion of Ukraine began and TASS received orders from the FSB security service and defense ministry ""that everyone will be prosecuted if they don't execute the propaganda scheme,"" Irisov said. He had family in Kyiv, hiding in bomb shelters, and told CNN he knew ""nothing could justify this war."" He also knew from his military contacts that there were already many casualties in the first days of the war. ""For me it was obvious from the beginning,"" Irisov recalled. ""I tried to explain to people this war will lead to the collapse of Russia... it will be a great tragedy not only for Ukrainians but also for Russia."" Irisov fled Moscow with his pregnant wife and young child on March 8, 2022, after standing against the invasion. He had quit his job at TASS and signed petitions and an open letter against the war, he told CNN. After traveling to Armenia, Georgia, Turkey and finally Mexico, where they contacted the US embassy to ask for help, they are now working to start a new life in West Virginia. While serving at Latakia air base in Syria in 2019 and 2020, the 31-year-old says he worked on aviation safety and air traffic control, coordinating flights with Damascus' civilian airlines. He ​says he saw Surovikin several times during some missions and spoke to high-ranking officers under him. ""He made a lot of people very angry -- they hated him,"" Irisov said, describing how the ""direct"" and ""straight"" general was disliked at headquarters because of the way he tried to implement his infantry experience into the air force. Irisov says he understands Surovikin had strong connections with Kremlin-approved private military company the Wagner group​, which has operated in Syria. The Kremlin denies any connections to Wagner and insists that private military companies are illegal in Russia. Awarded 'hero' title Surovikin, whose military career began in 1983, has a checkered history, to say the least. In 2004, according to Russian media accounts and at least two think tanks, he berated a subordinate so severely that the subordinate took his own life. And a book by the think tank the Washington DC-based Jamestown Foundation says that during the unsuccessful coup attempt against former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991, soldiers under Surovikin's command killed three protesters, leading to Surovikin spending at least six months in prison. CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment on Surovikin's appointment and regarding allegations about his harsh leadership. In a 2020 report, Human Rights Watch named him as ""someone who may bear ​command responsibility"" for the dozens of air and ground attacks on civilian objects and infrastructure in violation of the laws of war​"" during the 2019-2020 Idlib offensive in Syria. ​The attacks killed at least 1,600 ​civilians and forced the displacement of an estimated 1.4 million people, according to HRW​​, which cites UN figures. During his time in Syria, the ​now-56-year-old was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation. In February this year, Surovikin was sanctioned by the European Union in his capacity as head of the Aerospace Forces ""for actively supporting and implementing actions and policies that undermine and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine as well as the stability or security in Ukraine."" Irisov believes there are three reasons why he has been put in charge in Ukraine now: his closeness to the government and Putin; his interbranch experience with both the infantry and air force; and his experience since the summer commanding Russian forces in the southern Ukrainian regions of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Crimea. These are areas that Putin is trying to control ""at any cost,"" said Irisov. Just two days after Surovikin's appointment on Saturday, Russia launched its heaviest bombardment of Ukraine since the early days of the war. Surovikin is ""more familiar with cruise missiles, maybe he used his connections and experience to organize this chain of devastating attacks,"" Irisov said​, referencing the reports that cruise missiles have been among the weapons deployed by Russia in this latest surge of attacks. But Clark, from the ISW, suggests the general's promotion is ""more of a framing thing to inject new blood into the Russian command system"" and ""put on this tough nationalist face."" His appointment ""got widespread praise from various Russian military bloggers as well as Yevgeny (Prigozhin), who's the financier of the Wagner Group,"" Clark said. He believes what's happening now is a reflection of what happened in April, when another commander, Alexander Dvornikov, was appointed overall commander of the operations in Ukraine. ""Similarly, he before then was a commander of one of the groupings of Russian forces and had sort of a master reputation in Syria much like Surovikin for brutality, earning this sort of name of the 'butcher of Aleppo,'"" Clark said. Dvornikov was also seen at the time as the commander ""that was going to turn things around in Ukraine and get the job done,"" he added. ""But an individual commander is not going to be able to change how tangled Russian command and control is at this point in the war, or the low morale of Russian forces."" Andrea Kendall-Taylor, director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, also told CNN this week that Surovikin's appointment ""reflects the ascendancy of a lot of hardline voices inside Russia... calling on Putin to make changes, and to bring in someone who would be willing to execute these ruthless attacks."" Clark reasons that ""from what we've seen, it's highly ​probable that Putin is involved in decision-making down to a very tactical level and in some cases bypassing the senior Russian military officers to interact directly on the battlefield."" Surovikin personally signed Irisov's resignation papers from the air force, he says. Now, Irisov sees him put in charge of operations in Putin's brutal war in Ukraine -- but what impact the general will or can have is not yet clear. According to Clark, ""there isn't a good Kremlin option if Surovikin doesn't perform or if Putin decides that he is also not up to the task. There aren't many other senior Russian officers and it's just going to lead to a further degradation of the Russian war effort.""",14,3.2276568371540915,6.111014536081518,-2.8833576989274263,24

In the Zaporizhzhia region, two people died and one was injured. In the Kharkiv region, one civilian died, another was injured. Two people were injured in the Dnipro region, while one was injured in the Kherson region, the official said. Zaporizhzhia was struck by ""10 or more"" C300 missiles Saturday morning, following four strikes by ""kamikaze"" drones overnight, said Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia's regional military administration. The city's acting mayor Anatoliy Kurtev also reported what he referred to as an ""insidious attack on Zaporizhzhia with kamikaze drones"" in a Telegram post. Kamikaze drones or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a loitering munition because they are capable of waiting for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only strike once an enemy asset is identified. The Ukrainian military and US intelligence say Russia is using Iranian-made attack drones in Ukraine. US officials told CNN in July that Iran had begun showcasing Shahed series drones to Russia at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran the previous month. The drones are capable of carrying precision-guided missiles and have a payload of about 50 kilograms (110 pounds). The city of Zaporizhzhia houses Europe's largest nuclear plant and shelling in the area has previously sparked fears of a nuclear disaster. Attacks elsewhere in Ukraine The apparent attacks on the city came as Ukrainian officials claimed the capital Kyiv had been hit by an apparent Russian rocket. Civilians in and around the capital, Kyiv were warned to remain in shelters until air raid sirens stopped. ""All services are working, rescue teams are on site,"" said the head of Kyiv regional state administration Oleksiy Kuleba in a Telegram post. ""Stay in your shelters until the air raid sirens stop. Do not record the place of impact and do not post photos and videos on social networks."" A major energy infrastructure facility in the Kyiv region was also left severely damaged after a Russian missile attack early Saturday, according to Ukraine's energy operator. Ukrenergo warned about the possibility of rolling blackouts on Telegram, urging local residents to save electricity from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. local time Saturday so specialists could carry out essential restoration work. Russian shelling on the frontline killed at least one person and left another three injured over the past day. A 66-year-old civilian was killed by shelling in Kharkiv district close to the Russian border, according to a military official. Moscow also bombarded the settlements of Kharkiv, Izyum, Kupiansk and Chuhuyiv districts, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Adminstration, Oleh Syniehubov, said on Telegram. A 74-year-old man was also injured in the Kupiansk district. Houses and commercial buildings were damaged in Vovchansk, where fires broke out due to shelling. Separately, a 65-year-old man was seriously injured when his car ran over a mine in the Chuhuyiv district, Syniehubov added. Further south, Russian shelling in the Dniper-river town of Nikopol left a 35-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman hospitalized, according to a military official. Critical infrastructure including high-rise buildings, a transport company and several shops and offices were struck, according to Valentyn Reznichenko, head of the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Military Administration.",17,6.527068492589403,3.8801270919752646,2.6469414006141383,29

The claim follows data released by a panel of UN experts recently that verified ""more than a hundred cases"" of rape or sexual assault incidents reported in Ukraine since February. ""When you hear women testify about Russian soldiers equipped with Viagra, it's clearly a military strategy,"" Pramila Patten, UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, said in an interview with AFP on Thursday. She added that many cases involved children and also said that the true number of victims was likely to be far higher than official figures suggested because sexual crimes are often ""under reported."" ""There are many cases of sexual violence against children who are raped, tortured and sequestered,"" Patten said. ""I have not stopped since February to emphasize the importance of having credible investigations into these cases of violence."" Since the Russian invasion began, Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Moscow's forces of sexually abusing women and children, claiming they are using rape and other sexual acts as weapons of war. Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Kateryna Pavlichenko in June said that police received around 50 complaints of sexual crimes committed by Russian soldiers. Prosecutors are also investigating rape allegations in the Kharkiv region after Ukrainian forces recently recaptured territory there. CNN has spoken with Ukrainian women, one of them a pregnant 16-year-old, who shared harrowing accounts detailing sexual assault. CNN could not independently verify the latest claims by the UN.

2022-10-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/europe/russia-putin-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Putin has 'no regrets' over missile barrage in Ukraine, but says no need for more 'massive' strikes for now","Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday he had ""no regrets"" over his deadly missile attacks on civilian targets across Ukraine earlier this week, but said there was no need for more ""massive"" strikes for now. The wave of missile attacks on cities across Ukraine began on Monday in response to a blast on a strategically vital bridge connecting the annexed Crimean Peninsula to Russia over the weekend. It's unclear what caused the explosion, but Putin on Monday blamed it on Kyiv and called it a ""terrorist attack"" that could not be left unanswered. The intense bombardment that followed over the next two days killed at least 19 people and leveled civilian targets across the country, drawing global outrage. The strikes also caused major damage to power systems across Ukraine, forcing people to reduce consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. Putin said that while he did not regret the strikes and believes that Russia's actions were correct, he did recognize that ""what is happening now is unpleasant."" Putin also defended his partial mobilization of Russians that began in September, telling reporters it is expected to end in two weeks and that some 222,000 troops had already been drafted into the army. The mobilization got off to a chaotic start last month, sparking rare protests throughout the country. Hundreds of thousands of people -- mostly fighting-age men -- fled Russia, pouring into neighboring countries like Georgia and Kazakhstan to avoid conscription. Putin also said that Russia does not seek to ""destroy"" Ukraine, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Western leaders have previously alleged. His comments come seven months after Russia launched a full-scale invasion and as Moscow attempts to annex four Ukrainian regions in violation of international law. The Russian leader was speaking at a rare news conference in Astana, Kazakhstan, where Putin had traveled for a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a regional intergovernmental organization made up of former Soviet states. When asked if he would meet with US President Joe Biden, Putin told a reporter that he ""does not see the need for negotiations."" Biden was asked a similar question in an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this week. The US President said he did not see ""any rationale"" for meeting his Russian counterpart, though he said he would perhaps make an exception to discuss the fate of imprisoned American basketball star Brittney Griner. Russian setbacks in Kherson Russian authorities said civilian evacuations would begin Friday in the occupied southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, where the Kremlin has suffered a string of defeats at the hands of Ukrainian forces. Further to the east, Russia's embattled forces have managed to make some small gains in Donetsk, toward the city of Bakhmut, aided in large measure by Wagner mercenaries, or private military contractors. Moscow likely views the city a jumping-off point toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk -- the largest urban areas held by Ukraine in Donetsk, the British Defense Ministry said. Bakhmut is currently under Ukrainian control, but it has been bombarded by Russian artillery for months. Reports from pro-Russian analysts and in Russian state media alleged that Kyiv had begun withdrawing some forces from the city, but CNN could not independently verify those claims. Ukrainian officials have not commented on them, but they have noted that Bakhmut is being fiercely contested. Meanwhile, the outlook for Russian forces in Kherson and the northeastern region of Luhansk remain bleak. Kyiv has continued to make significant gains along the western side of the Dnipro River, a major waterway that flows across Ukraine and Eastern Europe, as they push toward the city of Kherson. Fighting near Kherson city continued to rage on Friday. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-backed administration in Kherson, said Moscow's forces were ""courageously and professionally holding back the daily attempts of the militants of the Kyiv regime to break through the defenses."" Though Stremousov said civilians should be at a ""safe distance from the hostilities"" and that Kherson residents appeared to have begun evacuating. The governor of the eastern Russian region of Rostov, Vasily Golubev, said Thursday that local authorities were preparing to receive residents of Kherson fleeing the front lines, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Golubev said the first group of evacuees would arrive on Friday. Golubev's comments came after Russia's deputy prime minister confirmed Moscow would assist with evacuation efforts, heeding calls from the head of the Kremlin-backed administration in Kherson who had pleaded for help. There is now concern that Ukrainian citizens in occupied territory may be forced to go to Russian territory against their will. Reports emerged early in the war of tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians being forcibly sent to so-called ""filtration centers"" before being moved to Russia. Moscow denounced the claims as lies, alleging that Ukraine has hindered its efforts to ""evacuate"" people to Russia. But allegations of these centers stirred painful memories of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's forced deportation of millions from their homelands. Over the summer, Ukrainian officials in the contested region of Zaporizhzhia appealed to citizens who were in Russian-occupied territory to move away from front lines and into other Ukrainian-controlled territory. If that option was not possible, they advised Ukrainians to use Crimea or Russian territory as a transit route toward Ukraine or a friendly country. Those on the frontlines in Kherson are now being advised by Ukrainian officials to avoid traveling to Russia altogether. ""Under no circumstances should you go to the Russian Federation,"" warned Oleksandr Samoylenko, a top Ukrainian official in the Kherson region, on Friday. Samoylenko said that Ukrainian forces were only targeting Russian positions and equipment using high-precision weapons. Samoylenko's and his deputy, Yurii Sobolevskyi, both accused Russia of trying to Ukrainian citizens out of the region so they could repopulate it with ""zombies who are 100% loyal to Moscow."" Sobolevskyi alleged that a similar scheme was carried out in Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Kherson is one of four regions Russia is now attempting to annex from Ukraine. The others are Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine and Donetsk and Luhansk, two eastern Ukrainian regions where fighting against Russian-backed breakaway republics has raged since 2014.",14,2.9666655745274357,1.4713987238145916,1.4952668507128442,8

The announcement by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin came shortly after the head of the Moscow-backed administration in Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, appealed to the Kremlin for help moving residents out of harm's way, in the latest indication that Russian forces were struggling in the face of Ukrainian advances. The Ukrainian military has been carrying out a counteroffensive in Kherson and eastern parts of the country, taking back territory that had been occupied by Russia as well as striking critical infrastructure such as bridges and railways. Saldo claimed cities throughout Kherson, one of four Ukrainian regions Russia claimed to have annexed in violation of international law, were being hammered by dangerous airstrikes. Saldo said local Russian leadership had ""decided to organize the possibility of Kherson families traveling to other regions of the Russian Federation."" ""We suggested that all residents of the Kherson region, if there is such a wish, to protect themselves from the consequences of missile strikes, should go to other regions ... to take their children and leave."" Fighting in Kherson has intensified in recent weeks, as Kyiv pushes ahead with its goal to take back parts of the region Russia seized in the early days of the invasion. US and Ukrainian officials said last month that they hoped to retake all of Kherson by the end of the year. As of last week, Ukraine said it had recaptured 2,400 square kilometers (927 square miles) in Kherson previously under Russian control. Authorities in Kyiv said Wednesday that it had liberated five more small, rural villages as the Ukrainian military pushes further southwest. With Ukrainian forces barreling forward, Saldo appealed to Russian leaders to help local Russian-backed officials move civilians. ""We, residents of the Kherson region, of course, know that Russia does not abandon its own people,"" Saldo said. However, Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Kherson region's military administration, said that the civilian transports were not an ""evacuation."" ""There is no evacuation in the Kherson region and there cannot be any,"" he said. Stremousov has been openly critical of the war's decision-makers in Moscow and on the battlefield. Last week, he blamed the military setbacks in Kherson on ""incompetent commanders"" who have not been held accountable for their mistakes. On Thursday, Stremousov insisted that Saldo was only requesting that authorities ""help organize the departure of residents of the Kherson region for temporary stay and rest in other regions of the Russian Federation."" ""We urge the residents of the Kherson region to remain calm and to not panic. Nobody is going to withdraw Russian troops from the Kherson region,"" Stremousov said. ""This is not an evacuation, this is an opportunity to save lives.""",14,0.7591846167781567,2.3162590154787304,-1.5570743987005735,8
2022-10-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/europe/ukraine-russia-war-next-stages-intl/index.html,Russia is bruised as winter approaches. Can Ukraine land another blow?,"The relative calm in Ukrainian cities far from the country's battlefields was shattered by two painfully familiar sounds this week: the ominous ring of the air raid sirens, and the eruptions of Russian attacks. A wave of missiles, rockets and drones has struck dozens of locations across Ukraine since Monday, according to officials, targeting civilian infrastructure in several major cities, including Kyiv, located hundreds of miles from the front lines in the east and south. The wide bombardment echoed the early days of Russia's scattershot initial invasion in February, but also underlined that the conflict in Ukraine, which for months appeared to be descending into a slow and painful grind in the Donbas, has erupted once again as winter nears. Not for the first time, the war is teetering towards an unpredictable new phase. ""This is now the third, fourth, possibly fifth different war that we've been observing,"" said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia Programme. The strikes followed weeks of Ukrainian ground gains and began two days after a huge explosion damaged the Kerch bridge, the only crossing between the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russia. That blast, which was used by the Kremlin as a justification for Monday's onslaught, bruised the Russian psyche and handed Ukraine a significant strategic boost. With the cold months nearing and likely bringing a slowdown in ground combat, experts say the next weeks of the war are now expected to be vital, and another potential spike in intensity looms over Ukraine as each side seeks to strike another blow. ""What seemed a distant prospect for anything that could be convincingly described as a Ukraine victory is now very much more plausible,"" Giles said. ""The response from Russia is likely to escalate further."" 'Playing for the whistle' Monday's attacks, and further strikes throughout the week, were evidence of Russian President Vladimir Putin lashing out after a series of setbacks in the war that have put him under pressure domestically. And the airborne strikes distract from what has been a dismal stretch for Russia in the ground war. Oleksii Hromov, a senior Ukrainian military official, said last week that Kyiv's forces have recaptured some 120 settlements since late September as they advance in the Kharkiv, Donetsk and Kherson regions. On Wednesday, Ukraine said it had liberated more five settlements in its slow but steady push in Kherson. Russia said Thursday its forces would help evacuate residents of occupied Kherson to other areas, as Ukraine's offensive continued to make gains in the region. The announcement came shortly after the head of the Moscow-backed administration in Kherson appealed to the Kremlin for help moving residents out of harm's way, in the latest indication that Russian forces were struggling in the face of Ukrainian advances. These counter-offensives have shifted the momentum of the war and disproved a suggestion, built up in the West and in Russia during the summer, that while Ukraine could stoutly defend territory, it lacked the ability to seize ground. ""The Russians are playing for the whistle -- (hoping to) avoid a collapse in their frontline before the winter sets in,"" Samir Puri, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the author of ""Russia's Road to War with Ukraine,"" told CNN. ""If they can get to Christmas with the frontline looking roughly as it is, that's a huge success for the Russians given how botched this has been since February."" Faced with growing setbacks, the Kremlin appointed a new overall commander of Russia's invasion. But there is little sign that Gen. Sergey Surovikin can lead his forces back onto the front foot before the end of the year, given the pace and cost of the Ukrainian counter-offensives. Ukrainian troops are focused primarily on pushing Russian forces eastwards, having crossed the Oskil River in late September, with Moscow likely preparing to defend the cities of Starobilsk and Svatove in the Luhansk region, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Landing a major blow in Donbas would send another powerful signal, and Ukraine will be eager to improve on its gains before temperatures plummet on the battlefield, and the full impact of rising energy prices is felt around Europe. ""There are so many reasons why there is an incentive for Ukraine to get things done quickly,"" Giles said. ""The winter energy crisis in Europe, and energy infrastructure and power being destroyed in Ukraine itself, is always going to be a test of resilience for Ukraine and its Western backers."" NATO leaders have vowed to stand behind Ukraine regardless of how long the war takes, but several European countries -- particularly those that relied heavily on Russian energy -- are staring down a crippling cost-of-living crisis which, without signs of Ukrainian progress on the battlefield, could endanger public support. Recent days have meanwhile shown that sites beyond the current theater of ground fighting are far from immune to attacks. It remains unclear exactly how the Kerch bridge bombing was carried out -- and Kyiv has not claimed responsibility -- but the fact that a target so deep in Russian-held territory could be successfully hit hinted at a serious Ukrainian threat towards key Russian assets. Russia scrambles for manpower Russia is struggling on the ground and has failed to achieve supremacy in the air, but Monday's attacks may have achieved one goal -- sending a signal of strength towards the growing list of Putin's internal critics. The assault damaged civilian infrastructure in cities all across Ukraine, killing multiple people and knocking out power in pockets of the country. They were ""an indication of the nature of the threat from Russia,"" Giles said. ""For many months now, the Russian objective has been to destroy Ukraine rather than possess it."" Ukraine's national electricity company, Ukrenergo, says it has stabilized the power supply to Kyiv and central regions of Ukraine after much of the country's electricity supply was disrupted by Russian missile attacks on Monday and Tuesday. But Ukrainian Prime Minister has warned that ""there is a lot of work to do"" to fix damaged equipment, and asked Ukrainians to reduce their energy usage during peak hours. Experts believe it remains unlikely that Russia's aerial bombardment will form a recurrent pattern; while estimating the military reserves of either army is a murky endeavor, Western assessments suggest Moscow may not have the capacity to keep it up. ""We know -- and Russian commanders on the ground know -- that their supplies and munitions are running out,"" Jeremy Fleming, a UK's spy chief, said in a rare speech on Tuesday. That conclusion was also reached by the ISW, which said in its daily update on the conflict Monday that the strikes ""wasted some of Russia's dwindling precision weapons against civilian targets, as opposed to militarily significant targets."" ""Russia's use of its limited supply of precision weapons in this role may deprive Putin of options to disrupt ongoing Ukrainian counter-offensives,"" the ISW assessed. Exactly how much weaponry and manpower each side has left in reserve will be crucial to determining how the momentum will shift in the coming weeks. Ukraine said it intercepted 18 cruise missiles on Tuesday and dozens more on Monday, but it is urging its Western allies for more equipment to repel any future attacks. ""The barrage of missile strikes is going to be an occasional feature reserved for shows of extreme outrage, because the Russians don't have the stocks of precision munitions to maintain that kind of high-tempo missile assault into the future,"" Puri said. Some help for Putin may be on the way, however. An announcement by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that Belarus and Russia will ""deploy a joint regional group of troops"" raised fears of deepened military cooperation between the close allies and that Belarusian troops could formally join Russia in its invasion. Belarus has been complaining of alleged Ukrainian threats to its security in recent days, which observers say could be a prelude to some level of involvement. The impact of such an intervention in terms of pure manpower would be limited; Belarus has around 45,000 active duty troops, which would not significantly bolster Russia's reserves. But it would threaten another assault on Ukraine's northern flank below the Belarusian border. ""The reopening of a northern front would be another new challenge for Ukraine,"" Giles said. It would provide Russia a new route into the Kharkiv oblast (region), which has been recaptured by Ukraine, should Putin prioritize an effort to reclaim that territory, he said. Any further Belarusian involvement in the war could also have a psychological impact, Puri suggested. ""Everyone's mind in Ukraine and in the West has been oriented towards fighting one army,"" he said. Inside Russia, Belarus joining the invasion ""would play into Putin's narrative that this war is about reuniting the lands of ancient Rus states."" A plea to the West By flipping the narrative of the conflict over the past two months, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has achieved one of his own key objectives: showing Ukraine's Western allies that their military aid can help Kyiv win the war. Now Zelensky will hope for more supplies in the short-term as he seeks to drive home those gains. The leader has sought to highlight Ukraine's success in intercepting Russian missiles, saying more than half of the missiles and drones launched at Ukraine in a second wave of strikes on Tuesday were brought down. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that Ukraine needed ""more"" systems to better halt missile attacks, ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. ""These air defense systems are making a difference because many of the incoming missiles [this week] were actually shot down by the Ukrainian air defense systems provided by NATO Allies,"" he said. ""But of course, as long as not all of them are shot down, of course there is a need for more,"" Stoltenberg added. Justin Bronk, a military expert with the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), agreed with that assessment, telling CNN that, ""Ukrainian interception success rates against Russian cruise missiles have risen significantly since the start of the invasion in February."" Ukraine ""badly needed"" modern systems such as the IRIS-T that arrived this week from Germany and the NASAMS expected from the United States, Bronk said. Beyond weapons supplies, Ukraine will be watching to ensure that Western resolve stays firm if Russia tightens energy supplies even further. ""There are many things Russia can do to make the war personal, not just for people of Ukraine but around Europe, to try to force pressure on governments",14,3.0831078975125847,4.50005171789322,-1.4169438203806348,21
2022-10-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/europe/russia-ukraine-crimea-bridge-arrests-intl/index.html,Russian authorities arrest eight people following Crimea bridge blast,"Eight people have been detained over Saturday's blast that damaged the only bridge connecting annexed Crimea with Russia, marking a critical juncture in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed the main intelligence department of the Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, its head Kyrylo Budanov, and its employees and agents organized the ""terrorist attack"" on the Kerch Strait road-and-rail bridge, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported Wednesday. ""At the moment, five citizens of Russia, three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia, who participated in the preparation of the crime, have been detained as part of a criminal case,"" the report by FSB and the Russian Investigative Committee said, according to RIA Novosti. ""The explosive device was concealed in rolls with polyethylene construction film on 22 pallets with a total weight of 22,770 kilograms,"" the FSB report added, RIA Novosti also reported. Ukraine has yet to publicly comment on the new claims by Russia's FSB and Investigative Committee. The Crimea bridge explosion over the weekend served as a major blow to what the Kremlin calls its ""special military campaign"" in Ukraine, as Moscow counters low morale among Russian troops and thinning military supplies. The bridge is strategically important because it links Russia's Krasnador region with the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move roundly criticized by the international community. It is a critical artery for supplying Crimea with both its daily needs and supplies for the military. Over the last few months, dozens of Russian military convoys have used the bridge, carrying vehicles, armor and fuel. Limited car and rail traffic has restarted on the bridge following the blast. However, larger vehicles like heavy trucks, vans and buses are traveling by ferry. Russian officials had earlier claimed the explosion was caused by a truck blowing up on the road bridge. The report said the explosive device had been sent from the port of Odesa in early August this year through Bulgaria, Georgia and Armenia, Russian state media TASS reported. The blast also sparked a feverish response from the Kremlin, which used the explosion to justify a wave of brutal airstrikes across Ukraine Monday in scenes that echoed the early days of the invasion. At least 19 people were killed and more than 100 injured during the attacks, which targeted critical energy infrastructure across Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities, according to Ukrainian officials. Further east, rescuers searched through rubble in the city of Zaporizhzhia Sunday after Russian missile strikes killed at least 13 people and wounded 89 others. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the fatal shelling as an act of ""revenge"" from Russian President Vladimir Putin following recent defeats on the battlefield. ""When his army cannot beat Ukrainian army, he chose to terrorize civilians in response as revenge,"" Kuleba told CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour. International leaders also pledged their support for Ukraine in the wake of the strikes. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, tweeted Monday: ""Such acts have no place in (the) 21st century."" Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo tweeted that the ""bombardment of Kyiv and of civilian targets in many other cities is a reprehensible act by Russia."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky invoked G7 leaders Tuesday to help his country establish an ""air shield"" against aerial attacks. He also called for stiffer sanctions against Russia and reiterated his demand for Russia to be declared a terrorist state. Zelensky's plea came a day after Putin threatened further ""harsh"" responses that correspond ""to the level of threat to the Russian Federation, have no doubt about it,"" while accusing Kyiv of ""terrorism.""

Zelensky's plea comes amid one of the fiercest bombing campaigns that Russia has waged against Ukraine since invading in late February. At least 19 people have been killed and more than 100 wounded across the country, as far away as the western city of Lviv, hundreds of miles from the war's main theaters in eastern and southern Ukraine. Russia has carried out over 30 missile strikes so far on Tuesday, compared to 84 on Monday. Roughly half of those on Tuesday were neutralized by air defenses, according to Ukraine's military. It is unclear how much longer the Russian military may be able to sustain such attacks. But Zelensky said his country needs more help with missile defense systems to combat Moscow's blitz. ""When Ukraine receives a sufficient number of modern and effective air defense systems, the key element of Russian terror -- missile strikes -- will cease to work,"" the Ukrainian President told leaders of the G7 nations Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Zelensky also reiterated his demand for Russia to be declared a terrorist state and further sanctions. ""We must block its energy sector with sanctions, break the stability of Russian revenues from oil and gas trade. A tough price cap is needed for the exports of oil and gas from Russia -- zero profit for the terrorist state,"" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday the intensified barrage of cruise missile and drone strikes are a response to what the Kremlin has called a terrorist attack on the Kerch Bridge, which connects the Russian mainland to the annexed Crimean Peninsula. The bridge, an important artery for both civilian and military traffic, was damaged in a huge explosion early Saturday. What exactly caused the blast remains unclear; Ukraine has not acknowledged responsibility for the incident, and some officials in Kyiv, including Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, allege that the Russian campaign this week was planned before the bridge blast. According to Russia, Tuesday's strikes targeted Ukrainian military sites and power stations -- the latter of which Kuleba described as a war crime ""aimed at creating unbearable conditions for civilians."" Two ""energy facilities"" in Lviv were among those struck. Russia's military escalation this week has been met with widespread outrage, especially among Western democracies. Following its virtual meeting Tuesday, the leaders of the G7 condemned Russia's recent moves to annex Ukrainian territory and its recent ""escalatory steps."" Experts have cautioned that Putin's recent maneuvers -- including annexations of occupied territory, this week's bombing campaign and allusions to nuclear weapons -- are signs of weakness from the Kremlin. The head of the UK's largest spy agency, Jeremy Fleming, said there is ""desperation at many levels inside Russian society and inside the Russian military machine,"" while NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said ""Ukraine has the momentum"" in the conflict. ""Russia is increasingly resorting to horrific and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and critical infrastructure.

2022-10-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/europe/russia-ukraine-strikes-crimea-bridge-analysis-cmd-intl/index.html,The Crimea attack triggered a wave of strikes on Ukraine. But mystery swirls over who blew up Putin's bridge,"The huge explosion on the Crimea bridge shortly before dawn on Saturday severely curtailed road and rail traffic along an important artery -- both civilian and military -- at a critical moment in Russia's campaign in Ukraine. At first sight, it was another embarrassment -- even humiliation -- for the Russian state, still reeling from battlefield setbacks in Kharkiv, Donetsk and, more recently, in Kherson in the south. But by Monday the bridge attack had also become the Kremlin's justification for a sudden blitz of missile attacks across Ukraine. By midday, according to Ukrainian authorities, some 80 missiles and rockets had been fired at infrastructure in a dozen cities -- and Russian officials were promising more to come. In the hours after the bridge explosion, Russian investigators fastened onto one explanation for the blast: It was a terrorist attack using a massive explosive charge hidden in a truck and then detonated as the vehicle crossed the bridge toward Crimea. Russian President Vladimir Putin picked up the theme on Monday, saying Kyiv had ""put itself on a par with the most odious terrorist groups,"" which had prompted the subsequent ""massive strike with precision-guided weapons on Ukrainian infrastructure -- energy infrastructure, military command and communications."" ""It is simply impossible to leave the crimes of the Kyiv regime unanswered,"" he said. Putin went on: ""In terms of the further act of terrorism on the territory of Russia, the Russian reply will be harsh and will be corresponding to the level of threat to the Russian Federation, have no doubt about it."" A flurry of theories The explosion, Moscow's version of what happened and the absence of any Ukrainian acknowledgement for carrying it out, has set off a firestorm of theorizing about what caused it and who was responsible. The Kerch bridge is about 150 miles from the nearest Ukrainian positions, and well beyond the range of weapons provided by the West. But Ukrainian drones were reported to have approached the area in the summer, setting off air defense measures. Some analysts unconvinced by the truck bomb narrative suggested a missile or missiles fired by drones may have been responsible, or that an underwater sabotage team had fixed charges to the bridge's support structure. Images and video from the scene were inconclusive. As the truck identified by the Russians crosses the bridge and begins to ascend to its highest point, it is engulfed in a massive explosion. The Russian Investigative Committee, charged with finding out what caused the explosion, quickly identified the vehicle. Surveillance video emerged of the truck, with its distinct scarlet cab, at a checkpoint before it enters the bridge. It receives a cursory inspection; the driver -- in a short-sleeve shirt -- is seen briefly closing the truck's rear doors. But it's unclear how a truck bomb would have caused two separate spans of the westbound lanes to collapse into the Kerch Strait. Additionally, the force of such a blast would have mostly gone upwards and outwards. Some analysts note that the way the spans collapsed imply the force of the blast came from below. Chris Cobb-Smith, an analyst with the research group Forensic Architecture, is skeptical about the truck narrative. ""It's possible to blow a bridge by using explosives on the span but it takes a huge amount and needs 'tamping' -- a huge weight of ballast on the charge to ensure the blast goes downwards,"" he told CNN. ""I don't believe a truck bomb could have caused this level of damage. This would have entailed a suicide bomber driver, unheard of in the context of this conflict."" Cobb-Smith, a British army veteran, is also skeptical of a special forces operation. ""There are accurate weapon systems that could achieve the aim of destroying the bridge without risking individuals."" But he cautions: ""To solve this I believe we need analysis of the bits of the bridge currently underwater. I still think this would have been easily achieved by a precision munition."" On Sunday, the head of Russia's Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, doubled down on the truck explanation. Face-to-face with Putin in a well-choreographed exchange, Bastrykin said the truck had been in Bulgaria before traveling through Georgia, Armenia, North Ossetia and into Russia. (It would have also had to cross Turkey.) ""It was possible to identify suspects from among those who could prepare a terrorist attack, and people who operate on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Bastrykin said, referring to ""citizens of foreign countries who helped prepare for this terrorist attack."" The investigators reached an ""unequivocal conclusion -- this is a terrorist attack that was being prepared by the Ukrainian special services,"" Bastrykin said. A stern-faced Putin responded: ""I see."" Notably, the president went on to say: ""There is no doubt that this is a terrorist attack aimed at destroying the critical civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation,"" carried out by the special services of Ukraine. On one level, the ""act of terror"" narrative would at least excuse the Russian military from having to explain why its multi-layered defenses around the bridge failed, despite Ukraine's public assertions that it was a legitimate target. On another, it provides -- through Moscow's prism -- the justification for the massive escalation of attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainian intelligence claims those attacks were planned days before the Kerch explosion. Its defense intelligence agency said Monday that Russian military units had ""received instructions from the Kremlin to prepare massive missile strikes on the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine on October 2 and 3."" An obvious target If it wasn't the truck, what might have caused such an explosion? Cobb-Smith says a surface vessel of any sort should and would have been detected. Some analysts have suggested that the explosion could have come from beneath the bridge; others think satellite images indicate the impact was from above and came from the north. Ultimately, according to Cobb-Smith and other experts, there is insufficient video evidence to confirm what happened at Kerch. There is no doubt that the Ukrainians have seen Kerch as a legitimate, even necessary, target. Back in June Dmytro Marchenko, a Ukrainian Maj. Gen. Major General in the south of the country, said the Kerch bridge was the ""number one target."" Marchenko told Radio Liberty: ""This is no secret to their military or our military. Neither for their civilians nor for our civilians. This will be the number one target to hit. It's as if the main gut tightening reserves just have to be cut off. As soon as this intestine is cut off, they will begin to panic."" But Ukrainian officials have been tight-lipped about Saturday's explosion, welcoming the crippling of the bridge (somewhat prematurely given that limited road and rail traffic resumed within 24 hours) without acknowledging involvement. They took the same approach with the sinking of the Russian battleship Moskva. It was weeks before any official acknowledgement emerged. Some Ukrainian officials put the Kerch explosion down to an internal power struggle between Russia's Security Service and Defense Ministry, without offering any evidence. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Zelensky's chief of staff, said Saturday that ""the logistics of the detonation, the synchronization with the fuel echelon [the rail wagons carrying fuel], the volume of the destroyed road surface - all this clearly points to the Russian trail."" The cause of the Kerch blast, and its perpetrator, remain open questions. They may do for some time to come. But there is no doubt that the conflict in Ukraine has moved to yet another level, with Russia now embarked on a relentless assault against Ukraine's power and communications networks, and Ukrainian officials swearing revenge for every missile.",3,1.8773629981064264,2.4046028665244155,-0.5272398684179891,14
2022-10-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/europe/ukraine-kyiv-missile-strikes-russia-intl/index.html,"Putin warns of more attacks after deadly Russian strikes rock Kyiv, Lviv and other Ukrainian cities","Multiple explosions rocked Kyiv and several other Ukrainian cities reported blasts and power outages on Monday morning, as Russia lashed out with a massive wave of violent airstrikes that carried echoes of the initial days of its invasion. At least 11 people were killed in the strikes, while 64 were wounded, the Ukrainian emergency services said. Moscow fired at least 84 cruise missiles toward Ukraine on Monday, the Ukrainian military said, 43 of which were neutralized by missile defense systems. Twenty-four Russian attack drones were also used in the salvo, 13 of which were destroyed. The assault appears to be the heaviest bombardment of missile and rocket attacks seen in most of Ukraine since February, targeting power plants, bridges, civilian infrastructure and other locations. It comes two days after an eruption damaged a crucial bridge to Crimea and dealt a strategic blow to the Kremlin. A wounded Vladimir Putin, who has also seen weeks of Russian losses on the battlefield, had been under pressure to respond with force following the explosion, which Putin on Sunday blamed on Kyiv and described as an act of terror. ""It is simply impossible to leave such crimes unanswered,"" Putin said in a brief television appearance on Monday. ""If attempts to carry out terrorist attacks on our territory continue, responses from Russia will be tough and will correspond in scale to the level of threats to the Russian Federation."" At least four explosions were heard in Ukraine's capital during rush hour on Monday morning. A children's playground was among the sites hit by a rocket or missile, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who tweeted images of a smoldering crater in the ground next to the site. In the western city of Lviv, mayor Andriy Sadovyi said an explosion hit ""a critical infrastructure facility."" ""Part of the city is without electricity. A third of the traffic lights do not work,"" Sadovyi said on Telegram, warning civilians to stay inside. Authorities in Sumy, in the northeast of Ukraine, said there were power outages across the region after missile attacks, reporting that ""two missiles hit an infrastructure facility"" in Konotop. Officials in Kharkiv also reported attacks. For several hours on Monday morning Kyiv's subway system was suspended, with underground stations serving as bunkers. But the air raid alert in the city was lifted at midday, as rescue workers sought to pull people from the rubble caused by the strikes. Demys Shmygal, Ukraine's Prime Minister, said Monday that as of 11 a.m. local time, a total of 11 ""crucial infrastructure facilities"" in eight regions had been damaged. As of Monday afternoon, the electricity supply had been cut in Lviv, Poltava, Sumy, and Ternopil, said the Ukrainian State Emergency Services. Electricity was ""partially disrupted"" in the rest of the country. The blasts will be accompanied by concerns that Putin may seek to escalate the conflict in Ukraine, after Moscow's stuttering ground campaign and the damage to the Crimean bridge dealt a major blow to the Russian President. Putin held an operational meeting of his Security Council on Monday, a day after he called the explosions on the Crimea bridge a ""terrorist attack"" and said the organizers and executors were ""Ukrainian special services."" Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the blast on the enormous 19-kilometer (about 12-mile) bridge, which was built after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, an annexation regarded by the West as illegal. The crossing was opened by Putin himself in 2018, and Ukrainian reaction to the explosion has been gleeful and triumphant. The Russian-appointed head of annexed Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said he had ""good news"" Monday, claiming that Russia's approaches to what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine ""have changed."" ""I have been saying from the first day of the special military operation that if such actions to destroy the enemy's infrastructure had been taken every day, we would have finished everything in May and the Kyiv regime would have been defeated,"" he added. Monday's explosions reverberated across central and western Ukraine, far away from the battlefields in the northeast, east and south where a powerful Ukrainian counter-offensive has liberated towns and pushed Russian troops back in recent weeks. Ukraine's defense intelligence agency alleged that Russia had been planning Monday's missile attacks since early last week, before the blast on the bridge. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the strikes showed Putin is ""is desperate because of battlefield defeats and uses missile terror to try to change the pace of war in his favor."" ""They are trying to annihilate us and wipe us off the face of the earth,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram on Monday as the scale of the attacks became clear. ""That's it, in a nutshell. They are trying to slaughter our people who are sleeping in their homes in Zaporizhzhia. They are trying to kill people who are on their way to work in Dnipro and Kyiv."" ""All over Ukraine, the air raid sirens will not abate. Rockets continue to strike. Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded. I ask you: do not leave your shelters. Stay safe and take care of your families. Let's hang in there and be strong,"" Zelensky added. Ukraine's Western allies doubled down on their support for Kyiv following the strikes, with EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell Fontelles tweeting that ""additional military support from the EU is on its way."" US President Joe Biden said Monday's strikes ""once again demonstrate the utter brutality of Mr. Putin's illegal war on the Ukrainian people."" ""These attacks only further reinforce our commitment to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Biden wrote in a statement. ""Alongside our allies and partners, we will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression, hold Putin and Russia accountable for its atrocities and war crimes, and provide the support necessary for Ukrainian forces to defend their country and their freedom."" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the attacks ""another unacceptable escalation of the war and, as always, civilians are paying the highest price."" The G7 group of nations will hold an emergency meeting via video conference on Tuesday, the office of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz confirmed to CNN, and Zelensky said on Twitter that he would address that meeting.",17,1.9540769821522406,1.5208513067487737,0.4332256754034669,10
2022-10-09,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-security-council-intl/index.html,Putin to chair Russia Security Council meeting after humiliating explosion on strategic Crimea bridge,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold an operational meeting of his Security Council on Monday, just two days after a massive explosion on a key strategic bridge linking Crimea and Russia. The meeting itself isn't out of the ordinary -- Putin regularly holds operational meetings with the Security Council, usually on a weekly basis, according to TASS. However, it comes just days after a major humiliation for the Russian President, when an explosion severely damaged parts of the road and rail bridge between annexed Crimea and the Russian Federation early Saturday. And while the agenda has not been made public, the meeting comes at a strategic crossroads for the Kremlin, which must make a series of unenviable choices after Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine has faltered after a month of military setbacks. Some road traffic and train traffic has resumed on the estimated $3.7 billion bridge. On Saturday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said repair works on the bridge would be carried out around the clock, with a damage survey to be completed within a day and divers scheduled to check all the supports of the bridge. The first passenger services resumed travel across the bridge on Saturday, traveling from the Crimean Peninsula to Krasnodar Krai in southern Russia, Russia's Ministry of Transport said in a statement. Car traffic on the bridge has also restarted in two lanes, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Marat Khusnullin said on Sunday. ""Traffic has already been launched along two lanes on the Crimean bridge,"" he wrote in a Telegram post, adding that earlier, one lane was being used for cars traveling in alternate directions, slowing down traffic. Heavy trucks, vans and buses have been traveling by ferry since the blast. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the blast on the enormous 19-kilometer (about 12-mile) bridge, which was built after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, an annexation regarded by the West as illegal."" The crossing was opened by Putin himself in 2018, and Ukrainian reaction to the explosion has been gleeful and triumphant. Putin called the explosions on the Crimean bridge a ""terrorist attack"" and said the organizers and executors were ""Ukrainian special services."" ""Here, as reported, we have no doubts that this is a terrorist attack aimed at the destruction of the critical infrastructure of Russian Federation. And authors, executors, and masterminds are the secret services of Ukraine,"" Putin said during a meeting with Chairman of the Russian Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin on Sunday. A round of Russian missile strikes on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed 13 people early Sunday, including one child, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the Office of the President of Ukraine. At least 89 civilians, including 11 children, were injured, Oleksandr Starukh, head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said Sunday. According to Tymoshenko, the rescue and search operations are still ongoing, they continue to get people out from under the rubble. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday dismissed the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons in retaliation for the explosion on the bridge, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported. Peskov was asked by RIA whether the attack on the bridge could trigger an activation of Russia's nuclear doctrine because it was ""aimed at destroying critical civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation."" ""No. It's a completely wrong formulation of the question,"" Peskov said. Ukraine's military has been making dramatic advances in a counteroffensive -- the Ukrainian military has recaptured 2,400 square kilometers of territory in Kherson region in the south of the country ""since the beginning of the full-scale war,"" a senior Ukrainian official said Friday, and Ukrainian troops are preparing for further advances into Russian-held Luhansk in the east, according to Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk region's Ukrainian military administration. Hayday acknowledged photographs of Ukrainian troops outside the Luhansk village of Stelmakhivka, less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the crucial post of Svatove. But with a sudden and successful Ukrainian offensive comes concerns Putin will escalate Russia's war in Ukraine, with US President Joe Biden expressing fears of the possible use of weapons of mass destruction. ""First time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have a direct threat of the use (of a) nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they are going,"" Biden warned during remarks at a Democratic fundraiser in New York on Friday. He added: ""I don't think there's any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.""",17,1.1934156845361426,1.4077611877597727,-0.2143455032236301,14
2022-10-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/08/europe/crimea-bridge-explainer-russia-ukraine-intl/index.html,A blast hit a key bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Here's what we know,"A huge blast Saturday damaged the only bridge connecting annexed Crimea to the Russian mainland, causing parts of it to collapse. The attack, which disrupted major transport links between mainland Russia and the annexed peninsula, not only struck a blow against Russia's military effort in Ukraine but also represented a psychological blow for Moscow and a major propaganda victory for Kyiv. Russia responded by launching a barrage of missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday. What happened on the bridge? The exact cause of the bridge blast remains unclear. Russian officials said a fuel truck exploded, and two spans of the road crossing in the direction of Crimea collapsed. A subsequent fire engulfed a train of fuel trucks on a separate part of the bridge. Images of the Kerch bridge showed a portion of the roadway of the vehicle and rail bridge had fallen into the waters below it. Flames could be seen burning from rail cars above. Why is it so important to Russia? It holds huge strategic and symbolic importance for Russia, which built the 19-kilometer (about 12-mile) bridge at a cost of around $3.7 billion after Moscow illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. It was the physical expression of Russian President Vladimir Putin's objective to take over Ukraine and bind it to Russia forever. The day it opened, he led a triumphant convoy over the bridge. Ukrainians revile the bridge, Europe's longest, which stands as a reminder of Russian occupation. It is a critical artery for supplying Crimea with both its daily needs and supplies for the military, in addition to fuel and goods for civilians. Over the last few months, dozens of Russian military convoys have used the bridge, carrying vehicles, armor and fuel. If the Russian military's use of the bridge is hampered, its supply lines to forces in southern Ukraine would become more tenuous, especially when combined with Ukrainian advances southward into Kherson region, north of Crimea. How has Russia explained the bridge blast? Russian officials have claimed that the explosion was caused by a truck blowing up on the road bridge. The spokeswoman for the Russian Investigative committee, Svetlana Petrenko, said Saturday that ""a truck was blown up on the automobile part of the Crimean Bridge from the Taman Peninsula [the westbound lanes of the bridge], which led to the ignition of seven fuel tanks of a train travelling toward the Crimean Peninsula. As a result, two car lanes of the bridge partially collapsed."" Crimea raised its terror-threat level to yellow on Saturday across much of the peninsula after the explosion. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called the bridge blast a ""terrorist attack"" and said that the organizers and executors were ""Ukrainian special services."" CNN is unable to verify the Russian explanation for the explosion. What has Ukraine said? Ukrainian officials gloated over the bridge blast but have not claimed responsibility for the attack. The blast took place the day after Putin turned 70, and Ukraine's Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov published video of the bridge in flames alongside a video of Marilyn Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday, Mister President."" Others online compared the bridge attack to Ukraine's April sinking of the Russian Navy's warship the Moskva. In a brief post on its official Twitter account, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense reacted to the explosion, saying: ""The guided missile cruiser Moskva and the Kerch Bridge -- two notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea -- have gone down. What's next in line, Russkies?"" Among the responses, the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine posted on Facebook, ""Air defense of the Russian Federation, are you sleeping?"" alongside a video showing a section of the bridge's road that had been completely destroyed. What is the status of the bridge? Major transport links between mainland Russia and the annexed peninsula of Crimea -- including buses and trains -- were temporarily suspended in the wake of the attack. Russian officials said a limited amount of car traffic had resumed on undamaged sections of the bridge's roadways by Saturday evening and that train services were resuming on the bridge's railways. But larger vehicles like heavy trucks, vans, and buses continue to be transited on ferry boats Sunday, suggesting a more limited service at least in the short-term. What has been Putin's response? On Monday Russia responded by launching what appeared to be the biggest wave of missile and rocket strikes since Moscow's opening salvo of the war. In a televised address on Monday, the Russian president blamed Ukraine for the Kerch bridge attack, describing it as an act of terror, and threatened more strikes if attacks continued against Russia. In retaliation, he said, Russia had carried out a mass strike using long-range weaponry against Ukraine's energy, military and communications infrastructure. ''In terms of the further act of terrorism on the territory of Russia, the Russian reply will be harsh and will be corresponding to the level of threat to the Russian Federation, have no doubt about it,' Putin warned. Multiple cities across Ukraine came under fire on Monday, with Russia appearing to target civilian areas and energy infrastructure. The Ukrainian government told residents to expect possible rolling blackouts and interruptions to water supply. At least five people were killed in the capital Kyiv, where blasts during the morning rush hour sent residents scrambling to bomb shelters underground for the first time in months. In the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, further casualties were reported after a Russian missile strike destroyed an apartment block. And in Dnipro, a central Ukrainian city that has harbored displaced people fleeing the front lines since the war began, a barrage of rockets left people dead and wounded, roiling any relative sense of safety. Regional authorities in Lviv, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv also reported attacks.",17,1.0617163918038361,0.44028826978800445,0.6214281220158318,14

The blast collapsed part of the roadway on the Kerch Strait road-and-rail bridge -- opened by Putin himself in 2018 -- images and video from the scene showed. At least three people were killed in the explosion, Russian officials said, citing preliminary information. The exact cause of the blast at Europe's longest bridge is yet to be confirmed. Russian officials said a truck exploded, causing Crimea-bound sections of the bridge's roadway to fall. A subsequent fire engulfed a train of fuel tanks on a separate, adjacent rail portion of the bridge. Putin ordered a ""government commission"" to examine the Kerch bridge ""emergency"" in Crimea, Russian state media TASS reported. Also on Saturday, the Russian Defense Ministry announced the appointment of a new commander for what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine, according to Russian state media. The new commander, General Sergey Surovikin, first saw service in Afghanistan before commanding a unit in the second Chechen war. He has commanded several motorized rifle divisions and was instrumental in Russia's operations in Syria, and while there, was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation. His appointment is the latest promotion in a military career that began in 1983 but has also led him to be sanctioned this year by the European Union. The long-term effects on the use of the bridge weren't immediately clear. Russian officials said a limited amount of car traffic had resumed on undamaged sections of the bridge's roadways by Saturday evening and that train services were resuming on the bridge's railways. The first passenger train resumed travel across the bridge on Saturday evening, traveling from the Crimean peninsula to Krasnodar Krai in southern Russia, Russia's Ministry of Transport said in a statement late Saturday. ""Double-decker train No. 28 departing from Simferopol [en route] to Moscow passed through the Crimean bridge. It became the first train to pass through the bridge after the emergency. Train No. 28 left the capital of the Republic of Crimea on schedule at 17:10 and has already passed through the bridge,"" the statement reads. But trucks were being asked to take ferries across the strait, state media reported. The damage to the roadway appeared to be severe, with westbound lanes crippled in at least two places. Video and images from the 19-kilometer (11-mile) bridge appeared to show a portion of the roadway had fallen into the water. Crimea raised its terror-threat level to yellow on Saturday across much of the peninsula after the explosion, according to the Russian-appointed head of Crimea, Sergey Aksenov, in a statement on his Telegram channel. Aksenov also said that the ferry service in Crimea will operate free of charge and will be subsidized from the state budget. He added that all local hotels have confirmed free accommodation for tourists who were unable to leave the peninsula on Saturday. The first ferry with passengers left the port in Kerch for the coast of Kuban, a region in southern Russia separated from the Crimean Peninsula by the Kerch Strait. The lights on the bridge are set to be restored over Saturday night so that repairs can be carried out around the clock, according to a statement published on the website of the Russian Cabinet of Ministers, citing Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin. According to the statement, divers will start their work on Sunday morning and check all the supports of the bridge. Once all results are received, a decision will be made to open traffic on the bridge for buses and heavy vehicles. For now, supply trucks and buses cannot use the bridge to travel from Crimea to Russia. Supply trucks and buses will instead travel from Crimea to Russia via ferry service, and not the bridge, Askenov said. An official in Crimea blamed ""Ukrainian vandals"" for the explosion. Some Ukrainian officials gloated over the incident without directly claiming responsibility -- even announcing commemorative stamps will be made. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that ""the reaction of the Kyiv regime to the destruction of civilian infrastructure testifies to its terrorist nature."" The bridge is strategically important because it links Russia's Krasnodar region with the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 in a move condemned by the international community. It is a critical artery for supplying Crimea with both its daily needs and supplies for the military. Over the last few months, dozens of Russian military convoys have used the bridge, carrying vehicles, armor and fuel. If the Russian military's use of the bridge is hampered, its supply lines to forces in southern Ukraine would become more tenuous, especially when combined with Ukrainian advances southward into Kherson region, north of Crimea. Russia has used the Crimean railroads to ferry supplies to forces in Kherson, and several rail hubs in both Crimea and Kherson have been attacked by long-range Ukrainian rockets. Sergey Aksenov, the Russian-appointed Head of Crimea, said ""two spans of the roadbed of the part [of the bridge] from Krasnodar to Kerch, collapsed"" after the explosion, and that a train's fuel tanks caught fire. Preliminary information indicates three people were killed in the incident, ""presumably the passengers of a car that was next to the blown-up truck,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said on Telegram. At least two bodies, that of a man and a woman, were recovered from the water, and their identities were being established, the investigative panel said. Records indicate the truck that exploded belonged to someone in Russia's Krasnodar region; investigators are checking the owner's home and trying to determine the truck's route, the investigative committee said. The bridge spans the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov, on which sit key Ukrainian ports, including Mariupol. For Russia, the bridge symbolizes the physical ""reunification"" of Crimea with the Russian mainland. No further details on the timing or scope of the commission have been announced. RIA Novosti said that there are ""no projections for the timing of the restoration of the Crimean bridge yet,"" citing Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov. An official in Crimea placed blame on ""Ukrainian vandals."" ""Ukrainian vandals somehow managed to get their bloody paws on the Crimean bridge. And now they have something to be proud of, in 23 years of their economic activity, they did not manage to build anything deserving of interest in Crimea. But they did succeed in damaging the roadbed of the Russian bridge,"" Chairman of the State Council of the Republic of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov said. ""Such is the whole essence of the Kiev regime and the Ukrainian state ... Of course, the causes of the accident will be investigated, and the damage will be repaired swiftly,"" he added. CNN cannot independently verify Konstantinov's claim. Ukraine reacts to explosion Ukrainian officials taunted Russia over the explosion without directly acknowledging that Ukraine was responsible for the attack. ""Air defense of the Russian Federation, are you sleeping?"" the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said on Facebook, alongside a video showing a section of the bridge's road that had been completely destroyed. ""Russian illegal construction is starting to collapse and catch fire. The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, sooner or later, it will explode. And this is just the beginning,"" David Arakhamia, the head of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky's party in parliament and a member of Kyiv's negotiating team with Russia, said in a Telegram statement about the incident. A senior Ukrainian official, Oleksiy Danilov, posted video of the damaged Kerch bridge alongside a clip of Marilyn Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday, Mr President,"" which Monroe performed for President John F. Kennedy in 1962. Putin turned 70 on Friday. The Ukrainian Postal Service will issue stamps featuring the damaged bridge, its CEO said Saturday. ""I will not wish you a good day, because it is already wonderful. The Kerch bridge is done,"" the official, Igor Smelyansky, said. On Thursday, Oleksii Hromov, a senior official with the General Staff, said that since September 21, Ukrainian troops had managed to advance 55 kilometers in the north-east, ""establish control over 93 settlements, [and] take control over more than 2,400 square kilometers."" Hromov appeared to be referencing gains in Kharkiv region that were made before September 21 but only confirmed later. In an interview in August, a senior Ukrainian military commander said the Kerch bridge was a legitimate target. ""This is a necessary measure in order to deprive them (Russia) of the opportunity to provide reserves and reinforce their troops from Russian territory,"" Maj. Gen. Dmytro Marchenko said in an interview with RBC-Ukraine. Russia's bridge to Crimea The Kerch bridge is able to handle 40,000 cars a day and to move 14 million passengers and 13 million tons of cargo per year, state news agency RIA Novosti reported when Putin opened the bridge in 2018. Russian special forces masked in camouflage without unit insignia seized Crimea in a lightning operation in February 2014. Initially, Russia denied that its troops had carried out the mission. Later, it acknowledged that the so-called ""little green men"" were indeed Russian units. The West responded swiftly with crippling economic sanctions. Russia constructed the bridge after the annexation, spending an estimated $3.7 billion. The damage done Saturday will be a psychological blow to Moscow -- the bridge was the physical expression of Putin's objective to bind Ukraine to Russia. The day it opened in 2018, he led a triumphant convoy over the bridge, driving a truck festooned with flags. Analysis: What the bridge explosion means for Putin and his war effort After the bridge opened, the United States condemned its construction as illegal. ""Russia's construction of the bridge serves as a reminder of Russia's ongoing willingness to flout international law,"" according to a US State Department statement at the time. ""The bridge represents not only an attempt by Russia to solidify its unlawful seizure and its occupation of Crimea, but also impedes navigation by limiting the size of ships that can transit the Kerch Strait, the only path to reach Ukraine's territorial waters in the Sea of Azov."" Ukrainian officials echoed those sentiments following the explosion. ""Crimea, the bridge, the beginning.

2022-10-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/08/europe/crimea-bridge-putin-ukraine-analysis-intl/index.html,Putin faces more grim choices after blast hits his prized Crimea bridge,"An explosion that severely damaged parts of the road and rail bridge between annexed Crimea and the Russian mainland early Saturday seems designed to play into President Vladimir Putin's current talent for making bad decisions. It brings forward by a number of weeks the strategic choices he must make about Russia's occupation of southern Ukraine. This entire presence was already poorly supplied, managed and in retreat. And it shows that the key railway route into Crimea and onwards to the frontlines in Kherson is highly vulnerable to future attacks. While Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the Kerch Strait bridge blast, it has previously taken credit for a series of strikes on targets in Russian-occupied Crimea over the summer. Russian officials said a limited amount of car traffic had resumed on undamaged sections of the bridge's roadways by Saturday evening and that train services were resuming on the bridge's railways. But trucks were being asked to take ferries across the strait, state media reported. Rickety ferry crossings in bad weather or highly dangerous air cargo flights may now be needed to bolster military shipments into Crimea and towards the frontlines, which will place more pressure on a single railway track further east coming through Melitopol along the Azov Sea coast. It exposes the staggering 20th century weakness of Russia's armed forces and occupation: They need railways to get around. Ukraine has been targeting this system with slow, patient accuracy. First Izium, which led to the collapse around Kharkiv. Then Lyman, which is leading to the erosion of Russia's control of Donetsk and Luhansk. And now the Kerch Bridge, which had become so vital to everything that Russia is trying to hold on to in the south. Compounding the problem for Putin is the fact that Russia's rail hub further inside Donetsk was also hit on Saturday; a look at Ilovaisk on a map shows the railway arteries running through it. A cargo train detonated there this morning, likely having some impact on Russia's ability to feed the railway lines inside Donetsk and Luhansk that Ukraine has already put under great pressure. Ukraine has had patient timing on hitting these pressure points. They have not struck until they have seen a moment of weakness -- until the Russians are experiencing serious issues already -- ensuring that the damage inflicted lasts while time-consuming repairs are underway. (While Russia claims that railway traffic was set to be restored by Saturday night, the bridge's vulnerability to attack at the least will lessen traffic). A challenge to Putin's poker face Putin now faces a series of expedited and painful decisions, all of which will severely belie his continued poker-face of pride and bombast towards the gathering signs of slow defeat. To the west of the Dnipro river, his army in Kherson is besieged by fast-moving Ukrainian forces. They are already in retreat, partially owing to the same poor resupply that will be accentuated by the Kerch blast. They are again cut off from this faltering supply line by another series of damaged or targeted bridges across the Dnipro. Over the past week, they have already fallen back over 500 square kilometers. Can Moscow sustain this force over two damaged supply routes? A precarious presence has perhaps overnight become near-impossible. Does enough truth filter through to the Kremlin head to lead him to pull back? Or does he take the higher stakes gamble of spreading his isolated forces thinly across a wide expanse? The second point of decision relates to Crimea. Putin personally opened the bridge across the Kerch Strait by driving a truck across it in 2018. The illegal annexation of the Ukrainian territory has been the source of misplaced pride and imperial pomp for the Kremlin. But Putin now faces the difficult choice of fortifying it further with depleted forces who face resupply issues, or partially withdrawing his military to ensure their significant resources on the peninsula do not get cut off. There is a sizeable risk of this. The Kerch bridge can be hit again. The railway link across Melitopol is now a target of outsized value. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said just last week that an offensive from Zaporizhzhia towards Melitopol was a possibility. The mere possibility that Russia's last untouched railway path into the south could be disrupted raises existential issues for its occupation. Putin must choose between feeding his larger ambitions with a dwindling chance of success, or consolidating forces around an objective he has a greater chance of achieving. One carries the risk of catastrophic collapse, for his entire brutal adventure into Ukraine, and quite possibly his rule. The second leaves him with an immediate loss of face, but a stronger chance of sustaining the occupation of smaller parts of Ukraine. His internal position has not looked weaker since he came to power in 2000. An admission of failure may be unpalatable at this stage, and a greater gamble the easier move. Yet he again tips the war towards a binary moment where his occupation -- and even regime -- faces a complete collapse or a tiny, madcap prospect of victory. Nuclear threats and rhetoric have been the horrifying backdrop of this war. Yet still Moscow has not resorted to any doomsday moves while NATO armed Ukraine to an extent that was unthinkable before the war. Kyiv's smart and patient strikes on Russia's ageing transport dependencies has left Putin with a series of existential decisions to make in the hours ahead. He's made a lot of bad ones in the past seven months. Does the Kerch explosion add to that list, or provide a cold bath of reality, and a readjustment of the Kremlin's view of the possible.",14,0.9850224769543989,5.034597824535431,-4.049575347581031,14

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president's office said six settlements had been liberated in the Kherson district as well as 61 in the Beryslav district. Tymoshenko said the evacuation of civilians continued amid massive destruction to critical infrastructure in towns like Arkhanhelske, Vysokopillia and Osokorivka, all of which saw weeks of heavy fighting and indirect fire. Demining is in progress, he added. Ukrainian forces have been making steady progress in Kherson since beginning an offensive at the end of last month, and their successes have sparked rare criticism of Moscow's war effort among pro-Russian figures. On Thursday, Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-appointed deputy leader of occupied Kherson, blamed ""gaps"" on the battlefield in the Kherson region on ""incompetent commanders."" ""Indeed, many say that the Minister of Defense [Sergei Shoigu], who allowed this situation to happen, could, as an officer, shoot himself. But, you know, the word officer is an unfamiliar word for many,"" Stremousov said in a video posted on Telegram. Stremousov's comments come as Kyiv is successfully pushing ahead in its campaign to retake parts of southern and eastern Ukraine that Russia captured in the initial weeks of the war. Pro-Russian propagandists and military analysts have blamed the string of losses on what they see as mistakes by the Russian military, but few Russian-installed officials on Ukrainian soil have so publicly skewered Moscow's flailing war effort. Members of Russia's parliament and regional officials have begun to level similar criticisms at the country's military, alleging that insufficient troops were deployed to hold the parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Moscow's forces captured in the initial weeks of the conflict. Col. Gen. Andrei Kartapolov, the head of Russia's State Duma defense committee, said Thursday officials need to ""stop lying"" about developments on the ground. ""People know. Our people are not stupid,"" Kartapolov said in an interview with a Russian journalist. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his forces' counteroffensive in his evening address on Tuesday. ""The Ukrainian army is making a rather fast and powerful advance in the south of our country in the course of the ongoing defensive operation,"" Zelensky said in his evening address. ""Our warriors do not stop. And it is only a matter of time when we will expel the occupier from all our land.""",14,2.3394808148539825,3.1621175108763584,-0.8226366960223759,8
2022-10-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/europe/kharkiv-bodies-intl/index.html,Ukraine police say bodies of more than 500 civilians found in Kharkiv,"The bodies of more than 500 civilians have been discovered in territory in northeast Ukraine recently retaken from Russian forces, Ukrainian police say. And as Ukrainian forces liberate more land in the northeast, new burial sites are being discovered in Donetsk. Many appear to contain the remains of civilians who lost their lives during several months of shelling and rocket fire. ""We found the bodies of 534 civilians from the de-occupied territories"" in Kharkiv region alone, said Serhii Bolnivov, head of the investigative department of the regional police. The bodies included 226 women and 19 children, Bolvinov added. Most of those recovered - 447 - were found at what he described as a ""mass burial site"" in the town of Izium, which Ukrainian forces liberated from Russian occupation in early September. Russian troops had been using Izium as a launchpad for attacks southward into the Donetsk region. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh visited the site in mid-September. Bolvinov also alleged that more than twenty suspected Russian ""torture chambers"" have been found in the region. ""In almost all large cities and towns, where military units of the Russian army were based, they set up such places of detention of civilians and prisoners of war and tortured them,"" he said, mentioning one in the town of Pisky-Radkivski. ""This is the 22nd torture chamber which we have found and inspected in the de-occupied territory of the Kharkiv region,"" said Bolvinov. He said the most common torture techniques were electric shocks and severe beatings with sticks and other objects. There were also cases of nails being pulled out and the use of gas masks to restrict breathing. Bolvinov said there were also criminal proceedings underway regarding allegations of rape. ""We understand that it is very difficult for victims to testify about such facts. However, there are proceedings that we have registered, there are appeals from women who were raped. We have information about the alleged facts of rapes in torture chambers,"" Bolvinov added. The Ukrainian investigations in Kharkiv follow the discovery of grave human rights abuses by Russian forces north of Kyiv in March. Russia was accused of a litany of war crimes during its unsuccessful campaign to capture Kyiv in the early months of the war. After retreating from Bucha, a suburb of the Ukrainian capital, reports of emerged of Russian forces carrying out summary executions indiscriminate shelling. Bodies were found shot, tied up and left to rot, some bearing signs of torture. In nearby Borodianka, dead civilians were found strewn along the streets. Homes were reportedly ransacked. Moscow has consistently denied its soldiers are responsible for war crimes. In Bucha, the Kremlin claimed -- without evidence -- that the atrocities there were staged. However, witnesses who spoke to CNN said the carnage in the town began after its occupation. A report published in July by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe found that found that the patterns of violent acts by Russian forces in Ukraine meet the qualification of crimes against humanity.",13,6.029131273744832,3.200459578754414,2.8286716949904176,19
2022-10-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/europe/wagner-ukraine-struggles-marat-gabidullin-cmd-intl/index.html,Morale is plummeting in Putin's private army as Russia's war in Ukraine falters,"The Ukrainians' bodies lay side-by-side on the grass, the earth beside them splayed open by a crater. Dragged to the spot by Russian mercenaries, the victims' arms pointed to where they had died. ""Let's plant a grenade on them,"" a voice says in husky Russian, in what appears to be a plan to booby-trap the bodies. ""There is no need for a grenade, we will just bash them in,"" another says of the Ukrainian soldiers who will come to collect the bodies. The mercenaries then realize they have run out of ammunition. These events seen and heard on battlefield video, exclusive to CNN, along with access to Wagner recruits fighting in Ukraine, and candid, rare interviews CNN has conducted with a former Wagner commander now seeking asylum in Europe, combine to give an unprecedented look at the state of Russia's premier mercenary force. While problems of supply and morale, as well as allegations of war crimes have been well documented among regular Russian troops, the existence of similar crises among Wagner mercenaries, often described as President Vladimir Putin's off-the-books shock troops, is a dire omen for Russia's war in Ukraine. In the shadow of the Kremlin Wagner forces have for several years enjoyed global notoriety. But as Putin's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine comes apart at the seams, and the announcement of a ""partial mobilization"" for much-needed conscripts has prompted more than 200,000 Russian citizens to flee to neighboring countries, the cracks in this supposedly elite force are showing. Since its creation in 2014, Wagner's mandate, international footprint and reputation have swelled. Widely considered by analysts to be a Kremlin-approved private military company, its fighters have battled in Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2014 and in Syria, as well as operating in several African countries, including Sudan, Libya, Mozambique, Mali and the Central African Republic. With a reputation in Russia as a reliable and valuable force, Wagner private soldiers have bolstered Moscow's global interests and military resources, already stretched fighting a war in Syria in support of the Assad regime. As CNN has reported, their deployments have often been key to Russian control of lucrative resources, from Sudanese gold to Syrian oil. Read CNN's special report on Putin's Private Army. Flaunting modern equipment in recruiting videos, with heavy weapons and even helicopters, they resemble US Special Forces. ""I am convinced that if Russia did not use mercenary groups on such a massive scale, there would be no question of the success that the Russian army has achieved so far,"" Marat Gabidullin -- a former Wagner commander who was once in charge of 95 mercenaries in Syria -- told CNN. In touch with former comrades now fighting in Ukraine, Gabidullin said that Russia's use of mercenaries has ramped up as the Kremlin's execution of its war has fallen into disarray. Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told CNN that Wagner troops were being deployed in the ""most difficult and important missions"" in Ukraine, playing a key role in Russian victories in Mariupol and Kherson. The Kremlin did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Limited official information about Wagner and long-standing Kremlin denials about its existence and ties to the Russian state have only added to its infamy and allure, while helping the group to cloud analysis of its exact capabilities and activities. In reality, though, Wagner -- like Russia -- is struggling in Ukraine, according to the video testimony of the group's own mercenary fighters. Lack of experience More than seven months of fighting have thrown a harsh light on failings in Russia's military performance in Ukraine. Russia's small gains, especially compared to Putin's initial ambitious targets in the war, have come at huge cost, decimating frontline units and starving many of manpower, as well as critically important experience. Battlefield experience is one of two factors ex-Wagner commander Gabidullin -- who left the group in 2019 and has since published a memoir of his time working for them -- says separates mercenaries from regular Russian troops, the other being money. ""The backbone of these groups was always made up of very experienced people who had passed through several wars anyway,"" he told CNN. After serving as a junior officer with an airborne unit in the dying days of the Soviet Union, Gabidullin returned to military life as a Wagner recruit following Russia's 2014 invasion of eastern Ukraine. He said many key Wagner personnel may, like him, have previously fought in Ukraine as well as in Syria, gaining valuable combat experience alien to most regular Russian troops. ""They have more weighty, more meaningful experience than the army. The army are young soldiers who were forced to sign a contract, they have no experience,"" he said. It's what makes such paramilitary forces in Ukraine, of which Wagner is just one, so valuable to Russia. ""The Russian army cannot handle [the war] without mercenaries,"" according to Gabidullin, adding that there's ""a very big myth, a very big obfuscation about a strong Russian army."" Today, at least 5,000 mercenaries tied to the Wagner group are operating with Russian forces in Ukraine, Andrii Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine's defense intelligence agency who has been monitoring Wagner in Ukraine, told CNN. This figure was backed up by a French intelligence source who noted that some Wagner fighters had left the African continent to bolster the group's efforts in Ukraine. The Kremlin has increasingly relied on Wagner fighters as assault troops, according to Ukraine's defense ministry. Hidden from official Russian death counts and available for deniable operations, they've borne a burden of casualties that have been politically sensitive for Putin in Russia. ""Wagner has been suffering high losses in Ukraine, especially and unsurprisingly among young and inexperienced fighters,"" according to a senior US defense source speaking in September. A simple equation underlies the employment of Wagner forces, according to Gabidullin: ""Russian peace for American dollars."" The mercenaries can earn up to $5,000 per month. Wagner fighters have even been offered bonuses -- all paid in US dollars -- for wiping out Ukrainian tanks or units, according to a senior Ukrainian defense source and based on the intelligence gathered on Wagner since the start of the war by Ukrainian authorities. According to the UK's Ministry of Defense, Wagner fighters have also been allocated specific sectors of the front line, operating almost as normal army units, a stark change from their history of distinct, limited missions in Ukraine. Yusov also said that Wagner is increasingly being used to patch holes in the Russian front line. This was also confirmed by a US senior defense official, who added that Wagner is being used across different front lines unlike Chechen fighters, for instance, who are focused around the Russian offensive aimed at Bakhmut. That has led to significant logistical challenges, he says, with the need to supply Wagner troops with ammunition, food and support for extended operations, all while Ukraine has upped its attacks on Russia's logistics. Bodycam footage purportedly from Wagner fighters in August passed to CNN by the Ukrainian defense ministry shows mercenaries complaining of a lack of body armor and helmets. In another video a fighter complains about orders to attack Ukrainian positions when his unit is out of ammunition. Shoes to fill Wagner's ranks have also been depleted by battlefield losses. In response, they've turned to unusually public recruitment. Billboards have sprung up in Russia calling for new recruits to Wagner. Adorned with a phone number and picture of camouflage-clad fighters, their slogan -- ""Orchestra 'W' Awaits You"" -- alludes to Wagner's past nickname as the ""orchestra."" The wide net cast by the group's recruiting efforts matches a shift from its past secrecy. Even Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin finally admitted his role as Wagner chief in late September, having spent years trying to distance himself from the mercenary group through repeated denials, and even taking Russian media outlets investigating him to court. Wagner's invitations to contact recruiters have also spread via social media and online. One recruiter contacted by CNN offered a monthly salary of ""at least 240,000 rubles"" (about $4,000) with the length of a ""business trip"" -- code for a deployment -- of at least four months. Much of the recruiter's message listed medical conditions that excluded applicants from joining: from cancer to hepatitis C and substance abuse. In contrast to its image as a military elite organization, a Wagner recruiter had one startling admission regarding recruits when contacted by a CNN journalist: no military experience necessary. The message finished with a code word -- ""Morgan"" -- that applicants were to give at the gate of the Wagner facility in Krasnodar, Russia. Jailhouse recruits In September, video surfaced appearing to be Prigozhin recruiting prisoners from Russian jails for Wagner His offer: a promise of clemency for six months' combat service in Ukraine, propping up Russia's flailing invasion. It's a move that would have been unthinkable months ago for the private military company once considered one of the most professional units in the Kremlin's arsenal. ""An act of desperation"" is how the ex-Wagner commander Gabidullin described the appeal. Prigozhin's apparent jailhouse recruitment drive matches broader Russian efforts to mobilize the country's prison population for combat, offering monthly salaries worth thousands of dollars and death payments of tens of thousands of dollars to recruits' families. For both Wagner comrades and their Ukrainian adversaries, that's worrying. ""[Wagner] are ready to send anyone, just anyone,"" Ukrainian Prosecutor Yuriy Belousov, told CNN. ""There is no criteria for professionalism anymore."" Working on Ukrainian investigations into possible Russian war crimes, Belousov fears that this lax recruiting will see the scale of war crimes increase. Although direct recruitment from prisons is a new step, Gabidullin said that a criminal record hadn't been an obstacle to employment with Wagner. He himself says he had served three years in prison for murder and told CNN of prominent Wagner commanders who had served around the world with the group after prison sentences. The enemy within Wagner's struggles in Ukraine have set in motion a wider problem: discontent in its ranks. For a group that depends on the appeal of its salaries and work, that's critical. From intercepted phone calls, Ukrainian intelligence services in August noted a ""general decline in morale and the psychological state"" of Wagner troops",14,3.9173051856589165,3.9262577626680653,-0.008952577009148754,6

Pro-Russian propagandists and military analysts have blamed the string of losses on what they see as mistakes by the Russian military, but few Russian-installed officials on Ukrainian soil have so publicly skewered Moscow's flailing war effort. Stremousov alleged that a ""small number"" of what he called ""corrupt marauders and other miscellaneous riffraff"" were responsible for ""gaps"" on the battlefield. He singled out Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, saying he ""allowed this situation to happen.""

The leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, criticized Russia's withdrawal on Saturday from the strategic eastern city of Lyman in the region of Donetsk. Kadyrov, a key ally of President Vladimir Putin, said Russian troops ""were not provided with the necessary communication, interaction and the supply of ammunition."" Kherson and Donetsk are two of the four regions Russia is planning to annex in violation of international law. Donetsk and Luhansk are both in eastern Ukraine, and fighting against Moscow-backed breakaway republics in each region has been raging since 2014. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are in southern Ukraine and have been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began in late February. Ukraine's military has made significant gains in Kherson in the past week, liberating more than 400 square kilometers (155 square miles) in an unspecified time frame, a Ukrainian military spokeswoman said. Stremousov denied this. He said Russian troops were ""holding back the onslaught"" and Ukraine's advances ""had been stopped."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the communities of Novovoskrensenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka had been liberated, suggesting that Ukrainian forces are making progress through the region's largely rural hinterland.

The mission, called Crew-5, is a joint operation by NASA, SpaceX and their government partners around the world, including — for the first time — Russia, despite mounting tensions on the ground surrounding the invasion of Ukraine. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The Crew Dragon capsule spent a day making a slow, methodical climb toward the space station. And as it approached the ISS, the spacecraft, which is fully autonomous, used its small onboard thrusters to stay oriented as it eased into its docking port. It first made physical contact with the ISS at 5:01 p.m. ET. After ensuring a vacuum-tight seal between the SpaceX spacecraft and the ISS, the hatch that separated the capsule and the space station was opened, officially joining the spacecraft. As is routine for astronauts arriving at the ISS, the crew was able to send a video message to the ground that was aired on NASA's livestream. The crew members include astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada of NASA; astronaut Koichi Wakata of JAXA, or Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; and cosmonaut Anna Kikina of Russia's Roscosmos space agency. Samantha Cristoforetti, a European Space Agency astronaut who flew on a previous SpaceX mission to the ISS and recently became the first female commander of the space station, welcomed them. ""It's just fantastic to finally have you guys on board. And this is a very special crew because it's the first time that we have a Russian cosmonaut flying on a Crew Dragon, so very special welcome to Anna (Kikina),"" Cristoforetti said. The spaceflight marks a historic moment, as Mann has become the first Native American woman ever to travel to space. ""Look, Mom, I'm finally in space!"" she said on the livestream dispatch from the ISS. Mann is also serving as Crew-5 mission commander, making her the first woman ever to take on such a role for a SpaceX mission. Kikina, who is also experiencing her first-ever spaceflight, shared in the celebratory moment. ""We overflow with emotions,"" Kikina added. A Russian translator took over shortly after from her dispatch, relaying, ""I'm extremely happy that I am here."" Kikina then added through the translator: ""A lot of people are working hard and will keep working hard to make sure ... that our common (crewed) space exploration will continue to exist to develop further. We're here and we're living proof of it,"" she said. Kikina's participation in this flight is part of a ride-sharing agreement inked by NASA and Roscosmos in July. Despite geopolitical tensions between the United States and Russia reaching a near fever pitch as the war in Ukraine has escalated, NASA has repeatedly said that its partnership with Roscosmos on the ISS is vital to continuing the space station's operations and the valuable scientific research that is carried out on board. During a news conference on Wednesday, Sergei Krikalev, the executive director of Human Space Flight Programs at Roscosmos, also had commented on the significance of the US-Russian partnership. ""We just continue what was started many years ago, in 1975 when the Apollo-Soyuz crew worked together,"" Krikalev said, referring to an in-space meetup in 1975 that became a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation between the US and Russia. ""Now we continue that."" The Crew-5 astronauts will spend about five months in space. During their stay, they're expected to conduct spacewalks to maintain the space station's exterior, as well as perform more than 200 science experiments. ""Experiments will include studies on printing human organs in space, understanding fuel systems operating on the Moon, and better understanding heart disease,"" according to a NASA statement. This is the sixth crewed mission that SpaceX, a privately owned company headed by controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk, has carried out on NASA's behalf. The program stems from a $2.6 billion deal that NASA and SpaceX signed nearly a decade ago as part of the space agency's efforts to hand over all transportation to and from the ISS to the private sector so that NASA could focus on exploring deeper into the solar system. Aerospace giant Boeing also signed a similar contract, though it's still working to get its commercial spacecraft, the Starliner, up and running. Its first crewed flight could happen in early 2023. Meanwhile, NASA has continued to extend its partnership with SpaceX, growing the value of their overall deal to encompass 15 total crewed missions at a value of more than $4.9 billion.",3,8.57036138429191,8.349980072254546,0.22038131203736455,11

The US was not aware of the plan beforehand, according to the sources, and it is still unclear who exactly the US believes signed off on the assassination. It is also not clear whether the US intelligence community believes that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was aware of the plot or authorized it. But the intelligence finding, first reported by the New York Times, would seem to corroborate elements of the Russian authorities' findings that the car bombing was ""pre-planned."" Russia had accused Ukrainian nationals of being responsible for the attack, which Ukraine had strongly denied in the aftermath of the explosion. Asked to comment, a Ukrainian defense intelligence official told CNN Wednesday evening following publication of the latest reports that their agency had no new information on Dugina's death. Shortly after her death, the same official had told CNN that Ukraine had nothing to do with it. The National Security Council, CIA and State Department declined to comment. US intelligence officials believe that Dugina was driving her father's car on the night she was killed, and that her father was the actual target of the operation, one of the sources said. Dugin is a Russian ultranationalist and philosopher who has been a fierce proponent of Russia's war in Ukraine. A friend of Dugina also told the Russian state owned news outlet TASS shortly after the explosion that the car she was driving was her father's. Just days after Dugina's death, Russian authorities accused a Ukrainian woman of remotely detonating explosives planted in Dugina's Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, and then driving through the Pskov region and into Estonia to escape. Oleksii Danylov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security Council, immediately denied the allegation. ""We have nothing to do with the murder of this lady -- this is the work of the Russian special services,"" he said in August. Zelensky adviser Mykhailo Podolyak also said at the time that the Russian accusation reflected the ""fictional world"" the Russian government is operating in. The intelligence surrounding Ukraine's involvement, if accurate, would signal a bold expansion of Ukraine's covert operations to target a well-known political figure just outside of Moscow. To date, Ukrainian strikes inside Russia have largely been limited to attacks on fuel depots and military bases in cities along the Russia-Ukraine border, like Belgorod. But the US does not have good visibility into all of Ukraine's planned strikes, sources told CNN. A Ukrainian official told CNN that the US intelligence community's findings had not been broached during a meeting between US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak in Istanbul earlier this week. It is not clear whether the issue was raised more recently by President Joe Biden in a phone call with Zelensky on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the National Security Council declined to comment. Dugina, who was 29 when she was killed, was a public figure in her own right and frequently appeared as a commentator on Russian TV networks pushing anti-West, nationalist narratives. As CNN has previously reported, Dugina also ran an English- and Turkish-language website called United World International, which itself was part of a broader propaganda effort known as ""Project Lakhta."" The State Department has accused Project Lakhta of deploying online ""trolls"" to interfere in US elections. The US sanctioned both Dugin and Dugina after Russia's invasion in February, accusing them of spreading propaganda and acting to destabilize Ukraine.

The mission, which includes some historic firsts, moved forward even as rising geopolitical tensions brew on the ground. The four crew members — astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada of NASA, astronaut Koichi Wakata of JAXA, or Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and cosmonaut Anna Kikina of Roscosmos — took off aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft at 12 p.m. ET from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After reaching orbit, NASA shared footage of the crew aboard their capsule, sharing their excitement as they explained that they brought along a ""freefall indicator"" — a small, stuffed doll in the likeness of Albert Einstein. The toy was left to float around the cabin, signaling that the crew had entered weightlessness. Einstein, who first conceptualized the Theory of Relativity, had the ""happiest thought of his entire life"" when he realized that a ""person in freefall can feel their own weight,"" Cassada explained in a dispatch from the Crew Dragon spacecraft. ""We live in the same world, we live in the same universe. Sometimes we experience it in a very different way from our neighbors. We can all keep that in mind ... and continue to do amazing things,"" Cassada said, and Kikina could be seen pumping her fist as he spoke. ""And do it together."" Dubbed Crew-5, the mission is the sixth astronaut flight launched as a joint endeavor between NASA and SpaceX, a privately held aerospace company, to the space station. The spaceflight marks a historic moment, as Mann not only became the first Native American woman ever to travel to space. She's also serving as mission commander, making her the first woman ever to take on such a role for a SpaceX mission. What's more, Kikina is the first Russian to join a SpaceX mission as part of a ride-sharing deal NASA and Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, inked in July. Her participation in the flight is the latest clear signal that, despite mounting tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the decades-long US-Russia partnership in space will persist — at least for now. The Crew Dragon spacecraft is now on a slow, precise trek to the ISS, which orbits about 200 miles (322 kilometers) above the Earth's surface. The spacecraft is aiming to dock with the space station on Thursday around 5 p.m. ET. What's notable about this flight? Launching NASA astronauts to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft is nothing new. The space agency collaborated with SpaceX for years to transition the task of shuttling people to and from the space station after NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011. With the return of astronaut launches from US soil, SpaceX has offered a stage for several historic firsts. The Crew-4 Dragon mission, for example, carried NASA astronaut Jessica Watkins, the first Black woman ever to join the ISS crew. On this flight, Mann, a registered member of the Wailacki tribe of the Round Valley Reservation, became the first Native American woman ever to travel to orbit. ""I am very proud to represent Native Americans and my heritage,"" Mann told reporters before launch. ""I think it's important to celebrate our diversity and also realize how important it is when we collaborate and unite, the incredible accomplishments that we can have."" In her role as commander, Mann will be responsible for ensuring the spacecraft is on track from the time it launches until it docks with the ISS and again when it returns home with the four Crew-5 astronauts next year. Never before has a woman taken on the commander role on a SpaceX mission, though a couple of women served in that position during the Space Shuttle Program. Kikina, the Roscosmos cosmonaut, became the first Russian ever to launch on a SpaceX vehicle at a time when US-Russian relations are hitting near fever pitch over the Ukraine war. Officials at NASA have said repeatedly that joint operations with Russia on the ISS, where the two countries are the primary operators, will remain isolated from the fray. Kikina's flight comes just weeks after NASA's Dr. Frank Rubio launched to the ISS aboard a Roscosmos Soyuz capsule. ""I really love my crewmates,"" Kikina told reporters after she arrived at the Florida launch site on Saturday. ""I really feel good, comfortable. ... We will do our job the best way: happy."" During a post-launch news conference, Sergei Krikalev, the executive director of Human Space Flight Programs at Roscosmos, commented on the significance of the US-Russian partnership. ""We just continue what was started many years ago, in 1975 when the Apollo-Soyuz crew worked together,"" Krikalev said, referring to an in-space meet up in 1975 that became a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation between the United States and Russia. ""Now we continue that."" READ MORE: Meet the space trailblazers of color who empowered others to dream Who are the other astronauts on board? Mann and her fellow NASA astronaut Josh Cassada, who grew up in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, both joined NASA in 2013. Cassada has described Mann as one of his ""closest friends on the planet."" As with Mann, this mission is the first trip to space for Cassada and Kikina. For veteran astronaut Wakata, who has previously flown on both NASA's space shuttle and Russia's Soyuz spacecraft, this trip marks his fifth spaceflight mission. ""I still remember when I first flew and saw our beautiful home planet,"" he recalled during an August press conference. ""It was so wonderful, such a beautiful planet, then I felt very lucky to be able to call this planet our home."" What will they do in space? After reaching the ISS, the crew will join the seven astronauts already aboard the ISS — including four NASA astronauts, a European Space Agency astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts. There will be a handover period, where the current ISS crew will help the newly arrived astronauts settle in before a separate Crew Dragon spacecraft brings the four astronauts who were part of SpaceX's Crew-4 mission back home. Then the Crew-5 astronauts will set to work conducting spacewalks, during which astronauts exit the ISS, to maintain the space station's exterior, as well as performing more than 200 science experiments. ""Experiments will include studies on printing human organs in space, understanding fuel systems operating on the Moon, and better understanding heart disease,"" according to NASA. Crew-5 is slated to return from space in about five months.",3,8.405036053357728,8.283900805665363,0.12113524769236506,11
2022-10-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/europe/ukraine-conflict-russia-losses-intl/index.html,Pro-Russia media slam war setbacks as Putin predicts annexed Ukrainian regions will stabilize,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he expects the situation to stabilize in four war-torn regions of Ukraine after signing legislation to annex them on Wednesday, despite the fact that Russia's military does not fully control those areas. While Russian state television hailed Putin's inking of the annexation process, pro-Kremlin pundits delivered rare dispatches on the growing setbacks faced by Moscow's troops on the ground. Russian forces appear to be buckling under growing pressure as Ukraine continues to regain territory in the south, where Russian soldiers have been forced to retreat from previously-held settlements as Kyiv progresses with its counteroffensive towards the Russian-occupied city of Kherson. Despite losing territory in the south to Ukrainian military at rapid pace, Putin on Wednesday signed several laws ratifying the Russian Federation's claimed annexation of four Ukrainian regions -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. In a bid to celebrate the news, Putin took the opportunity in a televised meeting for Teachers' Day to congratulate educators from ""all 89 regions of Russia,"" a number that includes the newly annexed territories. Putin said he was ""pleased"" and ""surprised"" by the referendums' results and claimed that the regions will now be stabilized and developed while ""helping strengthen the country as a whole."" The annexations are illegal under international law. World leaders have said they are the result of ""sham"" referendums that will never be recognized. Donetsk and Luhansk are both in eastern Ukraine, and fighting against Moscow-backed breakaway republics in each region has been raging since 2014. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are in southern Ukraine and have been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began in late February. Russia has vowed to take control of all of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but its goals in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are less clear, which has created confusion about the boundaries that Russia is claiming. Amid the uncertainty, Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday also issued conflicting announcements over the management of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Putin signed a decree to claim the plant, the largest complex of its kind in Europe, as under Russian state control; meanwhile the head of Energoatom, Ukraine's state nuclear energy company, said that he was taking charge. ""Undoubtedly, our work, our destiny, our homes and our future are with Ukraine, as always. We will continue to work in accordance with Ukrainian legislation, in the Ukrainian energy system, in Energoatom. Don't doubt it!"" Petro Kotin said in a video address to the plant's employees. That Russia does not have full control of the regions it claims to have seized was made clear by a map used by the Russian Defense Ministry in its daily briefing on Tuesday. The map confirmed significant Russian losses in Kherson compared to a map of the same area used in a ministry briefing a day before. It reinforces reports from Ukrainian and pro-Russian officials, as well as pro-Russian military analysts, of significant Ukrainian gains towards Kherson, down the western bank of the Dnieper River. Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, who spoke while the map was shown full-screen, did not mention the losses. However, he said that Russian military destroyed Ukrainian armor and killed Ukrainian forces in the area of several towns that are now understood to be under Ukrainian control -- a tacit acknowledgment of Kyiv's push. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the military for their ""fast and powerful advances"" in his Tuesday evening address, before celebrating that ""dozens of settlements have already been liberated"" this week. In Kherson region, he said that Liubymivka, Khreshchenivka, Zolota Balka, Biliaiivka, Ukraiinka, Velyka, Mala Oleksandrivka, and Davydiv Brid had all been reclaimed, ""and this is not a complete list."" ""Our warriors do not stop. And it is only a matter of time when we will expel the occupier from all our land,"" the president added. Zelensky on Wednesday assembled his top military and security staff to consider plans for ""further liberation of Ukrainian territories,"" according to the readout of the meeting from the President's office. In addition to Ukraine's successes in the south, Kyiv's forces made gains in Luhansk in the east with forces approaching the region from several directions, and over the weekend liberated the strategic city of Lyman, a key operational hub in Donetsk which the Russian army had used to funnel troops and supplies to the west and south. The Russian Defense Ministry said it was forced to cede Lyman or risk encirclement of its troops there, allowing Ukrainian forces to potentially use the city as a staging post to push troops further east. Asked by CNN how to interpret the language of the laws signed by Putin -- which refers to the borders of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as ""the territory which existed on the day of its adoption in the Russian Federation"" -- Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, ""I will leave this question unanswered."" When pressed to clarify by CNN, Peskov added: ""You should read the decree; there is a legal wording there. On the whole, of course, we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of its adoption [as part of the Russian Federation]."" 'Painful as getting thumped on your melon' The Russian-appointed deputy leader in the occupied Kherson region explained Ukraine's rapid advance in recent days by saying that the Russian military was ""regrouping."" ""The Russian army is conducting maneuvers,"" Kirill Stremousov told Russian state news RIA Novosti. ""The regrouping of the front in the current conditions allows us to gather strength and strike."" The phrase ""regrouping"" was also used by the Russian Defense Ministry in September to describe the retreat of the Russian military in response to Ukraine's offensive that recaptured the key city of Izium, in the Kharkiv region. Stremousov on Wednesday claimed that Ukraine's advance had been stopped, and that it was ""impossible"" for them to enter the occupied city of Kherson. However, pro-Russian media has been uncommonly critical of the war effort in recent days, delivering gloomy reports that Russia's campaign is suffering an operational crisis while Ukraine takes advantage on the battlefield. ""In the Kherson region, we have lost 17 settlements,"" Alexander Sladkov, a leading Russian war correspondent, conceded on state TV Tuesday, before placing the blame on ""fat"" US weapons deliveries and ""intelligence gathered via satellite reconnaissance."" Sladkov is just one of several Russian correspondents to convey the losses Russia is suffering. Alexander Kots, a correspondent for pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, who is embedded with Russian forces in the occupied eastern city of Svatove, told his Telegram followers Wednesday that the military lacks the manpower necessary to hold off a further Ukrainian advance into the Luhansk region. ""The Russian troops do not have enough manpower to stop the enemy attacks,"" Kots said in a video. ""The recent Russian losses are directly connected to that. It's a very difficult period of time on the front line at the moment."" He said that ""we expect a serious fighting here very soon,"" and that ""it remains to be seen if it could stop the enemy advances."" Kots confirmed that Russian forces were trying to fortify their defense at the line connecting the occupied cities of Kreminna and Svatova. Yuriy Podolyaka, a pro-Russian military blogger said on Monday that Russian troops had withdrawn to the Zherebets River, which runs just west of Kreminna and Svatova. He said that Ukrainian forces are ""on the high and enjoying a numeric advantage."" ""They don't have problems with the intelligence data or high-precision weapons which they are constantly using. We are just waiting for our reserves to become fighting fit and join the battle."" Meanwhile, state media reporter Evgeniy Poddubnyy, a correspondent for Russia 24, said Tuesday that ""we're going through the hardest time on the frontline"" and that ""for the time being it will become even harder."" Sladkov, for his part, tried to put a positive spin on things. ""This doesn't mean that we've collapsed like a house of cards. These mistakes aren't gigantic strategic failures. We are still learning. I know this is hard to hear in our eighth month of the special operation. But we are reporters. We are waiting for reinforcements. Host Olga Skabeeva appeared visibly angry, before asking Sladkov if the entire Kherson region was in danger of being lost. ""We don't have enough troops at the moment to move on Kyiv or to quickly take Kharkiv, but they are sufficient to continue protecting the territories that we are already protecting,"" he responded. ""In straightening out our front line, we've had to retreat from these settlements."" He added: ""It's as painful as getting thumped on your melon. We've suffered losses. But it's war. And these kinds of things happen in war. [Reinforcements] are coming, along with their equipment. I don't lie or engage in propaganda. I'm just a regular reporter who is describing what is happening."" Sladkov's admission on State TV was his second in less than a month, after he previously admitted that Russian forces had endured heavy losses on September 13, a Tuesday. At the beginning of this Tuesday's interview, Sladkov quipped: ""I only tell the truth on Tuesdays, and for other days I just make everything up.""",14,6.667422760436381,1.3375683772292186,5.329854383207162,8
2022-10-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/europe/russia-ukraine-annexation-intl/index.html,Russian Parliament begins process to rubber-stamp annexations as Moscow struggles to define borders,"Russia's legislature on Monday began the process of approving President Vladimir Putin's decision to annex four parts of Ukraine, despite the fact that the Kremlin is not in full control of those regions and has not settled upon the exact boundaries of the territories it is attempting to absorb. Legislative approval of the annexation, which is illegal under international law, is expected to be a formality, although it will take a couple of days. Putin and his allies effectively control both branches of the Russian legislature, and the space for political dissent in Russia has shrunk in recent years. But the maneuverings inside the ornate halls of the Kremlin stand in stark contrast to the facts on the ground in the battlefields of eastern Ukraine. Russian forces have suffered a series of surprising defeats in eastern Ukraine, forcing them to retreat and abandon several positions in areas the Kremlin declares it is annexing. Much of the territory Moscow claims as its own in Donetsk region is under the control of Ukrainian forces, and the Kremlin appears unsure of the exact borders of the regions it plans to annex. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow needed to ""continue consulting"" with the local populations before establishing its borders. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that the country had taken back Lyman, while the Ukrainian military said it had recaptured the nearby villages of Drobysheve and Torske, putting Kyiv in a better position as it seeks to take back the Luhansk region. Pro-Russian officials said Monday that Ukrainian forces had pushed into the Luhansk region, nearly all of which is under the control of Russia or Russian-aligned forces. Ukrainian forces liberated the Luhansk village of Bilohorivka at the end of September and have now gained a foothold in the direction of Lysychansk. Lysychansk was the last Ukrainian holdout in Luhansk before Kyiv withdrew its troops in July. In a third region, Kherson, Ukrainian forces are advancing and have captured several villages and settlements, including Zolota Balka on the western bank of the Dnipro river, according to a Ukrainian regional official and a pro-Russian military blogger. On Sunday, Zelensky said Ukraine's military had taken Arkhanhelske and Myroliubivka. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that he believes Ukraine is ""making progress"" in Kherson, thanks in part to weapons supplied by Washington. ""What we're seeing now is a kind of change in the battlefield dynamics,"" Austin said. ""They've done very, very well in the Kharkiv area and moved to take advantage of opportunities. The fight in the -- the Kherson region's going a bit slower, but they're making progress."" The losses have sparked an unusual amount of criticism from pro-Russian propagandists critical in recent days. One prominent Russian pro-government tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda, said Russian forces had to retreat in the strategically important city of Lyman because they lacked manpower and communicated poorly, and commanding officers there made ""mistakes."" What Russia is attempting to annex Donetsk and Luhansk are two of the four regions Russia has said it will annex. They are both home to Russian-backed breakaway republics, and fighting has been raging in both since 2014. The other areas, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, are both in southern Ukraine and have been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began in late February. In a formal speech at the Kremlin's opulent St. George's Hall on Friday, Putin announced that Russia would push forward with annexing those four regions, after so-called referendums in those areas returned results that purported to show that the majority of people living there voted in favor of acceding to Russian sovereignty. The contests have been widely panned as a farce that failed to meet internationally recognized standards of free and fair elections. Reports from the ground suggested that voting took place both essentially and literally at gunpoint. Countries across the world quickly condemned Putin's announcement that the regions would be annexed. Members of the G7 -- Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States -- and the European Union said they would never recognize the Kremlin's sovereignty over the regions and vowed to ""impose further economic costs on Russia."" EU member states began summoning Russian ambassadors in a coordinated manner on Friday to ""convey strong condemnation of these actions"" and demand the ""immediate halt to steps undermining Ukraine's territorial integrity and violating UN Charter and international law,"" a spokesman for the bloc said.",14,1.7021601436626814,2.3612964320643366,-0.6591362884016552,8
2022-10-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/02/europe/ukraine-lyman-visit-intl/index.html,"CNN team visits key city of Lyman, hours after Ukraine regains control from Russian forces","The ghostly emptiness of the streets of Lyman in eastern Ukraine belies this city's strategic significance. There are no signs of Russian troops at all on Sunday -- few damaged Russian tanks, or Russian dead, or Russian prisoners. Members of the Ukrainian National Guard from the Dnipro-1 unit hover in small numbers on some streets. The occasional rattle of gunfire, or thud of artillery, pierces the silence. A few locals emerge, riding bicycles, searching for food, bewildered about what is happening. ""One day I wear one cap, another day a different cap,"" said one woman in tears, pretending to take off a hat. ""How can we live like this,"" she said, referring to the changing control of the town. CNN was among the first media outlets into the recently liberated city, arriving 30 minutes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared the town completely cleared of Russians troops. Ukrainian officials and troops had spoken repeatedly of large numbers of Moscow's better units being trapped there. Yet on Sunday there were few signs of encirclement to be seen. Some officials said Russian corpses had already been cleared away and prisoners removed. But locals offered another explanation: that Russian forces had left the city on Friday in an orderly fashion. ""They got on their tanks, and drove out,"" said Tanya, riding her bicycle back to the bomb shelter, where she still spends the nights with 15 others. A Ukrainian army spokesman, asked to respond to CNN's reporting, denied there had been a Russian withdrawal two days ago, saying there had been fighting in the area as recently as Saturday. Sergiy Cherevatiy, of the Eastern Group of Armed Forces of Ukraine, said Russian troops had formed convoys to break through the de facto encirclement of the city. Some succeeded in getting out, he said, while others had been hit. The possibility Russian forces may have conducted, even in part, an orderly withdrawal on Friday raises an important question of timing for the Kremlin. During that day, Russian President Vladimir Putin was signing documents falsely claiming to annex Lyman, and other parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, and holding a rally in Moscow's Red Square claiming victory would be Russia's. At the same time, it now appears his military were pulling out of Lyman, in one of the most significant Russian defeats for weeks -- a withdrawal that may have a knock-on effect for Russian control of occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk. The switch back to Ukrainian control in Lyman was swift, with one local already painting the Ukrainian gold and blue colors back on the gate of the local police station. Inside the building, the damage had already been swept away and rooms tidied. In the local administration building, Roman sat on a table near a flag of the ""United Russia"" party. ""Bad,"" he said, describing the months of Russian control. ""No electricity or water."" He added that the administration building was used to manage and corral locals into participating in the recent referendum, which in Lyman must have occurred under the full barrage of Ukraine's advance. Lyman's significant railway infrastructure has been heavily damaged, the roofs blown off the station building and rolling stock on the railways damaged. Multiple buildings in the town have been heavily destroyed, yet on Sunday the streets seemed in some areas to have been already swept clean. Many of the Ukrainian troops had already moved on towards the next target in Russia's rapidly faltering lines of defense -- Kremmina, further to the east.",14,3.540507486378864,1.3806245853697914,2.1598829010090728,8
2022-10-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/01/europe/ukraine-russia-lyman-donetsk-intl/index.html,Russian forces retreat from strategic Donetsk city a day after Moscow's annexation of the region,"Russian forces retreated from Lyman, a strategic city for its operations in the east, the Russian defense ministry said Saturday, just a day after Moscow's annexation of the region that's been declared illegal by the West. ""In connection with the creation of a threat of encirclement, allied troops were withdrawn from the settlement of Krasny Liman to more advantageous lines,"" the ministry said on Telegram, using the Russian name for the town of Lyman. Russian state media Russia-24 reported that the reason for Russia's withdrawal was because ""the enemy used both Western-made artillery and intelligence from North Atlantic alliance countries."" The retreat marks Ukraine's most significant gain since its successful counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region last month. Russia's announcement comes just hours after Ukrainian forces said they had encircled Russian troops in the city, which is located in the Kramatorsk district of Donetsk. Ukrainian forces said earlier Saturday that they had entered Stavky, a village neighboring Lyman, according to Serhii Cherevatyi, the military spokesperson for the eastern grouping of Ukrainian forces. ""The Russian group in the area of Lyman is surrounded. The settlements of Yampil, Novoselivka, Shandryholove, Drobysheve, and Stavky are liberated. Stabilization measures are ongoing there,"" Cherevatyi said in a televised press conference on Saturday morning. ""[The liberation] of Lyman is important, because it is another step towards the liberation of the Ukrainian Donbas. This is an opportunity to go further to Kreminna and Severodonetsk. Therefore, in turn, it is psychologically very important,"" he said. Cherevatyi said the Ukrainian troops actions are setting the tone to ""break the course of these hostilities."" He added that there had been ""many killed and wounded,"" but could not provide any further details. The head of Luhansk regional military administration Serhiy Hayday also revealed Saturday further details of the Lyman offensive, suggesting Russian forces had offered to retreat, but to no avail from the Ukrainian side. ""Occupiers asked [their command] for possibility to retreat, and they have been refused. Accordingly, they have two options. No, they actually have three options. Try to break through, surrender, or everyone there will die,"" Hayday said. ""There are several thousand of them. Yes, about 5,000. There is no exact number yet. Five thousand is still a colossal grouping. There has never been such a large group in the encirclement before. All routes for the supply of ammunition or the retreat of the group are all completely blocked,"" he added. Yurii Mysiagin, Ukrainian member of Parliament and deputy head of the parliament's committee on national security, referenced the move into Stavky on Saturday by publishing a video on Telegram showing a Ukrainian tank moving up the road with a clear sign indicating the region of Stavky. CNN could not independently verify the original source or the date. A video posted on social media, and shared by President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff, shows two Ukrainian soldiers standing on a military vehicle attaching the flag with tape to a large sign with the word ""Lyman."" ""We are unfurling our country's flag and planting it on our land. On Lyman. Everything will be Ukraine,"" one of the soldiers says to the camera. Chechen leader's threat Meanwhile, pressure appears to be growing on Russian President Vladimir Putin to use nuclear weapons on the battlefield. Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the Chechen republic, in an angry statement slamming Russian generals in the wake of the withdrawal from Lyman, said it was time for the Kremlin to make use of every weapon at his disposal. ""In my personal opinion we need to take more drastic measures, including declaring martial law in the border territories and using low-yield nuclear weapons,"" Kadyrov said on his Telegram channel. ""There is no need to make every decision with the Western American community in mind."" Earlier this week, Dmitry Medvedev, who served as Russia's President between 2008 and 2012, discussed nuclear weapons use on his Telegram channel, saying it was permitted if the existence of the Russian state was threatened by an attack even by conventional forces. ""If the threat to Russia exceeds our established threat limit, we will have to respond ... this is certainly not a bluff,"" he wrote. Concerns have risen sharply that Moscow could resort to nuclear weapons use after Putin's proclamation on Friday that Russia would seize nearly a fifth of Ukraine, declaring that the millions of people living there would be Russian citizens ""forever."" The announcement was dismissed as illegal by the United States and many other countries, but the fear is the Kremlin might argue that attacks on those territories now constitute attacks on Russia. In his speech in the Kremlin, the Russian leader made only passing reference to nuclear weapons, noting the United States was the only country to have used them on the battlefield. ""By the way, they created a precedent,"" he added. Nuclear power plant chief held Also on Saturday, the director-general of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was detained by a Russian patrol, according to the president of state nuclear company Energoatom. Director-General Ihor Murashov was in his vehicle on his way from the plant when he was ""stopped ... taken out of the car, and with his eyes blindfolded he was driven in an unknown direction. For the time being there is no information on his fate,"" Energoatom's Petro Kotin said in a statement. ""Murashov is a licensed person and bears main and exclusive responsibility for the nuclear and radiation safety of the Zaporizhzhya NPP,"" Kotin said, adding, that his detention ""jeopardizes the safety of operation of Ukraine and Europe's largest nuclear power plant."" Kotin called for Murashov's release, and urged the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ""take all possible immediate actions to urgently free"" him. Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs ""strongly"" condemned Murashov's ""illegal detention,"" calling it a ""another manifestation of state terrorism from the side of Russia and a gross violation of international law."" ""We call on the international community, in particular the UN, the IAEA and the G7, to also take decisive measures to this end,"" the ministry said in a statement. Overnight, Russia hit Zaporizhzhia with four S300 missiles, according to the head of the regional administration Oleksandr Starukh. And in Kharkiv, the Regional Prosecutor's Office said Saturday that the bodies of 22 civilians, including 10 children, were found following Russian shelling on a convoy of cars near the eastern town of Kupiansk. The cars were shot by the Russian army on September 25 ""when civilians were trying to evacuate,"" it said in a Telegram post, adding that an investigation was ongoing. Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) and police had ""discovered a convoy of seven cars that had been shot dead near the village of Kurylivka, Kupiansk district,"" on Friday, Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office said. The SBU confirmed on Telegram they would be investigating a ""war crime"" where at least 20 people died in ""a brutal attack."" CNN could not independently verify the allegations.

2022-09-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/europe/ukraine-offensive-sviatogirsk-intl/index.html,"In ghostly Sviatogirsk, Russia's challenge in annexing territory it cannot control is laid bare","It is a road through scorched forest, open roofs and pockmarked asphalt where the devastation appears to seamlessly meld together into an endless line. Ukraine's push south from Kharkiv to Donetsk has been less advertised and heralded than its rout of Russian troops around the city of Kharkiv. But from a two-hour drive south to the monastery town of Sviatogirsk, it appears this military operation may be just as decisive. Village after village, swept clear of Russian forces, with torn and rusting armor mixed with freshly smoldering tanks, line the country roads. The extent of the firepower employed by both sides, and also the accuracy of Ukraine's newer Western-supplied weapons, is clear from the ghostly silence in so many tiny settlements. Access to this fast-advancing front line was provided to CNN by Ukraine in a likely bid to display the gains Ukrainian forces have slowly made in this lower-profile offensive, which has been underway since the city of Izium fell earlier this month. The ultimate goal is the city of Lyman, a railway hub whose outsized significance seems due to Russia's staunch defense of the town, but also the significant advantage seizing the town would give Ukraine in its bid to retake the rest of the Luhansk region, coveted by Russia and partially occupied since 2014. A separate push appears underway by Ukrainian forces slightly further northeast, towards the town of Svatove, and its south, pressuring the town of Rubizhne, which is also vital to Russia's hold on Luhansk. Some analysts suggest Kyiv may be looking to provoke a similar domino effect to that which caused Russian forces around Kharkiv to collapse. Some ambitions rest on Lyman's encirclement cascading and causing a Russian retreat from towns behind this logistical hub. A Ukrainian soldier sent CNN video Thursday of abandoned Russian positions from Lypove and Zelena Dolyna, which would show swift progress towards the town of Torske, to Lyman's east. In short, incremental gains by Ukraine's forces are beginning to alter the specter of continued Russian control in Luhansk. This change comes in the hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to sign a decree formally and falsely declaring the occupied regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhizhe and Kherson as part of Russia. In the town of Sviatogirsk, the challenge of Moscow annexing territory that Russian forces are slowly losing control of is laid bare. The quiet pines of the forests around its Cave Monastery are now blighted by the sheer force of the violence inflicted on this peaceful resort town. Holiday camps and hotels were seized and occupied by Russian forces and then used to house liberating Ukrainian troops. It has the look of a town that will struggle to ever be itself again. Walking down the center of an empty, central street, weeping, and clutching pine branches that will later burn to heat her tea, is 73-year-old Anna. It is the town's most fragile who were left behind, it seems. Sobbing, she explains only nine people remain in her apartment block, and she nearly did not make it. ""The scariest moment was when the Russians one night were in a firefight in my courtyard,"" she said. ""I was in the doorway, and tried to hold the steel door shut. But a soldier pulled at the door, so I jumped down and fell into the basement. He tore open the door, shot his gun into the darkness and missed me."" Close by, outside a ravaged post office, is Lyuba, who is hard of hearing, but incensed by the mess that the Russian occupiers have made of the new building. She wears on her shirt a lock of hair, caught in a plastic zip-lock bag on a safety pin. It is from a local priest, beloved to her, who was killed by shelling in June. ""I just attached it as a protective amulet,"" said Lyuba. Then, in a panic, she asked: ""Do you think they will come back? Tell me, can I leave here now?"" Across the street is the local administration building, hit powerfully with a single rocket. Yet on its walls remain the dark graffiti of Russia's occupying force. ""Forgive us,"" reads one comment. Another wall bears the phrase ""Rostov is Dad, Odessa Mum"" in red spray paint -- hinting at the shared history and parentage of many Russians with Ukraine. Ukrainian soldier Dmytro, from the Kulchitskiy Battalion, who took part in the counteroffensive to liberate Sviatogirsk, said they watched the Russians a long time before attacking. ""You have to understand the psychology of someone who comes to a foreign land,"" he said. ""His mass media and his commander may tell him foolish idea, but when he gets here, he realizes he is really in alien territory."" Locals stagger around the carnage of the town. It is hard to find a single building that is intact, or has any chance of providing shelter in the coming winter. Even the town's second monastery is pockmarked by shellfire. Yet in its cold, dark but orderly basement, dozens hid during the worst fighting and a handful still find shelter.

""My children have left, been evacuated, and my apartment is destroyed,"" she said. ""Is it possible to leave here now?""

2022-09-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/europe/russia-ukraine-annexation-analysis-intl/index.html,Annexation fails to hide gulf between what Putin wants and what his forces can hold,"It was a moment of two completely incompatible events. One staged in Moscow, of a pen on paper, theater and imperialist expansion. The other the slow, methodical advance of Ukraine's forces through poorly supplied and commanded Russian positions. Friday laid bare the stark gulf between Russia's ambitions and its reality. As Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted a remarkable, fake ceremony -- in the grandeur of the Kremlin's St. George's Hall and with and orchestrated crowds of support at a rally outside -- his forces were losing in a strategic town in the very area he claims to annex. Thursday night's signatures on two decrees annexing Kherson and Zaporizhzhia areas began the Potemkin farce. Part of Zaporizhzhia remains in Ukrainian hands, and slowly bits of Kherson are being prised away. Yet Moscow claimed at the moment in which the decree was posted online, these occupied areas suddenly became Russia. Indeed, Ukrainian officials say 23 civilians were killed when an apparent S300 missile strike hit a convoy of cars outside Zaporizhzhia city that were planning to drive into occupied territory to deliver aid and evacuate those allowed to leave. An act of savagery that began the area's first day under what Russia considers its protective umbrella. Ukraine's advances are gathering pace. Their focus is the railway hub of Lyman, which has gained outsized importance because of Russia's dogged defense and the strategic role it may have in their control of the entire Luhansk region. Putin signed papers Friday claiming falsely this region has now become Russia and he will do so to a backdrop of extremely bad news. A Ukrainian soldier posted a video Friday in front of the administration building of Yampil, a tiny settlement to Lyman's east, from which Russia has apparently retreated, suggesting that Lyman is for the most part isolated to its rear from the rest of the Russian military. Regular Russian army forces, national guard and some volunteer units are said to remain in the city in a significant number. Cut off, their decision to fight or surrender makes little difference to Ukraine's continued advance. The Ukrainian moves may again highlight one of the strategic flaws of Russia's positioning -- that it seems to fight hard for one location in the belief its defense will hold, and then struggle to regroup when the ""impossible"" happens. The Ukrainian encirclement of the supply hub of Izium was central to the recent rout of Russian forces all over Kharkiv region. The coming days will tell if the fate of Lyman is similarly key to Luhansk region. Indeed, the central policy takeaway from Putin's Friday rant against the West -- a direct call for a ceasefire and a return to the negotiating table -- reflected how the annexation ceremony was taking place against the backdrop of extremely bad news militarily. Not that the calls for talks are likely to be heeded: Ukraine and its Western allies have dismissed Russian calls for diplomacy, pointing to Moscow's history of using the opportunity of negotiations to regroup on the battlefield. Back on the ground, Ukraine's methodical and deliberate progress is a cold dose of reality for a Kremlin that still seems to think it can create reality by the force of its own will. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the parts of Luhansk and Donetsk that Russia does not control will have to be ""liberated"" -- a statement that totally fails to recognize that the direction of travel on the battlefield is going the other way. So what is to be done? Moscow still seems set on the idea that ""partial mobilization"" will eventually improve their fortunes. Yet instead, it appears to expose again the gap between reality and fiction -- between modern warfare and their belief in volume and persistence. Russia continues to attack objectives head on, with as much force as possible, and may hope tens of thousands of conscripts, poorly equipped and trained, can overwhelm positions it has so far struggled to take. But they face a modernizing Ukrainian military, with precise Western weapons and useful tactical advice, that simply out-maneuvers them. Why attack a town head on, when you can go around the back of it and cut it off? The cracks in Putin's Potemkin world are beginning to let the light in. His public appearance admonishing his own officials for the appalling execution of the partial mobilization is rare: This was a policy he announced, and so families whose fathers and husbands have been torn away to war will want to see things reversed swiftly, before the body bags start coming home. They are unlikely to be mollified by an acceptance from a ""benevolent tsar"" that things should have been handled better. Some 200,000 Russians have fled the country since the mobilization was announced, likely many more than have since been forced into army uniform. In his Friday speech, Putin talked up the use of ""all"" means at his disposal to defend these newly annexed parts of Ukraine, but he did not specifically threaten to use nuclear force. He did however say the US use of such weapons against Japan created a precedent. It is a threat, but it is veiled, not direct, and each of these words and postures is carefully chosen. We are again at a point where we have to ask what a nuclear power does when its conventional forces are shown to be unable to achieve its military goals? It is important to remember that a nuclear power becomes such normally because it has a solid conventional foundation for its forces. With the exception of Pakistan and North Korea, most of the nuclear powers would likely be able to achieve their military goals without resorting to the Bomb. But Russia is persistently proving its actual army is not up to the tasks it has been set. And that failure likely reflects on the readiness of its nuclear forces: how can you be sure in the Kremlin that your nuclear arsenal is up to scratch if your tanks can't get diesel 40 miles from your own border? The days ahead will be febrile enough that this is a question nobody should seek to answer. But we are slowly seeing the gulf between what Russia wants, what it can do and what is actually happening -- a gulf it normally filled with fear and threatening rhetoric -- being exposed on the world stage. How Moscow reacts will decide the world we live in in the next decades.",14,1.5869274423891564,3.9732579640478147,-2.3863305216586586,17

2022-09-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/europe/yevgeny-prigozhin-wagner-russia-intl/index.html,Putin's 'chef' Prigozhin admits creating Wagner mercenary outfit in 2014,"Yevgeny Prigozhin, one of Russia's most elusive oligarchs, now admits to founding the private military company known as Wagner in 2014, reversing years of denials about his connection to the shadowy outfit. Prigozhin is so close to the Kremlin that he is known as Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""chef."" On social media on Monday, Prigozhin released a statement via his company Concord Catering, which began by saying, ""Let's go briefly over the origins."" In a lengthy, colorful statement he went on to say that the 2014 Russian-backed separatist movements in the Donbas in eastern Ukraine were the catalyst for its founding. Prigozhin claimed that he personally ""cleaned the old weapons, figured out the bulletproof vests myself and found specialists who could help me with this. From that moment, from May 1, 2014, a group of patriots was born."" CNN has tracked Wagner mercenaries in the Central African Republic, Sudan, Libya, Mozambique, Ukraine and Syria. Over the years they have developed a particularly gruesome reputation and have been linked to various human rights abuses. In 2019, a CNN team managed to gain access to a Wagner training base in CAR. Two years later, CNN uncovered atrocious human rights abuses committed by Russian fighters in the country. Intercepted communications shared with CNN in 2020 even showed an operation by Russian operatives to track and surveil CNN journalists as they reported on Wagner's operations in CAR the previous year. More recently, the group has set up in Mali, where human rights groups allege they have been involved in a horrendous spate of murders. Prigozhin was sanctioned in 2019 by the United States for his role in running an internet troll factory, accused of attempting to undermine the 2016 US presidential election. Observers say Wagner has often acted as an unofficial arm of Russian foreign policy, even though mercenary activity is technically illegal in Russia. No longer camera-shy For years, Prigozhin has consistently denied links to the Wagner group. He has filed court cases against Russian media outlets that had investigated him, and belittled journalists who questioned him. But his announcement Monday appears to be the culmination of a gradual emergence from the shadows over the course of the past several weeks -- and may reflect shifting power balances in Russia as Putin's campaign in Ukraine falters. Earlier in September, a video appeared online with a bald, portly man appearing to be Prigozhin promising clemency to Russian prisoners for six months of military service. Another showed what seemed to be the same man speaking to military commanders. In the video showing what appeared to be Prigozhin with the convicts, he says: ""I am a representative for a private military company. You've probably heard of us, PMC Wagner."" He adds: ""The first prisoners who fought with me, participated June 1 during the storming of the Vugledar power plant. Forty men went into the trenches of the enemy and cut them down with knives."" In the days following the video's appearance online, 'Concord', Prigozhin's company, issued a bizarre statement, neither confirming, nor denying, who the figure was in the video. ""Indeed, we can confirm that the person in the video is monstrously similar to Yevgeny Viktorovich [Prigozhin],"" it said. ""In addition the person's speech in the video is very well delivered, just like that of Evgeny Viktorovich [Prigozhin]. And a person who looks like Evgeny Viktorovich [Prigozhin] very intelligibly explains simple understandable things to ordinary people."" More recently, the same man appeared at a funeral for a Wagner fighter. Clad in khaki, he was seen (on video) shaking hands, offering condolences to the family gathered around the coffin of their son. Then, just days ago, the supposedly camera-shy ""chef"" appeared in social media videos showing him stepping off a helicopter for a late night meeting with his advisers. In it, another admission. A huge arrival of recruits is imminent. Prigozhin can be heard saying: ""We're about to get a great influx of those who want, plainly speaking, to perform special tasks, go to war."" A voice asks if they can leak the video. ""Leak away, so they know we're not just picking our noses here,"" Prigozhin replies. Asked in Monday's social media post why he has now ceased to deny his involvement with the Wagner group, Prigozhin said: ""For a long time I avoided the blows of many opponents with one main goal -- so as not to frame up these guys [fighters], who are the basis of Russian patriotism."" Calls for a new man in charge? As Moscow's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine stumbles, the search to replenish the battered and humiliated ranks has taken a nasty twist. A CNN investigation in August uncovered evidence that Wagner recruiters were touring Russia's penal colonies on the hunt for recruits to join their ranks. Their reward -- six months duty for a healthy salary and, if they survived, freedom. If they died, there would be a lump-sum payment to their families. When Putin last week announced a partial mobilization of the country, following sweeping battlefield gains by Ukraine, the move sparked protests, anger and a mass exodus of Russia's service-age males. Marina Miron, from the Defence Studies Department at King's College London, suggested the call-up and use of Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine shouldn't be viewed with any surprise since its fighters serve a special purpose. ""It's not a departure from the usual modus operandi. They are sending them to do the heavy lifting,"" she said, citing the brutal actions of Wagner mercenaries who fought for control of the Syrian city of Palmyra, as well their role in Libya and Ukraine. The ever-growing list of battlefield failures have led Russian military bloggers to go so far as to suggest in posts on platforms like Telegram that a new man needs to take over the war effort. That man, many believe, should be Prigozhin. These factors may go some way to describing his sudden love for the camera -- and first open acknowledgment of his role in Wagner. ""In the last couple of months, he has tried to get more credit, and be recognized publicly and has become an unlikely hero for militants, even other soldiers who are unhappy with incompetence of their military leaders and are adoring YP very aggressive stance,"" Christo Grozev from Bellingcat, an online investigative outfit, told CNN in an interview conducted before Prigozhin's announcement. But, Grozev added, Prigozhin's ambitions may not be limited to just public relations. ""The other day, he sent a warm greeting to one of the African countries' presidents. He has also been extolling the virtues of closed societies such as China and North Korea. So one begins to wonder whether he has some political ambitions,"" he said. Prigozhin is clearly dragging himself and Wagner out of the shadows. The announcement of his ownership marks a new chapter in Wagner's now more public existence. The move also begs the question, have Russia's blunders on the battlefield forced Prigozhin and his fearsome brigade of fighters into the public domain, and will he want political repayment for it?",13,3.3892420237790066,5.599022460027461,-2.2097804362484545,3
2022-09-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/politics/russia-military-divided-ukraine-putin/index.html,"Russia's military divided as Putin struggles to deal with Ukraine's counteroffensive, US sources say","Russia's military is divided over how best to counter Ukraine's unexpected battlefield advances this month, according to multiple sources familiar with US intelligence, as Moscow has found itself on the defensive in both the east and the south. Russian President Vladimir Putin is himself giving directions directly to generals in the field, two sources familiar with US and western intelligence said-- a highly unusual management tactic in a modern military that these sources said hints at the dysfunctional command structure that has plagued Russia's war from the beginning. Intelligence intercepts have captured Russian officers arguing among themselves and complaining to friends and relatives back home about decision-making from Moscow, one of these sources told CNN. And there are significant disagreements on strategy with military leaders struggling to agree on where to focus their efforts to shore up defensive lines, multiple sources familiar with US intelligence said. The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed that it is redeploying forces toward Kharkiv in the northeast -- where Ukraine has made the most dramatic gains -- but US and western sources say the bulk of Russian troops still remain in the south, where Ukraine has also mounted offensive operations around Kherson. Putin announced a partial mobilization on Wednesday that is expected to include the call-up of up to 300,000 reservists. He has for months resisted taking that step and Biden administration officials said Wednesday that the fact he has moved to do so now highlights the severity of Russia's manpower shortages and signals a growing desperation. It's not clear that the mobilization will make any operational difference on the battlefield, or merely prolong the length of the war without changing the outcome, according to Russian military analysts. Blame game And while Russia flails on the battlefield, officials in Moscow have scrambled to assign blame for Russia's abrupt turn in fortunes, a senior NATO official said. ""Kremlin officials and state media pundits have been feverishly discussing the reasons for the failure in Kharkiv and in typical fashion, the Kremlin seems to be attempting to deflect the blame away from Putin and onto the Russian military,"" this person said. Already, there has been a reshuffling of military leadership in response to the battlefield failures -- leaving Russia's command structure even more jumbled than it was before, sources say. The commander who oversaw the majority of the units around the Kharkiv region had been in the post only 15 days and has now been relieved of duty, the NATO official said. Russia has sent ""a small number"" of troops into eastern Ukraine -- some of whom had fled amid Ukraine's battlefield advances last week, according to two US defense officials -- an effort to shore up its weakened defensive lines. But even if Russia is able to coalesce around a plan, US and western officials believe Russia is limited in its ability to mount a strategically significant response to Ukraine's counteroffensive operations that in recent days, sources say, has swung the momentum in Kyiv's favor. Even after the announcement of the partial mobilization, officials are skeptical that Russia is capable of quickly deploying large numbers of troops into Ukraine given its ongoing problems with supply lines, communications and morale. The ""small scale"" of the Russian redeployment is a signal of its inability to mount any serious operations, the senior defense official told CNN. So far, Russia has responded to Ukraine's advances by launching attacks against critical infrastructure like dams and power plants -- attacks that the US sees as largely ""revenge"" attacks rather than operationally significant salvos, this person said. Absent more manpower that, right now, it simply doesn't have, sources said Russia has few other options to penalize or push back Ukrainian forces. Putin is ""struggling,"" National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said in an appearance on CNN on Wednesday. Russia's military has ""poor unit cohesion, desertions in the ranks, soldiers not wanting to fight,"" Kirby said. ""He has terrible morale, unit cohesion on the battlefield, command and control has still not been solved. He's got desertion problems and he's forcing the wounded back into the fight. So clearly, manpower is a problem for him,"" Kirby said. ""He feels like he's on his back foot, particularly in that northeast area of the Donbass."" Mobilization order a sign Putin's plan isn't working Putin's mobilization order is significant because it is a direct acknowledgment that Moscow's ""special military operation"" wasn't working and needed to be adjusted, military analysts said. But for now, there are more questions than answers about its precise operational impact. It's the first such order handed down in Russia since World War II, offering military analysts limited modern data on which to base their predictions. Even if Moscow can grow its number of soldiers -- both by preventing existing contract service members from leaving service and by mobilizing reservists -- it will struggle to train, equip and integrate these troops into existing units, said Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses. And even if that solves some near-term manpower problems, these will likely not be high-quality recruits, Kofman and others noted. Even in the best-case scenario, it will also take Moscow some time to field fresh troops. ""I think it's reasonable to say that partial mobilization probably will not reflect itself on the battlefield for several months at the earliest, and could expand Russia's ability to sustain this war, but not alter its outcome,"" Kofman said. Russia's longstanding failures in planning, communications and logistics have been compounded by punishing losses in its retreat from around Kharkiv, sources said. Russia left behind ""a lot"" of equipment in its retreat, according to the NATO official. And at least one storied unit, from the First Guards Tank Army, has been ""decimated,"" this person said. ""With its northern axis all but collapsed, this will make it harder for Russian forces to slow the Ukrainian advance, as well as to provide cover for the retreating Russian troops,"" the official said. ""We think it will also severely impair Russia's plans to occupy the entirety of the Donbas."" The wild card remains, as always, the Russian President. Putin on Wednesday once again threatened the use of nuclear weapons, a threat the US officials have said they are taking ""seriously"" but have seen no immediate indication he is planning on following through on. Pro-Russian authorities in some eastern occupied regions of Ukraine have also announced their intention to hold political referendums on joining Russia, a maneuver some analysts say Russia could use as a pretext for military action. But, the senior NATO official said, ""Overall, Russia now finds itself on the defensive. Ukraine has the initiative, forcing Russia to take stopgap measures simply to avoid further losses."" ""If Ukraine succeeds in undertaking sustained defensive operations, this could even further undermine the sustainability of Russian defenses,"" this person said.",14,2.690589520585873,1.0801372386593573,1.610452281926516,12

With his invasion of Ukraine faltering badly, the Russian President on Wednesday announced the immediate ""partial mobilization"" of Russian citizens. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Russian television that the country will call up 300,000 reservists. If they end up facing Ukrainian guns on the front lines, they are likely to become the newest casualties in the invasion Putin started more than seven months ago and that has seen the Russian military fail at almost every aspect of modern war. ""The Russian military is not currently equipped to rapidly and effectively deploy 300,000 reservists,"" said Alex Lord, Europe and Eurasia specialist at the Sibylline strategic analysis firm in London. ""Russia is already struggling to effectively equip its professional forces in Ukraine, following significant equipment losses during the war,"" Lord said. The recent Ukrainian offensive, which has seen Kyiv recapture thousands of square meters of territory, has taken a significant toll. The Institute for the Study of War earlier this week said analysis from Western experts and Ukrainian intelligence found Russia had lost 50% to 90% of its strength in some units due to that offensive, and vast amounts of armor. And that comes on top of staggering equipment losses over the course of the war. The open source intelligence website Oryx, using only losses confirmed by photographic or video evidence, has found Russian forces have lost more than 6,300 vehicles, including 1,168 tanks, since the fighting began. ""In practice, they don't have enough modern equipment ... for that many new troops,"" said Jakub Janovsky, a military analyst who contributes to the Oryx blog. JT Crump, CEO of Sibylline and a veteran of 20 years in the British military, said Russia is beginning to suffer ammunition shortages in some calibers and is looking for sources of key components so it can repair or build replacements for weapons lost on the battlefield. It's not just tanks and armored personnel carriers that have been lost. In many cases, Russian troops haven't had the basics in Ukraine, including a clear definition of what they are risking their lives for. Despite Wednesday's mobilization order, Putin is still calling Ukraine a ""special military operation,"" not a war. Ukrainian soldiers know they are fighting for their homeland. Many Russian soldiers have no idea why they are in Ukraine. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis noted this on Wednesday, calling Putin's partial mobilization announcement ""a sign of desperation."" ""I think that people definitely do not want to go to a war that they do not understand. ... People would be taken to jail if they were to call Russia's war in Ukraine a war, and now suddenly they have to go in and fight it unprepared, without weapons, without body armor, without helmets,"" he said. But even if they did have all the equipment, weapons and motivation they need, getting 300,000 troops quickly trained for battle would be impossible, experts said. ""Neither the extra officers nor facilities necessary for a mass mobilization exist now in Russia,"" said Trent Telenko, a former quality control auditor for the US' Defense Contract Management Agency who has studied Russian logistics. Reforms in 2008, aimed at modernizing and professionalizing the Russian military, removed many of the logistical and command and control structures that had once enabled the forces of the old Soviet Union to rapidly train and equip vast numbers of mobilized conscripts. Lord, at Sibylline, said it would take at least three months to gather, train and deploy Russian reservists. ""At which time we will be in the depths of a Ukrainian winter,"" Lord said. ""As such, we're unlikely to see an influx of reservists have a serious impact on the battlefield until spring 2023 -- and even then they are likely to be poorly trained and ill-equipped."" Mark Hertling, a former US Army general and CNN analyst, said he had seen firsthand how poor Russian training could be during visits to the country. ""It was awful...rudimentary first aid, very few simulations to conserve resources, and...most importantly...horrible leadership,"" Hertling wrote on Twitter. ""Placing 'newbies' on a front line that has been mauled, has low morale and who don't want to be (there) portends more (Russian) disaster. ""Jaw-dropping,"" Hertling tweeted. Telenko said newly mobilized troops would likely become just the latest casualties in Putin's war. ""Russia can draft bodies. It can't rapidly train, equip and most importantly lead them. ""Untrained waves of 20 to 50 something men with AK something assault rifles and no radios will fall apart at the first Ukrainian artillery or armored attack,"" he said.",14,0.8889213812836307,6.07399695022913,-5.1850755689455,24

2022-09-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/europe/russian-mercenaries-wagner-bombard-bakhmut-intl-hnk/index.html,Russian mercenaries bombard Bakhmut as Moscow searches for a win,"In the ruins of an apartment block tarred with soot and clouded in dust amid constant shelling, a small group of Ukrainian soldiers are face to face with a new type of Russian enemy: mercenaries, some of whom may be convicts sent to the front line. The battle is as heated as it is crucial around the city of Bakhmut. Russian positions are within 200 meters of the Ukrainian military unit that CNN has joined. The unit is caught in a gruesome artillery duel, sheltering in basements, and using commercially purchased drones as the best line of defense and intelligence. Through broken windows, from inside rooms littered with rubble, Ukrainian soldiers look across the neighboring field, pockmarked with countless blackened craters from artillery impacts. ""They can see us here,"" said one Ukrainian soldier, pointing into the distance. This is a new type of fighter on the front line. Moscow's manpower has dwindled after as many as 80,000 casualties, according to US officials, leading Moscow to turn to the country's sprawling private sector of mercenaries, namely the Wagner group. The Wagner group is allegedly run by the man known as ""Putin's Chef"", Yevgeny Prigozhin. A man matching Prigozhin's appearance recently appeared in a video in a Russian prison yard, extolling to prisoners the virtues of joining his Wagner group and fighting on the front line. Here in Bakhmut is where that system is put into ruthless action. This city has been the focus of Russian forces in the past weeks, even as they abandon positions around Kharkiv and appear to struggle to hold ground elsewhere. Wagner mercenaries have been deployed to that fight, according to multiple reports from Russian media, and have been making gains around the eastern edges of the city. The mercenaries' attacks are often devastatingly callous: the Ukrainians tell CNN that the Wagner fighters rush at them with small arms attacks, causing the Ukrainians to fire at them to protect their positions. The gunfire then gives away where the Ukrainians are, allowing the Russian artillery to target with greater accuracy. The attacks are regular, and the shelling is almost constant. ""We see an enemy mortar unit. They're preparing to fire at us,"" a drone operator said, looking into his monitor. During CNN's time with this unit on Tuesday, shells landed intermittently nearby, at one point shaking the walls of the basement shelter. Here, a Ukrainian officer, known by his call sign ""Price"", tells CNN about the last Russian they took prisoner. ""We are fighting a bit with those musicians,"" he said, referencing the Wagner group, named after the composer. ""There was one Wagner guy we caught. He was a convict, from Russia -- I don't remember exactly where from. It was get shot or surrender for him. They act professionally, not like usual infantry units,"" he said. ""The real problem is artillery, it is really precise,"" he added. As he spoke, another shell slammed near the shelter. Bakhmut's city center is now littered with large craters from Russian shelling, with main streets torn up, and the stadium's seating torn in two. Analysts believe the city could provide Moscow with a strategic position in the Donbass from which to advance further north towards Sloviansk and Kramatorsk -- and offer a badly needed strategic victory at a time of spiraling losses. At a series of trenches at another front line, buried in the forests, Martyn, another Ukrainian officer, agreed. ""[The Russians] retreated elsewhere and they need a victory, something significant, so they throw forces here,"" he said. ""Of course we have casualties, not today in our unit. But you can't avoid dead or wounded, sometimes heavily injured."" These losses have been intensely personal. ""I lost my close friend, five days after we came here. His nickname was Dancer,"" he said. Like with so many call signs or nicknames, Martyn has no idea why his friend got this one. Around the city, local life is punctuated with massive blasts from the shelling. One local, Andrei, has eyes forlorn and dark that speak to the explosions, the lack of electricity, water and calm. Still, he said of his street, ""It's not too bad, only every second house is ruined."" Helping many eke out a life is Natalia, selling potatoes -- half a ton of them in this one morning alone. ""Who knows where the shelling is coming or going,"" she said, as another loud blast caused her to laugh nervously. ""Don't be scared,"" she added. On Wednesday, Bakhmut's streets appeared emptier and the shelling appeared to intensify on the eastern edge of the city, with Ukrainian guns targeting Russian positions, it seemed. An apartment block, hit once already, was still smoking after another rocket tore through all four floors. Soldiers anxiously milled on the street outside, inspecting the damage. Military vehicles whizzed along the streets. Slower, walking home with food in a trolley with loud and squeaky wheels, was pensioner Maria, her eyes covered by large sunglasses. ""With God you have no fear. And on your own land you cannot feel fear either,"" Maria said. More blast noises broke through the shrill squeak of her rusty wheels.",14,4.1727131326103954,5.416185890265852,-1.2434727576554563,15
2022-09-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/europe/ukraine-russia-winter-lister-cotovio-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html,Winter is fast approaching in Ukraine. Here's what comes next for the conflict,"Until a few weeks ago, it looked as though the conflict in Ukraine would head into the bitter winter months frozen in place -- with neither side making appreciable progress. That prognosis has changed with the sudden and successful Ukrainian offensive through most of occupied Kharkiv, which has galvanized Ukraine's Western backers as much as it has led to recriminations in Moscow. The Russian military must now ask itself what sort of force, and where exactly they are deployed, can regain the initiative after Ukraine captured more territory in one week than Russian forces had in five months. There are important political dynamics involved too. The Kremlin faces tough choices: whether to declare a general mobilization to reinvigorate its increasingly ragged units in Ukraine and how to manage a budget deficit -- even though it's sitting on historically high foreign reserves. Far beyond the theater of war, Russia must choose how far to weaponize its influence over Europe's gas supply, as governments prepare to spend big to mitigate the effects of exceptionally tight supply. Another potential dilemma: the first signs that Chinese support for the Russian invasion, never whole-hearted, may be waning. A changing battlefield Ukraine's stunning counter-offensive across Kharkiv, combined with more attritional advances in the south, have presented the Kremlin and Russia's much criticized Defense Ministry with a range of bad options. As winter approaches, they must choose which front to prioritize, and whether to double down on efforts to fulfill Putin's stated objective: the seizure of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The Russians currently hold about 20% of Ukrainian land, including Crimea and parts of the south. Taking Donetsk is a taller order now for the Russians. Seven months of war have shown the shortcomings in Russian logistics, which will get no easier in wetter, colder weather. In a matter of days, Russia lost one of three axes of attack in Donetsk; no progress has been made on the other two since the end of June. At the same time, Russian defenses in Kherson are under growing pressure despite being reinforced, thanks to Ukraine's success in cutting off resupply across the River Dnipro and in targeting command posts and ammunition depots. The Russian military does not have a wealth of fresh units to inject into the conflict. The recently stood-up 3rd Army Corps largely comprises volunteer battalions recruited across the Russian regions. Other battalion tactical groups have been reconstituted after suffering heavy losses. There are persistent reports of discipline fraying among Russian units. The disorderly retreat in Kharkiv, with vast amounts of military hardware abandoned, is testament to that -- and to chronic command problems that will not be remedied overnight. Obviously, Ukraine has also lost thousands of soldiers, including many from its best units in Donbas. And a NATO military official told CNN that while the sweep across Ukraine had been a major boost for morale, ""I can't imagine the same thing happening twice."" And Russia's artillery and rocket forces still vastly outnumber those of Ukraine. But it's been unable to leverage this superiority into gains on the ground. Some 40% of Donetsk remains under Ukrainian control. President Vladimir Putin acknowledged this on Friday -- saying that the offensive operation in the Donbas ""goes at a slow pace, but it keeps going. Gradually, gradually, the Russian army occupies new territories."" And despite calls in Moscow for a general mobilization, this still seems unlikely. Putin said: ""We are fighting with only part of the Russian army, the part that's on contract ...Therefore, we are not in a hurry on this part."" A Ukrainian victory? Some observers have begun to ask whether a Ukrainian victory is conceivable. That depends on how victory is defined. It is President Zelensky's stated intention to recover all occupied territories as well as Crimea. General David Petraeus, former CIA Director and commander of US military forces in Iraq, said he expected Ukraine to retake territory seized by the Russians since February, and ""it's even conceivable they could retake Crimea and the Donbas,"" aided by growing resistance in occupied areas. But that would take time and involve tough fighting, Petraeus told CNN. If that were Ukraine's goal, its supply lines would be stretched and its better units spread thin. In turn, Ukrainian forces would be vulnerable to counter-attacks. Ultimately, Ukraine's battlefield success will depend on a continuing and expanded supply of Western hardware. Meetings in the next few weeks will determine what's in that pipeline, but inventories in several countries are dwindling. US officials are also wary that Ukraine might overplay its hand. The US is still exceptionally cautious about sending Ukraine weapons that have a range of more than 80 kilometers (nearly 50 miles) and could therefore strike deep inside Russia. It has so far resisted Ukrainian requests for long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) that have a range of up to 300 kilometers. Some Western officials fear humiliation for the Kremlin might provoke an unpredictable reaction, even including tactical nuclear weapons. A former NATO deputy secretary-general, Rose Gottemoeller, told the BBC this week: ""I do worry about that kind of scenario at the moment... The goal would be to try to get the Ukrainians in their terror to capitulate."" Back in February, on the eve of the invasion, Putin warned that any country standing in Russia's way would face ""consequences such as they have never seen in their history."" But Olga Olika, director of the Europe and Central Asia Program at the International Crisis Group, believes the Kremlin would not countenance such an escalation because ""detonating weapons of mass destruction would provoke international retaliation, including, quite possibly, direct military involvement from NATO."" US President Joe Biden appeared to confirm this in a ""60 Minutes"" interview -- a clip of which aired on CBS Evening News on Friday. He warned Putin against escalating the fighting further in Ukraine, saying that there will be consequences if the Kremlin used chemical or nuclear weapons in the fighting. ""Don't. Don't. Don't. It would change the face of war unlike anything since World War II,"" Biden said. Asked by Scott Pelley what the US response would be if Russia used a chemical or nuclear weapon, Biden said it would be ""consequential."" Other analysts point out that the use of tactical nuclear weapons would hav​e limited military benefits, and that the military might even defy an order from Putin for their use. ""It is hard to imagine that even nuclear strikes would allow Russia to break Ukraine's will to resist,"" said General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's Armed Forces commander in chief. Russia still has an intimidating arsenal of ballistic and other missiles that could be used not to gain territory but to inflict catastrophic damage on Ukraine's infrastructure: power, water and communications. On Russian state television, pundits have argued for Ukraine's power and water infrastructure to be destroyed. And there have been signs of Russian missile forces doing just that -- with attacks on power supplies in Kharkiv and hydraulic gates on a reservoir in Kryviy Rih in recent days. Nevertheless, the trajectory of the war looks different heading into the final months of a year that began with few hopes Ukraine could resist the Russian behemoth. That in itself may stiffen the backbone of European support -- and spur the continuing pipeline of military aid -- despite an expensive winter of discontent over heating and fuel prices. The gas gambit It's long been evident that part of the Kremlin's strategy is to knee-cap European resolve in supporting Ukraine by plunging it into an energy crisis, literally turning off the gas taps. At a forum in Vladivostok earlier this month, Putin said: ""We will not supply anything at all if it is contrary to our interests. No gas, no oil, no coal, no fuel oil, nothing."" Amid setbacks on the battlefield, Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay write in Foreign Affairs that ""Putin's best hope — perhaps his only hope — is that Western support for Ukraine will crumble as the costs of war, including energy shortages and rising prices, begin to hit home in Europe."" Natural gas prices in Europe are 10 times higher than a year ago, earning Russia about $1 billion a day in the first three months of the conflict from energy exports. And the sanctions regime against Russia will only have significant impact in the longer-term, because the Russian economy is so self-contained. But the coming winter will be the acid test of Moscow's energy squeeze. Rather than looking for compromise, European governments have concluded that concessions would only embolden the Kremlin. They are set on heavy spending to protect consumers and a longer-term strategy to reduce dependence on Russian energy. After scouring the world for alternative suppliers, they have built up reserves (in France's case to more than 90% of capacity). Even though wholesale gas prices are still numbingly high, they have fallen by about one-third in the last three weeks. Some analysts think they will further do so, reducing the cost of subsidies being introduced by European governments already strapped for cash. There are also signs that Russia's windfall from sky-high oil and gas prices may have peaked. The International Energy Agency forecasts that Russian oil production will be 17% lower by next February compared to pre-war output, once the full force of EU sanctions are felt. Daalder and Lindsay believe Ukraine's allies have set their course. ""Many skeptics in the West believe democracies will buckle in the face of hardship,"" they wrote. ""But such voices underestimate the West's staying power."" No doves of peace The signals from both sides indicate they are digging in for a long winter, rather than exploring prospects for a settlement. ""Russia will do everything to end the conflict in Ukraine as quickly as possible, but Kyiv refuses to negotiate,"" Putin said at a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. In the meantime, Russia's goal was still ""the liberation of Donbas"" and there was ""no hurry."" But the Russian leader also acknowledged the ""concerns"" that both India and China have about the conflict. Chinese leader Xi Jinping, in his first meeting with Putin since before the invasion, notably did not refer to Ukraine by name, according to a read-out from Beijing. Some observers believe Beijing is subtly adopting an arm's length approach to the Russian quagmire in Ukraine. How that may play into Putin's calculations is as yet unknown. For their part, the Ukrainians have been consistent about not negotiating with Moscow unless and until all occupied territor",14,4.059060032741992,4.636779189545928,-0.5777191568039362,16
2022-09-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/europe/ukraine-izium-mass-burial-site-intl-hnk/index.html,"Some bodies found at mass burial site in Izium show 'signs of torture,' Ukraine says","Even the heavy rainfall couldn't erase the smell of death in the pine forest in Izium on Friday afternoon, as Ukrainian investigators worked their way through a mass burial site found in the eastern Ukrainian city after its recapture from Russian forces. Ukraine's Defense Ministry said at least 440 ""unmarked"" graves were found in the city in recent days. The country's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that some of the bodies found in Izium showed ""signs of torture,"" blaming Russia for what he called ""cruelty and terrorism."" Zelensky posted a photograph of the ongoing exhumation of bodies at a mass burial site near the city of Izium. In a text accompanying the photograph on his Telegram channel, Zelensky wrote: ""The whole world should see this. A world in which there should be no cruelty and terrorism. But all this is there. And its name is Russia."" Izium was subject to intense Russian artillery attacks in April. The city, which sits near the border between the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, became an important hub for the invading military during five months of occupation. Ukrainian forces took back control of the city on Saturday, delivering a strategic blow to Russia's military assault in the east. When CNN arrived to the mass burial site on Friday afternoon, officials were transporting body bags, including one that appeared to be holding something very small, into a refrigerated truck. Most graves at the burial site are individual graves, with wooden crosses placed at the head of the dirt mounds. Some with names and numbers handwritten on them. One had a number as high as 398. Another with the name of an 82-year-old man. One official at the site told CNN that investigations would have to determine when these people died. Further down in the forest lies what appeared to be a former military position, with tank positions dug deep into the ground. A policeman at the scene told CNN that the spot is a mass grave where 17 bodies were found. ""Here are civilian bodies and military ones further along,"" Igor Garmash, an investigator at the scene said of the specific part of the site he was examining, pointing to a location nearby. ""Over 20 bodies have been examined and sent for further investigation,"" he told CNN. Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications said on Thursday that some of the graves discovered at Izium were ""fresh,"" and that the corpses buried there were ""mostly civilians."" Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian Parliament's Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a video statement from the site that ""there is a whole family right next to me... This is a young family... The father was born in 1988, the wife was born in 1991, their little daughter was born in 2016."" He said local people told the investigators that the family had died in a Russian airstrike. ""Also we saw here a mass burial of servicemen of the Ukrainian army. The way they were buried -- you will see evidence that their hands were tied, they were killed at close range,"" Lubinets said. An Izium resident living across the street from the mass burial site told CNN the Russians first hit a nearby city graveyard with an airstrike and then moved in. ""They brought their special machines. They dug some trenches for their vehicles. We only heard how they were destroying the forest,"" Nadezhda Kalinichenko told CNN. She said she tried not to go out during the time the city was under the Russian occupation because she was too scared. ""When they left, I don't know if there was fighting or not. We just heard a lot of heavy trucks one night a week ago,"" she said. 'Bloody brutal terror' Zelensky said during his address on Thursday that Russia must be held accountable for deaths there, and in other cities where large numbers of bodies had been found. ""Bucha, Mariupol and now, unfortunately, Izium... Russia leaves death everywhere. And must be responsible for it. The world must hold Russia to real responsibility for this war. We will do everything for this,"" he added. The Governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said that ""the scale of the crimes committed by the invaders in Izium is enormous. This is bloody brutal terror."" Syniehubov said that ""450 bodies of civilians with traces of violent death and torture were buried in a forest belt. It is difficult to imagine something like this in the 21st century, but now it is a tragic reality in Izium."" Syniehubov said that among the bodies exhumed on Friday ""99 percent showed signs of violent death."" ""There are several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person is buried with a rope around his neck. Obviously, these people were tortured and executed. There are also children among the buried,"" he said. Meanwhile, Oleh Kotenko, Ukraine's commissioner for missing persons, said in a Telegram post that search operations for the remains of ""fallen heroes"" were proceeding cautiously throughout the region. ""The biggest problem is that some areas are still mined. Despite this, we continue to work, because we have to return each hero home so that the families can honor the memory of the soldiers who died for Ukraine in a dignified manner as soon as possible,"" Kotenko said. Zelensky visited Izium on Wednesday and told journalists he was ""shocked"" by the number of ""destroyed buildings"" and ""killed people"" left in the wake of the Russian occupation. In his nightly address on Friday, Zelensky said exhumation of the bodies at the mass burial site was continuing and it was still ""too early to speak about the total number of people buried there."" He added that investigations were taking place in all areas of the country that had been recaptured from Russian forces and that a number of civilians, including foreigners, who had been held captive in occupied cities and towns had been found alive. Among the foreigners rescued were seven students from Sri Lanka, he said. They were studying in Kupyansk Medical College but were captured by Russian soldiers back in March and held in a basement. ""Only now, after the liberation of Kharkiv region, these people were rescued and are being provided proper medical care,"" Zelensky said. A United Nations source has told CNN that a team from the UN's human rights monitoring agency -- the OCHR -- would be going to Izium and areas around it as soon as possible. The War Crimes investigation team may follow after that, the source said. Their specific destination remains unclear at this time. Moscow was using Izium as a launching pad for attacks southward into the Donetsk region and Kupyansk, some 48 kilometers (30 miles) to the north of Izium, and as a rail hub to resupply its forces. Zelensky also thanked foreign governments for sending investigators and prosecutors to investigate alleged human rights abuses by occupying forces in Ukraine, adding that all occupied areas would eventually return. Ukrainian forces have been on a sustained military offensive, particularly in the country's northeast and southern regions. Zelensky said on Tuesday that 8,000 square kilometers (3,088 square miles) of territory had now been liberated by Ukrainian forces so far this month, with roughly half the area still undergoing ""stabilization"" measures.",13,5.8184172363273925,4.897714665906548,0.9207025704208442,15
2022-09-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/politics/us-ukraine-aid-weapons/index.html,"US sees the aid its given Ukraine as effective, likely won't provide longer-range systems for now","The Biden administration is unlikely to significantly change its approach to helping Ukraine fight Russia, sources tell CNN, and is rebuffing some Ukrainian weapons requests for now -- even as Ukrainian forces have made sweeping gains and recaptured thousands of miles of territory from Russia in recent days. US officials broadly view Ukraine's recent momentum as evidence that the types of weapons and intelligence that the West has been providing to Ukraine in recent months has been effective. And some caution that it's too early to call Ukraine's rapid progress in recent days a turning point in the war, warning that Russia is far from a spent force militarily. Officials do not believe the battlefield landscape has changed enough to warrant a dramatic strategy shift in the short term despite recent Ukrainian requests to lawmakers and the Pentagon for long-range missile systems and tanks, which they assert can help them sustain the push for longer and keep the territory they have regained. But for now, at least, the US is still not inclined to provide Ukrainian forces with the long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, also known as ATACMS, that they have been requesting for months, officials told CNN. ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers, or around 185 miles. The administration still believes providing those systems could be escalatory because they could be used to fire into Russia itself. Currently, the maximum range of US-provided weapons to Ukraine is around 49 miles. ""It's our assessment that they don't currently require ATACMS to service targets that are directly relevant to the current fight,"" Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters in late-August. Last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin intimated the US position hasn't shifted. ""The HIMARS, using the GMLRS rockets, have been extraordinary in terms of enabling the Ukrainians to service the targets that they need to service inside of Ukraine,"" Austin said in Prague on Friday, making no mention of ATACMS. Since the beginning of the conflict in February, the Biden administration has taken an incremental approach to providing arms to Ukraine -- in some cases, later agreeing to send weapons that earlier in the conflict would have been deemed far too escalatory. Its calculus has largely been based on avoiding systems that might be seen by Putin as too provocative, although those lines have moved over time and been criticized by some former officials as arbitrary. Some US military officials also acknowledged that systems currently considered too escalatory -- like F-16 jets, for example -- might eventually be provided to Ukraine. But those sources cautioned that such a decision is likely far in the future and isn't linked to Ukraine's recent, but nascent, successes. And there are no indications that such discussions are underway now. ""Ukraine has made some progress, but there's still a very tough fight, and a tough fight ahead, so I think we also need to keep that in mind,"" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Tuesday. ""I think it is reasonable over time to continue, as we have, that dialogue to hear what their needs are, to work with the international community."" US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby echoed that, telling reporters that the US would likely announce additional military assistance to Ukraine in the coming days but declined to outline that aid in detail. Another defense official told CNN on Tuesday that the longer-range equipment is likely still off the table for now because Ukraine is ""still in the sweet spot on HIMARS,"" or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems that the US and some of its allies provided to Ukraine over the summer. The munitions for those systems, provided by the US, are capable of using GPS-guidance to strike a target with precision some 40 miles away. Ukrainian forces have received ""thousands"" of GMLRS rounds, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said last week, and used them to strike Russian ammo depots, logistical hubs and command posts. Still, some lawmakers disagree with the administration's cautious approach. Asked whether he believes the US should send the ATACMS, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida told CNN, ""I think we should send them anything they need to reclaim their territory, to the extent that we have it available, and it is reasonable."" ""I think the concern some would say is that the longer-range missiles could target deep inside of Russia and trigger a broader conflict. I'm not sure I'm as troubled by that,"" Rubio added. US officials cautious on state of the war The US has also been careful not to call the rapid Ukrainian territorial gains a turning point in the war, or a critical moment that will decide the outcome for good. ""It's more important than ever that we don't appear to be spiking the ball,"" a defense official said. The Russians still have a tremendous amount of firepower, manpower and equipment in the fight in Ukraine, and the victories this month of the Ukrainian military have not sealed the outcome of the war. In military terms, Russia still has ""mass,"" even if it has been unable to bring that to bear at a critical time and place to shape the outcome of a particular fight. Still, the Ukrainian counteroffensive -- planned with US assistance -- does appear to have been ""expertly executed,"" the official said. One thing that has changed in the last several months is the Ukrainians' willingness to share intelligence with the US, allowing American officials to better help the Ukrainians shape their battlefield operations. ""There's a lot more trust now than there was at the beginning of the war,"" said one Ukrainian source close to President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""And the Ukrainians recognize that the more they share, the more they are likely to get in return."" A US military source added that there has been ""decent communication at varying levels about what's being planned on the political side and the military side. There's pretty good military transparency."" In Kherson, where Ukraine telegraphed its intentions for months before the counteroffensive began, Russia had time to prepare, digging in to protect the territory around one of the first cities they occupied early in the war. Ukraine's advances there have been incremental and deliberate, one official said, and there is no rapid advance through collapsing Russian lines. Some analysts have described the Kherson offensive as a ""fixing"" operation designed to keep Russian troops engaged away from the fight in Kharkiv. In Kharkiv, however, the attack caught the Russians by surprise and without any well-prepared defenses, allowing the Ukrainian military to rapidly reclaim thousands of square miles of territory. Russia has so far failed to meaningfully stop the counteroffensive in Ukraine's south or east as the problems they had early in the war -- supply line issues, logistical problems, and a lack of effective command and control -- still plague the Russian military, officials said. Russia proved unable to hold the territory it had seized, partially because of the high cost imposed on them by Ukrainian defenders. The US is less concerned about Ukraine's ability to hold reclaimed territory, officials said, even in the east, where Ukrainian forces have moved more than 60 kilometers within days in some cases. Ukraine's supply lines are internal, whereas Russia's were outside its own borders. In addition, Ukraine's forces will get a significant boost to morale and will from the recent victories, one official said, while Russia's depleted forces will feel the opposite. It's ""not a real concern of [Ukraine] overstretching supply lines,"" an official said. Despite Russian claims of destroying the US-provided HIMARS, all of the 16 systems remain accounted for and the ""overwhelming majority"" of M777 howitzers also remain in operation, officials said.",14,3.5399241219948947,6.802508454950802,-3.262584332955907,12

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that Russia targeted the Karachunivske Reservoir, adding that it had no military value and the strikes would only impact local civilians. The strikes destroyed a water pumping station and flooded the embankments, which are just a few meters from residential buildings, according to Ukrainian legislator Inna Sovsun. Water spilled into the Inhulets River -- the right tributary of the Dnipro River in southeastern Ukraine. Residents in districts across Kryvyi Rih were asked to evacuate their homes on Thursday to avoid flood-risk. Emergency services and rescuers worked overnight and into Thursday, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk region's civil military administration said in a Telegram post. Valentyn Reznichenko said teams had done an ""incredible job."" Water levels in the Inhulets River have now dropped by 50 centimeters (20 inches) after rising suddenly Wednesday, Andrii Kurach, head of the State Emergency Service of the Dnipropetrovsk region, said Thursday. Flood levels in the local area have since receded, work to repair the damage was 50% complete and water supplies were being restored, a regional official said Thursday. ""The Karachunivske Reservoir is huge -- there was a threat of a great flood. But thanks to coordinated actions, it was averted,"" said Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the Kryvyi Rih civil military administration. Hours after the attack, another Russian cruise missile hit the Kryvyi Rih area on Thursday, Vilkul added. 'Weaklings waging war on civilians' Following the attack, Zelensky delivered a pointed message to Moscow in which he referred to the Russian military as ""weaklings."" ""Your missile attacks today, Russian missiles targeting Kryvyi Rih, the dam of the Karachunivske Reservoir, the objects that have no military value at all, in fact hitting hundreds of thousands of ordinary civilians, is another reason why Russia will lose. And not just this war, but history itself,"" he said in his nightly address on Wednesday. ""History is written by people, never by savages. Who will you remain in history? All those who launch these missiles. Those who came to our land. Weaklings. You are weaklings waging a war against civilians,"" he added. ""Scoundrels who, having fled the battlefield, are trying to do harm from somewhere far away. You will remain terrorists whom their own grandchildren will be ashamed of."" Moscow's attack on the reservoir comes days after a Russian missile strike hit a power and heating plant in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, leaving many without power. During his visit to the newly liberated Izium on Wednesday, Zelensky said he was ""shocked"" by the levels of destruction left by Russian forces following their months-long occupation of the city in Kharkiv.",17,3.9271674940598578,4.62475568603033,-0.6975881919704721,8
2022-09-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/europe/russia-kharkiv-withdrawal-analysis-npw-intl/index.html,The curtain protecting the dignity of Russia's military has been pulled back,"The tsar suddenly might have no clothes. It has been a startling week on both sides of the Ukraine and Russia border. What's left of the curtain protecting the dignity of Russia's military has been pulled back, and it's definitely not the second mightiest in the world. Russia's withdrawal from around Kharkiv -- a planned ""regrouping"" that some state media didn't even dare mention -- is arguably more significant than its earlier collapse of positions around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. These units had been dug in for months, defending their positions effectively -- as CNN witnessed during weeks spent along the arterial roads north out of Kharkiv -- and were at times literally minutes drive from the Russian border. That Moscow could not sustain a force so achingly close to its own territory speaks volumes about the real state of its supply chain and military. It is almost as if these retreating units ran back to a void, not to the nuclear power that in February expected to overrun its neighbor within 72 hours. Secondly, Russia's units do not appear to have effected a careful and cautious withdrawal. They ran, and left behind both armor and precious remaining supplies of ammunition. Open source intelligence website Oryx estimated that from Wednesday to Sunday, at least 338 fighter jets or tanks or trucks were left behind. Pockets of Russian troops may remain to harass Ukrainian forces in the weeks ahead, but the nature of the frontline has irrevocably changed, as has its size. Kyiv is suddenly fighting a much smaller war now, along a greatly reduced frontline, against an enemy who also appear a lot smaller. Indeed, Russia's army relies now on forced mobilization and prisoners for its depleted ranks. Ukraine has been quite surgical, hitting supply routes to cut off already exhausted units, detecting which were the least prepared and manned. It's been staggeringly effective and speedy. Whether Ukraine's counteroffensive becomes decisive rests on how far its forces are now able to push: Would going for even more territory risk over-stretch? Or is Ukraine facing an enemy that simply has no more fight left in it? No matter how over-hyped Russia's forces became during the chaotic decades of America's war on terror, a military that needs North Korean shells and St Petersburg convicts is at best down to the bare minimum strength needed to protect Russia itself. So what next? Unless we see a remarkable reversal, Russia's bid to take all of Donetsk and Luhansk regions is over. Kherson is still the focus of sustained Ukrainian pressure. And suddenly, a return to the borders Russia stole in 2014 does not seem far-fetched. For months, the received wisdom was that Russia would ""never let that happen."" But now Crimea looks oddly vulnerable -- connected to Russia by the land corridor that runs along the Azov Sea through Mariupol's coastline, and an exposed bridge across the Kerch Strait. What remain of Moscow's over-extended, exhausted, poorly supplied and equipped forces deeper in Ukraine could face the same lethal encircling as did its supply chain around Kharkiv. However far Kyiv pushes now, we've had a sea change in the dynamics of European security. Russia is no longer a peer to NATO. Last week, Russia wasn't even the peer of its NATO-armed neighbor -- a power mostly in agriculture and IT as recently as December -- that it has been slowly tormenting for eight years. The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense said on Monday that elements of Russia's First Guards Tank Army -- an elite unit intended to defend Moscow from any NATO attack -- had been part of the chaotic Kharkiv withdrawal. They ran. NATO member states' defense budgets have been slowly edging toward the suggested 2% for years. But will those billions really be needed to face an army that needed shells from Pyongyang after just six months in Ukraine? It would also be a mistake to misinterpret the silence inside Russia -- a few critical analysts, politicians and talk shows aside -- as a sign of a brooding, residual strength that's about to be unleashed. This is not a system capable of looking at itself in the mirror. The Kremlin remains quiet on these issues because it cannot face the chasm between its ambitions and rhetoric, and the scruffy, hungry mercenaries it appears to have left stranded around Kharkiv. The fact they do not speak of their errors amplifies them. The Ferris wheel that President Vladimir Putin opened in Moscow at the weekend does not become invisible when it breaks down and cannot turn. The same can be said of the monolithic and uncompromising strength Putin tries to project: when it breaks down, it is not in private. The most flagrant foreign policy errors of the last centuries have been born of hubris, but Europe faces a series of stark choices now. Do they continue to push until Russia requests a peace that leaves its neighbors safe and the energy pipelines open again? Or do they retain the old flawed logic that a humiliated, wounded bear is even more dangerous? Would a possible successor to Putin -- not that we know of one -- seek a detente with Europe and prioritize the Russian economy, or prove their worth in another foolhardy, hardline act of brutish militarism? This is also a key moment for non-proliferation and nuclear might in the post-Cold War era. What does a nuclear power do when it is vulnerable and lacking in convincing conventional might? Russia faces no existential threat now: Its borders are intact, and its military only hampered by a savage misadventure of choice. But it appears close to the limits of its conventional capabilities. It would be a telling confirmation of the theory of mutually assured destruction that has always governed the nuclear-arms age, if weapons that could end the world as we know it remain off the table. It would also add to the possibility, raised again by the full-throated support of Ukraine by the West, that the horrors of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine have not irreparably damaged the West's moral and strategic compass, and it is still not naive to hope to see those values in action.",14,4.24450923896594,3.4529225956933893,0.7915866432725509,17

Each of you did an incredible job,” Reznichenko said in a Telegram post Thursday. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian missile strikes had targeted and hit the dam of the Karachunivske Reservoir in Kryvyi Rih. The strikes destroyed a water pumping station and flooded the embankments, which are just a few meters from residential buildings, according to Ukrainian legislator Inna Sovsun. Residents in districts across Kryvyi Rih – the largest city in central Ukraine – were asked to evacuate their homes Thursday due to the risk of floods. Residents in districts across Kryvyi Rih were asked to evacuate their homes on Thursday, after Russian missile strikes destroyed a water pumping station, causing the Inhulets River to break through a dam. “Dear residents of Kryvyi Rih, today the Russians committed another terrorist act. Eight cruise missiles hit a very large hydrotechnical structure in Kryvyi Rih. The effort is to simply wash away part of our city with water,” the head of the city’s civil military administration Oleksander Vilkul said in a Telegram post. “We are monitoring the situation…all services are involved; everyone is on the ground. But the water level in the Inhulets River has risen. In order to avoid unnecessary risks, I am asking people [to evacuate],” Vilkul added, urging residents in almost two dozen districts to wait for communal buses to take them out of at-risk areas. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian missile strikes had targeted and hit the dam of the Karachunivske Reservoir in Kryvyi Rih. The strikes destroyed a water pumping station and flooded the embankments, which are just a few meters from residential buildings, according to Ukrainian legislator Inna Sovsun. Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, where he will meet face to face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported Thursday. The two leaders will discuss Ukraine and Taiwan, according to Putin’s foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov. ##SCO Summit## The Russian and Chinese navies are conducting joint patrols in the Pacific Ocean ahead of a face-to-face meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a regional summit in southeastern Uzbekistan. “The crews are practicing joint tactical manoeuvring and organization of communication between the ships, conducting a series of exercises with practical artillery firing, and facilitating deck helicopter flights,” Russia’s Ministry of Defense said in a statement. “The objectives of the patrols are to strengthen naval cooperation between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China (PRC), to maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, to monitor maritime waters, and to protect maritime economic activities of the Russian Federation and the PRC,” it added. The drills came ahead of a meeting between Putin and Xi at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Samarkand, Uzbekistan on Thursday, where the two will discuss Ukraine and Taiwan, according to Putin’s foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov. Russia and China have an ongoing military partnership and have conducted a series of joint drills, the highest profile of which was ""Vostok 2018,"" a simulated battle in which a Russian-Chinese coalition fought a fictional enemy. ##SCO Summit## The last time Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin sat down face to face, they declared triumphantly the arrival of a ""new era"" in international relations. Amid a Western diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics and a looming crisis in Ukraine, the world's two most powerful autocrats shared their vision for a new world order: it would better accommodate their nations' interests, and no longer be dominated by the West. In a 5,000-word joint statement, the two leaders declared a friendship with ""no limits"" and spelled out their shared grievances toward the United States and its allies. ""The world is going through momentous changes,"" their joint statement said, noting the ""transformation of the global governance architecture and world order."" More than 200 days later, Xi and Putin are to meet again at a regional summit in the city of Samarkand in southeastern Uzbekistan. Much has changed, but not necessarily in ways China or Russia could have predicted. Three weeks after meeting Xi in Beijing -- and just days after the Winter Olympics ended, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He had expected a quick victory, but seven months in, Russia is far from winning. Its forces are exhausted, demoralized, and fleeing territories they have occupied for months. And that is making China nervous. Having grown ever closer to Moscow under Xi, Beijing has a direct stake in the war's outcome. A defeated Russia will strengthen the West and become a less useful and reliable asset in China's great power rivalry with the US. A weakened Moscow might also be less of a distraction for the US, thereby enabling Washington to focus more squarely on Beijing. Xi has a fine line to tread. If he leans too much into helping Russia, he risks exposing China to Western sanctions and diplomatic blowback that would harm its own interests. The backlash would also come at a sensitive time for Xi, who is only weeks away from seeking a norm-breaking third term at the 20th Party Congress.

Not just the war, but in the history books,” Zelensky said, adding that the reservoir has no military value and that the strikes will only impact local civilians. The strikes destroyed the water pumping station and flooded the embankments, which are just a few meters from residential buildings, according to a tweet from Ukrainian Member of Parliament Inna Sovsun. Authorities are closely monitoring the water level and say the situation is under control, the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential administration, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, posted on Telegram. In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops have recovered 110 kilometers (70 miles) of formerly occupied territory around the Kharkiv region over the past five days. He said evidence was being gathered in the previously occupied areas for the “murders and kidnappings, by the occupiers, just as [happened] in Bucha and in the occupied territory of Chernihiv Oblast.” The Ukrainian President then switched into Russian to address the Russian coalition troops, admonishing them for today’s Russian missile strike at the Karachunovsky reservoir dam, which serves the civilian population and “has no military value whatsoever.” History is written by the people and not the monster, never. What will be written about you in the history books?,” Zelensky continued, imploring Russian coalition troops to surrender and gave his guarantee that “they won’t be treated like cannon fodder in an obvious lost cause of a war for Russia.” Zelensky also said 100 million euros ($99.6 million) were awarded by the European Commission for the reconstruction of 74 schools in Ukraine. He concluded by thanking Ursula von der Leyen for her upcoming visit planned for Thursday morning. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was involved in a minor car crash in Kyiv on Wednesday, according to a statement from his press secretary. The president was examined by a doctor and did not have any serious injuries, the statement said. “In Kyiv, a car collided with the car of the President of Ukraine and escort vehicles. Medics accompanying the head of the state provided the driver of the car with emergency aid and transferred him to an ambulance,” the statement read. “The president was examined by a doctor, no serious injuries were found. The law enforcement officers will find out all the circumstances of the accident."" UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Wednesday he feels a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine isn't close. “We are far away from the end of the war,"" he told reporters following a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""A ceasefire is not in sight,” he said, adding, ""I would be lying if I said it would happen.” The diplomat said he discussed a variety of issues with Putin including the grain deal and the possibility of Russian exports, but cautioned there are obstacles to the export of Russian food and fertilizers. “We are risking the lack of food in the world later this year."" The two also discussed prisoners of war and Guterres quoted Putin as saying there would be no obstacles from Russia with regards to the panel conducting a fact-finding mission into last month’s prison attack in the Russian-occupied region of Eastern Ukraine. Dozens were killed. Guterres said he also spoke with Putin about Ukraine’s nuclear plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited newly liberated Izium in the northeastern region of Kharkiv on Wednesday, five days after the country's forces recaptured the city. Photographs on the Facebook page of an army unit showed Zelensky at a ceremony in the main square to raise the Ukrainian flag over the city's administrative building. Hanna Maliar, the Deputy Minister of Defense, was also present. ""Earlier, when we looked up, we always looked for the blue sky. Today, when we look up, we are looking for only one thing -- the flag of Ukraine,"" Zelensky said in a post on the presidential Telegram channel. ""Our blue-yellow flag is already flying in the de-occupied Izium. And it will be so in every Ukrainian city and village. We are moving in only one direction -- forward and towards victory."" ""I want to thank you for saving our people, our hearts, children and future,"" Zelensky said, according to a statement released on the presidential website. ""It has been extremely difficult for you in recent months. Therefore, I ask you to take care of yourselves, because you are the most valuable asset we have,"" he said. ""It may be possible to temporarily occupy the territories of our state. But it is definitely impossible to occupy our people, the Ukrainian people,"" he said. There was a minute's silence at the ceremony to remember those who had been lost during military operations. Ukrainian forces took back control of Izium on Saturday, marking a huge strategic blow to Russia's military assault in the east. Izium, which sits near the border between the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, was under Russian occupation for over five months and became an important hub for the invading military. Moscow was using Izium as a launching pad for attacks southward into the Donetsk region and Kupyansk, some 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the north of Izium, as a rail hub to resupply its forces. Russia's collapse in northeastern Ukraine sparked fury from Putin loyalists, who condemned the Kremlin's abandonment of Kharkiv in a rare display of stinging criticism.

2022-09-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/europe/ukraine-advance-russia-war-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,The rot runs deep in the Russian war machine. Ukraine is exposing it for all to see,"For Russia, the numbers are catastrophic. From Wednesday to Sunday, Vladimir Putin's military forces saw at least 338 pieces of important military hardware -- from fighter jets to tanks to trucks -- destroyed, damaged or captured, according to numbers from the open source intelligence website Oryx, as Ukraine's forces have bolted through Russian-held territory in an offensive that has stunned the Russians in its speed and breadth. Ukraine's top military commander claimed on Sunday that more than 3,000 square kilometers (1,158 square miles) of territory had been retaken by his country's forces since the beginning of September. And for more perspective, just ""since Wednesday, Ukraine has recaptured territory at least twice the size of Greater London,"" the British Defense Ministry said Monday. Ukrainian reports say Putin's troops are fleeing east to the Russian border in whatever transport they can find, even taking cars from the civilian population in the areas they had captured since the start of the war in February. In their wake they leave hundreds of pieces of the Russian war machine, which since Putin's so-called ""special military operation"" commenced, has not come close to living up to its pre-war billing as one of the world's great powers. These Russian losses are the accumulation of a multitude of existing problems that are now colliding head-on with a Ukrainian military that has been patient, methodical and infused with billions of dollars of Western military equipment that Russia cannot match. And without a drastic, and potentially unconventional intervention from Putin, the Ukrainian victories are likely to accelerate, analysts say. Many of Russia's problems -- poor and inflexible leadership, sour troop morale, inadequate logistics and hardware beset by maintenance issues -- have been evident since the beginning stages of the war more than seven months ago. The Russian military's hollow core -- including tanks that were easy prey for Ukrainian ground troops and trucks that didn't have the right tires to traverse Ukraine's landscape -- was quickly exposed by tactics ill-suited to the blitzkrieg Putin had planned. Remember that 64-kilometer (40-mile) convoy that stalled on the way to the capital of Kyiv and was shredded by Ukrainian defenders? As that convoy stalled, reports filtered out that Russian troops had significant morale problems -- some didn't even know they were in Ukraine, or if they did, why they were there. As the fighting intensified, Ukrainian forces targeted Russian leadership, killing generals and colonels who would have been expected to rally the Russian forces. And the Russians certainly needed stronger leadership if accounts of troop hardships are to be believed. Pavel Filatyev, a Russian paratrooper who fought his army's capture of the Ukrainian city of Kherson earlier in the war, told CNN last month that his unit lacked even the basics during that operation. ""Several days after we encircled Kherson many of us did not have any food, water or sleeping sacks,"" he said. ""Because it was very cold at night, we couldn't even sleep. We would find some rubbish, some rags, just to wrap ourselves to keep warm."" And their armaments were substandard, he said. ""All of our weapons are from the times of Afghanistan,"" where Russian forces fought from 1979 to 1989, he said. The impact of Western arms donations Meanwhile, Western arms have flowed into Ukraine, among them powerful advanced artillery systems like the HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. The wheeled HIMARS offer what US manufacturer Lockheed Martin calls ""shoot and scoot capability"" -- they can fire highly accurate rockets at targets about 70 to 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) away and then move quickly to avoid any counterstrike. Ukraine has used them with devastating effect on Russian supply lines, ammunition dumps and command posts. ""Ukraine's armed forces employed HIMARS and other Western systems to attack Russian ground lines of communication in Kharkiv and Kherson Oblasts, setting conditions for the success of this operation,"" the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in a blog post on Sunday. The pounding meted out by Ukrainian deployed HIMARS on Russian supply lines has been relentless, according to Western analysts. ""Ukrainian long-range artillery is now probably hitting crossings of the Dnipro (River) so frequently that Russia cannot carry out repairs to damaged road bridges,"" Britain's Defense Ministry said Monday. Trent Telenko, a former quality control auditor for the US' Defense Contract Management Agency who has studied Russian logistics, said Ukrainian forces used precision rockets fired from the HIMARS batteries to take out key large Russian arms depots near rail lines well back of the front lines. This meant Russia had to use trucks to disperse artillery pieces and ammunition to smaller depots, making it more difficult to distribute, Telenko said. When Ukraine began its lightning offensive, Russia could not bring appropriate firepower to blunt the Ukrainian advance because its artillery was so dispersed, he said. But the HIMARS and other powerful Western artillery systems shouldn't get all the credit, ISW said. They were coupled with Ukrainian feints and ingenuity. Last week Russia redeployed forces to the south to bolster its ranks ahead of a mooted Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson region, according to Ukrainian officials and footage of equipment moving through Crimea. That opened the door for Ukrainian forces farther north. ""Kyiv's long discussion and then an announcement of a counter-offensive operation aimed at Kherson Oblast drew substantial Russian troops away from the sectors on which Ukrainian forces have conducted decisive attacks in the past several days,"" ISW said. Once those Russian forces moved, the Ukrainian military probed for weak points in Russian lines, said Mark Hertling, a CNN analyst and former US Army general. ""What they have been able to do is conduct reconnaissance with a small force to find where to conduct a much larger breakthrough, pushing tanks and artillery through the holes in the Russian front and then getting into the Russian rear areas,"" Hertling said. Supplies for Ukraine to fuel its advance The quick Russian retreat has enabled Ukraine to capture Russian arms, ammunition, fuel and supplies in those rear areas, said Telenko, adding that the addition of trucks and trains to the Ukrainian inventory will allow Kyiv to ""supercharge"" its advances. Analysts have also noted the lack of Russian air support. Richard Hooker Jr., a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, said last month that Ukraine has stitched together a force of older antiaircraft systems already in its inventory with supplies of US and German equipment and ""largely sidelined Russian airpower."" ""Ukraine has been outstandingly successful in denying Russia air supremacy with extremely effective air defense and a strategy of 'air denial,'"" Hooper wrote on the Atlantic Council's ""Ukraine Alert"" blog. And Russian setbacks are just fuel for even more trouble ahead, a spiral of defeats that may be beyond Moscow's ability to stop. Mick Ryan, an adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Australian Army general, terms it ""cascading failure"" in a Twitter post. ""Each battlefield loss and withdrawal leads to further failure,"" he said. As the options dwindle, so will embattled Russian morale. As retreating forces move back, they'll bring stories of their withdrawal with them. It will be all but impossible for the Kremlin to keep those stories from spreading within its forces and even to their relatives back home. The territory Russia captured in Ukraine over seven months, at the cost of tens of thousands of Russian casualties, has been lost in a week. And Russia's generals seemingly have no immediate answer. Even when Putin's forces were advancing, those advances were slow and grinding. And earlier in the war, Ukraine's defenders never fled the way Russian troops have in the past week. ""The already limited trust deployed troops have in Russia's senior military leadership is likely to deteriorate further,"" the British Defense Ministry said on Monday. The ministry's report said the Ukrainian attacks had made it difficult for Russia to move replacement troops to the front lines. Where does Moscow find replacements? The big question is whether Russia has fresh trained troops to move forward. In July, CNN reported that the call had gone out across Russia for more than 30,000 volunteers to join the war effort in Ukraine. The lure was big cash bonuses and no experience was necessary. But Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at ISW, said those new recruits would likely be of little help on the battlefield as there would not be enough time to train them. For instance, training a tank crew can take several months at a minimum and sometimes more than a year, experts say. ""Short-term training is unlikely to turn volunteers with no prior experience into effective soldiers in any unit,"" Stepanenko said. And those 300-plus Russian pieces of hardware left destroyed, damaged or abandoned on the battlefield over the past several days won't be easy to replace either. Russian industry has been hamstrung by Western sanctions. Russian arms depots have already been raided to replace earlier losses. And while large numbers of arms may remain in those depots, they are likely old and in need of repair or refurbishment, said Jakub Janovsky, a military analyst who contributes to the Oryx blog. ""In practice replacements are often much older vehicles -- likely to suffer from reliability problems and with lower effectiveness in combat,"" he said. Moscow retains manufacturing capacity, but lacks the best components for what it might make, Janovsky said. ""Due to sanctions they might have to replace sensors and electronics with inferior alternatives -- and the amount they can produce in the near term is a fraction of what they are losing. Those material losses ... are not sustainable,"" he said. So advantage Ukraine, at least in the near term. But Ryan, the former Australian general, remains cautious. ""It is too early to speak in overly triumphant terms. The Russians still have the capacity to respond. The south & east are still occupied by the Russians. The Ukrainians have won a significant victory, but there is still a war to be won,"" he tweeted.",14,4.245270650852643,2.3973759868806606,1.8478946639719829,21
2022-09-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/europe/ukraine-izium-recaptured-intl-cmd/index.html,'We prayed to be liberated': Inside a city recaptured by Ukraine after months of Russian occupation,"Burned-out tanks and trucks emblazoned with Russia's signature 'Z' symbol lie at the side of the road, gutted and red with new rust. A collapsed bridge is covered in signs warning of landmines. Further along, the wreckage of a car is left alongside a destroyed petrol station surrounded by the debris of shelling. These are the signs of Ukrainian victory and, for now, a Russian rout. As CNN became the first international television crew to enter Izium since the Ukrainians retook it on Saturday, the team encountered a city just waking up to its new reality: that six months of occupation is over. Izium has now been ""liberated,"" along with almost the whole of Kharkiv region, a Ukrainian military source told CNN. The city is a huge strategic loss for the Russian military, which used it as a key base and resupply route for its forces in eastern Ukraine, and shows the speed and scale of Ukraine's lightning-fast counteroffensive in the northeast. Combined with a parallel offensive in the south, Ukraine has taken back a total of 6,000 square kilometers (about 2,300 square miles) of land, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday. Russia said the retreat of its troops from the region was ""tactical,"" in order to focus resources on the Donbas area. In Izium, work is still ongoing to make the city center completely safe. The Ukrainians are seeking to capture a few Russian soldiers still in hiding, and anyone who worked with them during the occupation. The city also remains in a complete information blackout, with no phone or data signal -- a tactic used by the Russians across the occupied territories. From what the CNN team witnessed, local people are relieved to see their city back in Ukrainian hands. Although the streets of Izium were largely quiet, residents would occasionally venture out of their homes and wave at CNN's vehicles or at the passing military trucks, and shake hands with any Ukrainian soldiers they came across. But at the same time, fear of the Russians still grips the city. Most of the residents CNN approached were too scared to speak freely about what had happened there in recent months. One couple in their fifties agreed to talk, using only their first names. They have been celebrating the Ukrainian victory over the city, Valeriy said, calling it a ""balm for the soul."" ""We prayed to God to be liberated without a fight and without blood. And so it happened,"" he said. The distant sound of shelling is a constant reminder that despite the impressive gains in this counteroffensive, the war is not yet won -- and many parts of Ukraine are still within range of Russia's arsenal of heavy weapons. But slowly, the Ukrainians are working to restore Izium and the other recaptured territories to something approaching normal. During CNN's visit, a group of Ukrainian soldiers barreled up triumphantly in a steaming tank. With obvious glee, they quickly hitched it to a Russian self-propelled artillery vehicle, abandoned intact by retreating Russians. The weapon is among the most powerful in Russia's armory and will be repurposed for Ukraine's counteroffensive. When asked if it was a tough fight to retake the city, the tank driver who drove off with the howitzer replied, ""Not really."" The Ukrainians have gained a huge weaponry haul from these battles in the northeast, as many Russian troops sacrificed their vehicles intact in order to escape with their lives. Inside the abandoned Russian command center One of the final showdowns in the battle for Izium, according to the Ukrainian military, took place in a former school which was being used as a Russian troop base. The Russians had surrounded the building with deep trenches, sand bags and armored vehicles. The building has now been gutted, with piles of red bricks and radiators tangled with broken windows and collapsed timber from the roof. Next to the building lies the shell of a red truck on its side, carrying the 'Z' logo of Russian forces. Further down the road is the building that those troops were trying to protect: the Russian command center, hidden in a subterranean bunker beneath a disused factory. Rows of mismatched school desks lined the gloomy basement, with job titles attached on white labels -- including the commanders of air defense, artillery, intelligence, and state security, along with lower-ranking titles such as ""duty officer."" Nearby, the Ukrainian troops are still finding booby traps that were left to protect their lair -- including a trip wire with a grenade attached. Another bleak concrete room opposite the command center served as the sleeping quarters, with old wooden doors placed horizontally on piles of bricks or jerry cans to create makeshift beds. The retreating troops had apparently left in a hurry, with clothes, toothpaste and papers left scattered on the floor and the beds. One Ukrainian soldier showed CNN the green rotary phone that the troops had left behind. ""Russian technology!"" he sneered -- in English. Above ground, the Russians also left piles of ammunition. Along with the loss of weaponry, and the humiliating retreat captured on multiple videos and shared across social media, one military official tells CNN that a large number of Russian prisoners of war have been taken by Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers were victorious in spirit as they drove through the city, waving from their newly acquired tanks and trucks, many of them with the tell-tale 'Z' already painted over. 'Who have we come to liberate here?' Izium resident Valeriy said the locals in the city were angry with the Russians for their behavior. ""Where there were no people, (the Russians) stole everything,"" Valeriy said. ""They lived like pigs. We entered one house -- and pigs live better."" Valeriy said the fighting in Izium began on March 4, when eight Grad rockets landed near their home, which was ""frightening"" but luckily did not hit them directly. Their next-door neighbor's house was destroyed by one of the rockets, but she survived without a scratch. He said the Russian troops who arrived in the city early in the war quickly realized that Russian President Vladimir Putin's justification for the invasion -- to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine -- was a lie. ""A (Russian) artilleryman came and said 'Father, we saved you from the Nazis,'"" Valeriy said. ""And I said to them, 'Show me one.'"" Valeriy said he spoke to the young soldiers in Russian and tried to make them see that they were destroying the once-close relationship Ukrainians and Russians held, particularly in this part of the country which is so close to the border. ""I told them they destroyed a man's house, and he was from the Kursk region (of Russia),"" Valeriy said. ""Everyone here has relatives in Belgorod (in Russia) and other cities."" He said at one point, Russian reconnaissance forces came to him and asked, ""Who have we come to liberate here?"" That confusion and sense of disillusionment from among the Russian ground troops was likely a major factor in their retreat from this region in the past week. But more dangerous to Putin is that the command-and-control system of his army collapsed in Kharkiv province. Those high-ranking officers fled their bunker, while their men abandoned their heavy weapons as they fled. Ukraine's forces will try to keep them on the run and perhaps hope, one day, they return to Moscow with the story of what happened in Kharkiv and demand a reckoning from their leaders.",14,1.371223090127088,3.247873411289409,-1.876650321162321,15
2022-09-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/world/ukraine-wins-could-make-war-more-dangerous-analysis/index.html,Ukraine's battlefield wins encourage the West but could make the war more dangerous,"Ukraine's stunning recapture of vast areas of Russian-held territory is renewing the focus on the most chilling unknown of a war already marked by extreme cruelty -- the depths to which a cornered Vladimir Putin might descend. Huge gains made by Ukrainian forces in recent days are a tribute to the bravery of troops fighting for a nation's survival, an ingenious military strategy and yet more evidence of failures among Russia's once vaunted armed forces. They also represent a victory for Western policy of steadfast support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government. Kyiv's progress validates the US strategy of sending billions of dollars of arms and ammunition to Ukraine's forces in what would previously have been an unheard of modern proxy war in Europe. But they also raise the question of how Putin, facing embarrassments on the battlefield and signs of rare political pressure at home, might react, recalling fears earlier in the war that he could reach for chemical weapons or even a tactical nuclear device as a last resort. ""The Russian regime is in trouble, I believe, and they have got to turn it,"" said retired Army Brig. Gen. Peter Zwack on CNN on Monday evening. ""They are being backed into a corner domestically and not internationally, which makes this all very dangerous,"" he said. Footage of scenes of liberation in Ukraine were regarded with delight in Washington, and as yet another important twist in a war that has often proved unpredictable. ""I think it is a pivotal moment. It really has changed what otherwise was a war of attrition, and clearly given Ukraine an advantage here that gives them momentum at a critical time,"" ex-CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Monday. Ukraine's advance has quickly recaptured 6,000 square kilometers (around 2,300 square miles) in the east and south of the country, according to the Kyiv government. Its troops have been pushing forward in the northeastern region of Kharkiv and have been fighting a smaller offensive in the south. In a potentially important political development, Russia's losses have broken through in Moscow despite the crushing of independent media. Some TV commentators and bloggers have criticized the conduct of the war and the Kremlin admitted that Putin was aware of developments, though insisted the ""special operation"" in Ukraine would succeed. In a show of considerable courage, given Putin's repressive record, deputies in 18 Russian districts called for his resignation, though it would be unwise to over interpret this as a sign of a broad revolt. Still, the White House is highlighting signs of dissent to increase the sense of political pressure on Putin. ""It is very interesting to see, isn't it now, that he's facing some public rebukes not just from opposition figures, but from actual elected officials inside Russia. That's not insignificant, and we'll see where this goes,"" John Kirby, the National Security Council's coordinator for strategic communications, told ABC News on Tuesday. ""We're already starting to see signs that they're going to probably start to crack down on some of these dissident elected officials,"" he said. ""We'll watch this carefully."" Surprising developments in Ukraine will offer new openings to Western governments keen to further increase the pressure on Putin, but they may also require another recalibration of US military aid and other assistance and a reconsideration of the possibilities for Ukraine as it seeks to expel Moscow's troops from all of its territory. The US says it remains committed to giving Ukraine what it needs to carry on the fight against Russia, although that could change after November's midterm elections if Republicans less willing to support a foreign war win control of Congress. One key issue for the US is whether American military aid that first included anti-tank weapons and small arms, then included items like drones and howitzers, may now need to be adjusted again to help Zelensky's armed forces consolidate control over newly captured land and to repel any Russian counter-attacks. ""Now the war enters a new stage where the ability to move forces under fire and exploit weaknesses in Russian lines are of utmost importance,"" said Rafael Loss, coordinator for Pan-European Data Projects at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Western leaders could help Ukraine build on successes and liberate more land with battle tanks and armored vehicles, Loss said. Putin's choice In addition to tactical considerations, Ukraine's romp through previously held Russian territory poses the question of how Putin, who has invested enormous credibility into a war he has framed as a broader conflict against the West, might react to the reversals. Military analysts have said that the breakthroughs by Ukrainian troops over the weekend are the most significant in the war since Russia abandoned its drive to capture the capital Kyiv in the early weeks after the invasion. Basking in the latest Ukrainian victories, Zelensky almost taunted Putin in a Telegram post addressed to Russia Sunday, asking, ""Do you still think that we are 'one nation?' Do you still think that you can scare us, break us, make us make concessions?"" But tempering the euphoria in the West is not just the reality that war can be unpredictable and battlefield gains can be reversed. It's the realization that if Russia is facing heavy loses that are politically unpalatable to the ruthless Russian leader, Ukrainian victories may simply usher the war into a dangerous new phase. The invasion has shown Putin's indifference to human carnage and a willingness previously shown in conflicts in Chechnya and Syria to rain terror on civilians and to raze cities. Tens of thousands of Russian forces have been killed, according to Western intelligence agencies, yet Putin has gone on the record as saying that his country has lost nothing from the invasion. So it's quite possible that Putin will take defeats as a spur to launch withering assaults on liberated districts from the air or with artillery and rocket shells. Another area of possible leverage is the Russian occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest in Europe, which has led international nuclear officials to warn that Moscow is ""playing with fire"" and risks disaster. Given the importance of the conflict to Putin, western strategists also do not rule out the possibility that Russian forces will dig deep into defensive lines for a prolonged war of attrition that could give them time to resupply and regroup. There have long been fears in the West of how Putin would react if it looks like he is losing the war in Ukraine, with concern raised over whether he might escalate to the use of chemical weapons. And the possibility that Russia could even deploy a limited-yield battlefield nuclear weapon in the event its troops are on the run has not been ruled out by Western strategists, even if the US has said there is no sign of Moscow moving its nuclear arsenal so far. Ukraine's top military officer, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, warned of the direct threat of tactical nuclear weapons use by Moscow, Reuters reported last week. Any deployment of weapons of mass destruction would again risk the kind of escalation between Russia -- the world's biggest nuclear power -- and Washington that President Joe Biden has sought to avoid at all costs. A desire to avert such a scenario led him to deter NATO allies in Eastern Europe from sending military jets to Ukraine in the belief that Putin could see it as an unacceptable direct intervention in the war by the alliance. Similar questions might come into play if the US considers sending battle tanks or other such weaponry to Ukraine in a new phase of the war. Struggling to identify Putin's red lines The difficulty for the West has always been trying to calculate where Putin's red lines lie. So far, they've not been crossed. But no one knows if that will change -- and Putin has successfully sowed mystique around himself that makes it impossible to accurately judge how extreme he might get. ""Whether he has lines he would not cross -- it's hard to know that,"" said Bradley Woodworth, a Russia expert and an associate professor of history at the University of New Haven. ""It makes it devilishly difficult, I am sure, to have a coherent policy when things are so fluid."" ""It's scary as hell. How would we know what would be his line for using a tactical nuclear weapons?"" Even short of such a step, there will be increasing scrutiny in the coming days in the US and Western capitals over Putin's next move, especially if the criticism in Moscow grows. One possibility is that Putin could intensify his own efforts to submit Western publics, and the politicians who lead them, to fierce pressure in the winter months by wielding as a weapon Russia's vital role as an energy supplier to Europe. CNN's Natasha Bertrand, Katie Bo Lillis and Phil Mattingly reported Monday that the White House was already worried that Russia's cut-off of oil and gas supplies could cause fissures in the Western alliance. The idea that Putin might respond in a less inflammatory manner -- by seeking a face-saving way out of the war -- is undercut both by Ukrainian determination to drive Russians out of all of their territory after an unprovoked invasion as well as the utter lack of any trust between Moscow and Kyiv, as exemplified by Zelensky's taunts. This, along with the massive political capital Putin has invested in the war, explain the failure so far of building diplomatic exits for the Russian leader. Still, Panetta argued that with continued Ukrainian gains and long-term Western support to enable more progress on the battlefield, Putin could end up in a vulnerable position facing a difficult choice. ""That is the strategy that ultimately will force Putin to decide — whether or not he is going to continue to struggle with what is a war he can't win or whether he is going to try to negotiate some kind of off-ramp,"" he said.",14,3.4800659544825323,1.723579005620956,1.7564869488615764,16

Without you': Zelensky's words for Russia as Ukraine sweeps through northeast,"President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a stark warning to Moscow, declaring that ""history will put everything in its place"" as Ukrainian troops swept through the northeastern region of Kharkiv. In a Telegram post addressed to Russia, Zelensky asked: ""Do you still think that we are 'one nation?' Do you still think that you can scare us, break us, make us make concessions?"" ""You really did not understand anything? Don't understand who we are? What are we for? What are we talking about?,"" said the post, which published Sunday. ""Read my lips: Without gas or without you? Without you. Without light or without you? Without you. Without water or without you? Without you. Without food or without you?

And we will be with gas, light, water and food ... and WITHOUT you!"" Zelensky's message came after a week of stunning transformation on the battlefield of eastern Ukraine, as the country's forces punctured Russian defenses and recaptured more than 3,000 square kilometers (more than 1,100 square miles) of territory. Russia's recent collapse in Kharkiv has been met with stinging criticism from Kremlin loyalists -- and prompted the question of how Moscow will respond to its failure. Zelensky said Russia retaliated on Sunday with missile strikes on infrastructure that caused a power outage in parts of eastern Ukraine, including the regions of Kharkiv and Donetsk. ""Even through the impenetrable darkness, Ukraine and the civilized world clearly see these terrorist acts. Deliberate and cynical missile strikes on critical civilian infrastructure. No military facilities,"" Zelensky said via Telegram. On Monday, Russia launched fresh airstrikes on Kharkiv as the Kremlin sought to downplay Moscow's setback in the region, insisting that it would achieve all the goals of its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. ""The special military operation continues and will continue until the initial goals are achieved,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin was aware of the situation on the frontline. After the success of Ukraine's counteroffensive on Saturday, the Russian Defense Ministry sought to present its retreat as a strategic regrouping. ""The decision was made to regroup Russian troops in the areas of Balakleya and Izium and redirect their efforts in the Donetsk direction,"" it said.",14,2.142118365482314,3.394422672504168,-1.2523043070218538,7
2022-09-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-russia-retreat-intl/index.html,'Everybody was running away.' Ukrainians in Kharkiv villages describe Russia's retreat,"Ukraine had hoped it would mark a turning point. Six months have passed since Russia launched its invasion and Ukraine has since fired back with two counteroffensives -- one in the South and the other in the East -- carefully planned for months and supported by massive US military aid packages. Not even the messaging was left to chance. Ahead of the first counteroffensive launched in the south on August 29th, public communications were carefully crafted to lay the groundwork for the second Ukrainian military campaign in the east, which began last week. Authorities have denied journalists access to the frontlines and only certain images posted on social media by Ukrainian soldiers are allowed to be published. The result: an impression that Ukraine is effortlessly pushing Russian forces back from territory they've controlled for more than six months. The truth, inevitably for a war zone, is far less clear-cut. CNN was given exclusive access to the town of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, just a day after pictures emerged showing soldiers hoisting the Ukrainian flag on the roof of the town's municipal building. Far from being a town under full Ukrainian control, CNN found one still being bitterly fought for. At the edge of the town, Vasyl -- who declined to give his last name for security reasons -- tells us that for days ""they (the Russians) were shelling and shelling"" in the ongoing fight in Kharkiv. On Sunday afternoon, the dull thud of outcoming artillery fire was punctuated by the more infrequent boom of incoming fire. Russian forces were still fighting for Kupiansk, a town that is crucial to their supply lines, connecting their military base across the northern border in Russia's Belgorod to Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region and the frontlines of the Donbas. Ukraine's top military commander General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi claimed Sunday that the country's military had retaken more than 3,000 square kilometers (around 1,158 square miles) of territory since the beginning of the month, much of that believed to be in the Kharkiv region. But on the ground, the fate of Kupiansk appears far from certain, indicating that maintaining Ukrainian control over newly liberated territory in the area could prove difficult. Further west, some villages have seen calm entirely restored such as in the Kharkiv region's Zaliznychne, liberated last week, as the eastern counteroffensive picked up speed. There, the fight appears to have been far less painful. ""I didn't even expect it would be so fast"", says 66-year-old Oleksandr Verbytsky, who witnessed the Russians retreating. ""I went to the store and when I came back, everybody was running away. The Russians drove through the cemetery to get away. Can you imagine?"" Near Zaliznychne, Ukrainian investigators had arrived, alerted to the possible evidence of a war crime. After the horrors discovered north of Kyiv -- such as in Bucha -- last April when Russian troops retreated after just a month-long occupation, Ukrainian authorities know all too well what to look for. War crime investigators were among the group of officials who arrived at a rundown house to hear from Maria, who had to bury her neighbor and his friend last February, just days after Russia crossed the Ukrainian border. ""I noticed the door had been ajar for days,"" says Maria Grygorova. ""And when I checked whether they were alive or maybe injured, I saw they were cold and then noticed two holes in Konstantin's forehead."" Locals in Zaliznychne describe the occupation as ""terrifying"" and though a sense of normalcy has returned, the fear of Russian troops coming back still hangs in the air. Serhii Bolvinov, head of Kharkiv region Police Investigative Department who said they are recording apparent war crimes ""in almost every village."" ""You never knew what the Russians were thinking,"" Verbytsky says. ""I made sure never to speak to them because I knew they could hit me so when they walked past me, I just turned away.""",14,3.6367632101517335,2.029613513089068,1.6071496970626655,15
2022-09-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/11/europe/ukraine-russia-eastern-front/index.html,Russia's collapse in northeast Ukraine ignites fury from Putin loyalists,"The last week has seen a stunning transformation of the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, as a swift armored offensive by Ukrainian forces rolled through lines of Russian defenses and recaptured more than 3,000 square kilometers (more than 1,100 square miles) of territory. That is more territory than Russian forces have captured in all their operations in Ukraine since April. As much as the offensive was brilliantly conceived and executed, it also succeeded because of Russian inadequacies. Throughout swathes of the Kharkiv region, Russian units were poorly organized and equipped -- and many offered little resistance. Their failures, and their disorderly retreat to the east, has made the goal of President Vladimir Putin's special military operation to take all of Luhansk and Donetsk regions considerably harder to attain. Over the weekend, the Russian retreat continued from border areas that had been occupied since March. Villages within five kilometers of the border were raising the Ukrainian flag. Live updates: Russia's war in Ukraine The collapse of Russian defenses has ignited recriminations among influential Russian military bloggers and personalities in Russian state media. As the Ukrainian flag was raised in one community after another over the last several days, one question came into focus: how does the Kremlin respond? A lightning operation Ukrainian officials had telegraphed that an offensive was imminent -- but not where it actually happened. There was plenty of noise about a counter-attack in the south, and even US officials talked about Ukrainian operations to ""shape the battlefield"" in Kherson. Russian reinforcements -- perhaps as many as 10,000 -- streamed into the region over a period of weeks. There was indeed a Ukrainian assault in Kherson, but one whose intention appears to have been to fix Russian forces, while the real effort came hundreds of miles to the north. It was a disinformation operation the Russians might have been proud of. Kateryna Stepanenko at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based analytical group, says the deception worked. ""Ukrainian military officials reported that (Russian) Eastern Military District elements that had previously supported offensive operations towards Sloviansk had redeployed to the Southern Axis,"" she told CNN. Their replacements were clearly not up to the job -- a mixed bag, Stepanenko said, of ""Cossack volunteers, volunteer units, DNR/LNR militia units, and the Russian Rosgvardia (National Guard). Such forces were not sufficient to defend a vast and complex front line."" The Ukrainians picked the weakest spot in Russian defenses for their initial thrust -- an area controlled by the Luhansk militia with Russian National Guard units further back. They were no match for a highly mobile armored assault that quickly rendered artillery irrelevant. Igor Strelkov, formerly the head of the Donetsk People's Republic militia and now a caustic critic of Russian military shortcomings, noted the poor training of these units and ""the exceptional caution of the actions of Russian aviation."" In short, Russian front-line units were hung out to dry without sufficient air support. Multiple videos geolocated and analyzed by CNN, as well as local accounts, depict a chaotic withdrawal of Russian units, with large amounts of ammunition and hardware left behind. The poor quality of Russian defenses along a critical north-south axis sustaining the Donetsk offensive is hard to fathom. Once underway, the intent of the Ukrainian offensive was crystal clear -- to destroy that artery of resupply. Within three days, they had done so -- not least because Russian reinforcements were slow to be mobilized. Recriminations begin The Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday sought to portray the abandonment of Kharkiv as a planned redirection of efforts to the Donetsk region -- but it actually complicates those efforts. Until this week, the Russians were able to attack Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk from three directions: north, east and south. The northern axis is now gone: the threat to the industrial belt in and around Sloviansk has much diminished, as has the prospect of Ukrainian defenses being surrounded. Simply put, the battlefield in eastern Ukraine has been redrawn in days. The most influential -- and perhaps surprising -- public critic of the situation was Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has supplied thousands of fighters to the offensive. In a Telegram post Sunday, he said he would be contacting senior officials at the Defense Ministry to spell out his message. ""It's clear that mistakes were made. I think they will draw a few conclusions,"" he said. Hinting at disarray among commanders, Kadyrov said that ""if Russia's General Staff did not want to leave, the (troops) wouldn't back out"" -- but Russian soldiers ""didn't have proper military training"" and that led to them to retreat. Influential military bloggers in Russia have been even more blunt. Zakhar Prilepin, whose Telegram channel has more than 250,000 subscribers, reposted a commentary that described events in Kharkiv as a ""catastrophe"" and a wholesale failure of intelligence. ""Now we can observe the result of the criminal irresponsibility of those who were responsible for this direction,"" the post reads, before concluding: ""The special military operation is long over. There is a war going on."" Another pro-Putin blogger who goes by the name Kholmogorov reposted an equally scathing account by the Partizan Telegram channel from the front lines, which that essentially accused the Russian authorities of abandoning the troops. ""The soldiers were on foot with one machine gun and a sack. Abandoned by the command, not knowing the way, they walked at random,"" the post said. The poster, who describes himself as a Russian Orthodox nationalist, says that while hatred of the enemy grows, ""hatred of the government and command is growing even more."" Adding his own thoughts, Kholmogorov said: ""Lord, save the Russian soldiers from blows from the front and even more from blows in the back."" A similar analysis came from the Telegram channel of Pyotr Lundstrem. ""There are NO thermal imagers, NO bulletproof vests, NO reconnaissance equipment, NO secure communications, NOT enough copters, NO first aid kits in the army."" Referring to commemorations in Russia this weekend for the Day of Moscow, the city's birthday, he added: ""You are celebrating a billionth holiday. What's wrong with you?"" On Saturday, as the rout continued, Putin was inaugurating a ferris wheel in Moscow. The Institute for the Study of War notes the ""withdrawal announcement further alienated the Russian milblogger and Russian nationalist communities that support the Kremlin's grandiose vision for capturing the entirety of Ukraine."" Putin's next move Prominent media figures in Russia are trying to spin this week's calamity as a planned operation. Television host Vladimir Soloviev reposted a Telegram commentary that insisted the ""enemy, buying into an easy advance on a given sector of the front, drives into a trap."" ""Currently, Russian units are purposefully regrouping,"" the commentary added, even though there is little sign of that. That begs the question as to how the Kremlin prosecutes the war after suffering its worst week of the entire campaign. It appears to be short of high-quality units. Some existing battalion tactical groups have been reconstituted; volunteer battalions have been raised across Russia to form a Third Army Corps. US officials say the Russians are running short of munitions, even turning to North Korea for supplies. Stepanenko, at the Institute for the Study of War, told CNN that the remarkable success of the Ukrainian counteroffensive will force a reappraisal of how the new army corps is used. Stepanenko, who studies the recruitment and organization of the Russian military, says the Russians ""might still attempt to use these units to stop the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kharkiv, although rushing ill-trained and unprepared raw units into such operations would be a highly dangerous endeavor."" She believes that given the Russian need for fresh manpower, ""it is likely that the Russian forces are deploying these elements directly onto the front lines in any case based on the reports that some volunteer battalions are already fighting on the Kherson front lines."" The Russian military can still bring considerable power to bear in terms of its rocket, artillery and missile forces. But despite one shuffle of the high command already, its ground operations seem poorly organized, with little autonomy devolved to commanders. The last week has laid bare issues of motivation and leadership. Russian bloggers who have supported the offensive say a radical rethink is required. One commented: ""A change of approach to the war in Ukraine is needed. Mobilization of the economy and industry. Creation of a political control center for war."" Strelkov came to the same conclusion, saying it is time to ""start fighting for real (with martial law, the mobilization of the army and the economy.)"" Throughout the conflict, Putin has avoided a general mobilization, which might be unpopular at home. It's impossible to know whether the Kremlin will now double down in an effort to complete the special military operation or begins to look for a negotiated settlement. The first option looks a tall order given the events of the last week; the second would be humiliating. The third possibility, perhaps the most likely, is that Russia will persist with its grinding inch-by-inch onslaught while taking little to no additional territory. But it now faces an adversary with the wind in its sails and fresh infusions of Western military aid being prepared for the winter months. Ukraine's battlefield advances have rejuvenated allied support, with a meeting in Germany this weekend producing further pledges of long-term support.",14,3.323172541172322,2.418354091752269,0.9048184494200533,24
2022-09-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/10/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-advances-intl-hnk/index.html,Ukrainian forces enter key city of Izium in a sign Kyiv's new offensive is working,"When Ukrainian forces entered the city of Izium Saturday, it was more than a major military victory. It was a sign the war in Ukraine might be entering a new phase, one in which Russian troops are scrambling to hold onto the territory they captured over the past six months. Russian forces were forced to flee the strategic eastern city just five days after Ukrainian forces began a new offensive eastward through the Kharkiv region. ""Russians escaped and left weapons and ammo behind. City center is free,"" a spokesperson for the Bohun Brigade of the Land Forces of Ukraine said in a statement Saturday afternoon. The last five days have seen the most ambitious ground assaults by the Ukrainians since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in late February. Video and satellite images geolocated by CNN show the advances have involved sustained attacks on command posts, ammunition stores, and fuel reserves far behind the front lines. A senior US official said Ukrainian forces had achieved some success in attacking Russian supply lines, with the intention of cutting off and isolating Russian troops west of the Dnipro River. Saturday's rapid advance did not end with Izium, as Ukraine appeared to have opened a new front against Russian defenses on the border of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The head of the regional military administration for Luhansk, Serhiy Hayday, indicated the city of Lysychansk was the target of the new offensive. Lysychansk was the last city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine to fall under Russian control in July, after weeks of intense fighting. Hayday told CNN on Saturday ""the occupiers, including both the collaborators and the military, are running away in a hurry."" ""Locals have videos and photos proving that,"" Hayday said. He said the visual evidence could not be shared for security reasons. CNN was unable to verify Hayday's claim, but at least one border crossing into Russia has seen lines of vehicles forming. Oleksiy Reznikov, the Ukrainian defense minister, said Saturday Ukraine's allies are ""amazed"" by the recent successes of the country's military. Speaking at the end of a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Ramstein Air Base, Germany, Reznikov said Ukraine's ""partners were positively amazed by the dynamics of our troops' activities"" in the south and east of the country. Russian reinforcements As Russian forces scramble to counter the Ukrainian advance in the east, Moscow is trying to reinforce its embattled military units there. Video footage taken by a Russian military journalist Yevgeniy Poddubny Friday showed Russian helicopters arriving in the region and at least one unloading an armored vehicle. Poddubny reported Friday Russian military headquarters was using Mi-26 helicopters to reinforce units in Kharkiv with both men and armored vehicles, redeploying reserve troops to both Kupyansk and Izium. But the reinforcements did not seem to have helped. In a big strategic win for Kyiv, both Izium and Kupyansk were recaptured. Izium, which sits near the border between the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, had been under Russian occupation for more than five months and had become an important hub for the invading military. Russia was using Izium as a launching pad for attacks southward into the Donetsk region and Kupyansk, some 30 miles to the north of Izium, as a rail hub to resupply its forces. Several videos of Ukrainian troops standing at the Izium sign at the entrance to the city were posted on Telegram. One piece of footage was purportedly filmed by a reconnaissance unit of Ukraine's 25th Paratroopers' Brigade. Over the video, a voice is heard saying: ""We are in Izium. Everything will be Ukraine. Our flag is here already."" Kyiv said its forces have also severed a major Russian supply line through the Kharkiv region and were moving further east. At the same time, the Ukrainian military said losses have been inflicted on Russian forces in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine. Even the Russian-backed authorities in Izium were forced to admit the retreat on Saturday. The head of the pro-Russian Izium city administration Vladislav Sokolov was quoted by the Russian state news agency RIA as saying the situation in Izium was ""very difficult."" Sokolov was later quoted by the Russian state news agency TASS as saying: ""We have begun the evacuation, albeit at a slow pace, but as far as possible, we are taking them to the territory of the Russian Federation."" Kirill Imashev, the military correspondent of a Russian Telegram channel, Readovka, said Russian forces had left Kupyansk and retreated across the river Oskil to ""regroup,"" but claimed residents of the city had ""left their homes in a hurry, fearing reprisals from the Kyiv regime."" ""Hundreds of cars are leaving from Kupyansk to the LPR [the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic],"" he said. The available evidence on social media networks shows the civilian population in the areas liberated have greeted Ukrainian forces with enthusiasm. Ukrainian officials have vowed anyone who collaborated with occupation forces will face criminal sanctions. Ukraine said some Russian troops are now deserting due to the ""significant losses"" they have suffered. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Friday at least 15 desertions had taken place. It said soldiers were abandoning their uniforms and wearing civilian clothes in an effort to blend in while attempting to return to Russian territory, it said. Meanwhile, Moscow was trying to paint a different picture of the Ukrainian advance. In its first response to the gains made by Ukrainian forces in the last few days, the Russian Defense Ministry has said ""the decision was made to regroup Russian troops in the areas of Balakleya and Izyum and redirect their efforts in the Donetsk direction."" The advancing Ukrainian troops have reported scenes of destruction as they retake areas from Russian control. The head of the Kharkiv region military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said he had toured recently-liberated areas where the Russians had ""left broken infrastructure and houses, many trophies and piles of garbage,"" and posted photographs of the scenes on Telegram. ""People, without exaggeration, met our soldiers with tears in their eyes,"" Syniehubov said. ""Residents, of course, need help. Most villages do not have electricity or gas. In the near future, we will restore them and bring in humanitarian aid."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said negotiations with the Russian Federation surrounding the end of the war are currently ""impossible"" while he was at the annual Yalta European Strategy meeting in Kyiv on Saturday. ""Russians are not ready to admit they have occupied our country. This means there will be no substantial dialogue,"" Zelensky said. ""In order for us to open a diplomatic corridor with [Russia], they must show political will, that they are ready to give back foreign land.""",14,1.7638163858628282,1.156164256068167,0.6076521297946611,21

Zelensky posted a video on his social media accounts with Ukrainian soldiers standing above a building in the key Kharkiv city of Balakliia, which was under Russian occupation for six months, alongside the Ukrainian flag. ""The order is fulfilled. Russian occupational troops have withdrawn,"" one of the soldiers says in the video. Ukrainian troops have also reached the city of Kupyansk in the Kharkiv region -- a key logistics and supply hub for Russian forces -- according to a photo showing Ukrainian soldiers holding a flag in front of a signpost at the southern entrance of the city, geolocated by CNN. Ukrainian forces have not yet retaken the city, which is roughly 70 miles (112 kilometers) east of Kharkiv. Russian military bloggers and analysts have said that Ukrainian forces' push towards Kupyansk aims to cut off supply lines to the strategic city of Izium to the south. Usually supportive of the Russian campaign in Ukraine, many have criticized Moscow's failure to predict a Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv, and the lack of troops and equipment in numbers capable of stopping a Ukrainian push. In a nightly address Thursday, Zelensky claimed the country's military had retaken more than 1,000 square kilometers of territory since the beginning of the month. Oleksii Hromov, the deputy head of the main operations directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said Ukrainian forces were able to advance 50 kilometers (about 31 miles) in the Kharkiv region and liberate ""more than 20 settlements."" Through geolocation and the statements of the Ukrainian military, independent analysts and Russian military bloggers, it's estimated that Ukrainian forces have taken well over 400 square kilometers of territory this week in the Kharkiv region. Meanwhile, some Russian troops in the Kharkiv region have deserted and abandoned their uniforms due to Russia's ""significant losses,"" the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said, adding that the soldiers are hoping to blend in while wearing civilian clothing. ""Personnel of the occupying forces in civilian clothes resort to desertion and try to return to the territory of the Russian Federation,"" the General Staff said in a situational update Friday, claiming that 15 such cases had been observed. The Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that the Russian 202nd Motorized Rifle Regiment, ""located in the Kharkiv region, withdrew from their positions and moved to the nearest forest. The unit was left without commanders and communications."" The Directorate claimed that Russian soldiers were ""calling to relatives with requests to contact the command and find out where they should go next. Some of them ask their wives to contact the hotlines of the Ministry of Defense of Russia and the Red Cross with the demand to remove them from the territory of Ukraine."" It provided no evidence for the assertion. Counteroffensives on two fronts While the southern front, in Kherson region, looks set to be one of the main theaters of conflict as the war heads towards winter, a new Ukrainian push in Kharkiv could stretch Russian forces across two disparate locations. In recent weeks, Russia redeployed some forces to the south to bolster its ranks ahead of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson region, according to Ukrainian officials and footage of equipment moving through Crimea geolocated by CNN. On Wednesday, Zelensky thanked units stationed in southern Ukraine what he called ""extremely successful hits"" on occupying Russian forces, while the simultaneous counterattack was launched in the north.

2022-09-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-counteroffensive-russia-intl/index.html,"As Ukraine pushes southern offensive, it also hits Russia in the northeast","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed ""good news"" from the northeastern Kharkiv region, after an apparent surprise counter-offensive forced Russian troops onto the back foot and prompted a pro-Kremlin official to call for evacuations. The Russian-installed head of the Kupiansk city administration, Vitaly Ganchev, urged women and children to evacuate the city as Ukrainian forces approached. Ganchev said the city, which lies west of the Donbas region and about 70 miles east of the city of Kharkiv, ""is constantly under terror"" and experiencing ""constant rocket attacks from the Armed Forces of Ukraine."" Ukrainian officials have declined to comment on the offensive in the northeast of Ukraine, but footage geolocated by CNN showed Ukrainian forces in the town of Volokhiv-Yar on Wednesday, around 50 km away from Kupiansk, and also on the outskirts of Balakliya to the south. Russian officials have also remained silent on developments in the Kharkiv region. The operation appeared designed to catch Russian forces off guard, following intensifying conflict in the south of Ukraine near the city of Kherson. In recent weeks, Russia redeployed some forces to the south to bolster its ranks ahead of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson region, according to Ukrainian officials and footage of equipment moving through Crimea geolocated by CNN. While the southern front looks set to be one of the main theaters of conflict as the war heads towards winter, a new Ukrainian push in Kharkiv could stretch Russian forces across two disparate locations. Kyiv ""likely used tactical surprise to advance at least 20km into Russian-held territory in eastern Kharkiv Oblast on September 7, recapturing approximately 400 square kilometers of ground,"" the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based analytical group, said its daily report on the conflict on Wednesday. ""Ukrainian forces likely took prudent advantage of a reallocation of Russian troops, equipment, and overall operational focus to launch localized counteroffensives toward critical points in Kharkiv Oblast,"" the ISW said. In recent weeks, Russia redeployed some forces to the south to bolster its ranks ahead of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson region, according to Ukrainian officials and footage of equipment moving through Crimea geolocated by CNN. Russian military bloggers and analysts have reported Ukrainian forces' push towards Kupiansk aims to cut off supply lines to the strategic city of Izium to the south. Zelensky was coy on whether specific settlements have been retaken by Ukrainian forces in his nightly address on Wednesday. But the President thanked three brigades involved in operations to recapture Russian-held territory there. ""This week we have good news from Kharkiv region,"" Zelensky said. ""Probably, you all have already seen reports about the activity of Ukrainian defenders. And, I think, every citizen feels proud of our soldiers. It is a well-deserved pride."" He also thanked units stationed in southern Ukraine what he called ""extremely successful hits"" on occupying Russian forces, while the simultaneous counter-attack was launched in the north. ""The more difficult it is for the occupiers, the more losses they have, the better the positions for our defenders in Donbas will be, the more reliable the defense of Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and the cities of Dnipropetrovsk region will be, the faster we will be able to liberate the Azov region and the entire south,"" he said.

2022-09-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/europe/russia-fsb-informants-cia/index.html,Revealed: How Russia's security service preys on young activists to turn them into informants,"Mikhail Sokolov knows Russian agents might be watching him. He says he spied on his own colleagues for Moscow for years. Now he says he is seeking asylum in the Netherlands, as he walks warily around the canals of Amsterdam, telling CNN about his recruitment as an informant, his betrayal of the opposition groups he joined, and why he got out. ""If we believe their words, they really think that the CIA is trying to facilitate a revolution in Russia and that Navalny is an agent from the CIA,"" Sokolov said of the FSB, the service that replaced the KGB when the Soviet Union fell. ""They deploy huge amounts of resources and effort not to let the revolution happen in Russia. They are looking for a foreign enemy."" He says the FSB is also ""obsessed"" with understanding who might succeed Alexey Navalny, poisoned and now imprisoned, as leader of the country's opposition movement. Sokolov's revelations are shining a rare light on the inner workings of the Kremlin's secretive security service and come as part of a string of recent defections from Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. CNN contacted the FSB and the CIA for comment on this story. The FSB did not respond and the CIA declined to comment. CNN has seen no credible evidence or claim of US government involvement in Russia's opposition movement. From student to spy Sokolov told CNN he was a ""regular 19-year-old student"" back in 2016 when he first got involved in political activism, joining the Russian Communist Party, essentially a Kremlin-sanctioned opposition group in modern-day Russia, and campaigning against such issues as rising fares for public transport. But he also launched his own independent anti-corruption investigations into local officials, which may have attracted some official attention. ""Russia now and Russia in 2016 are two different countries,"" he said. ""Back then you were able to be an activist and be safe. I am not blind, I see what problems my country has, my people have. I see how Europe lives. I was motivated to make my country better."" But while he was engaged in activism, he also dodged his compulsory military service and Sokolov says that's how the FSB targeted him. ""I was called in for a meeting with the head of the military enlistment office where I was met by an FSB officer. The officer said they had been following me for some time and gave me a choice: agree to cooperate or go to prison for two years."" Sokolov said he was scared of prison, where allegations of abuse are rife, and decided taking the deal was his only way out. Keeping tabs on Navalny money Within a year, in 2017, Sokolov started volunteering to work with Navalny's anti-corruption campaign, he told CNN. By 2021 he was on the organization's staff, and sharing key information with the FSB. Sometimes the FSB's interests seemed to align with his. ""On a regional level they are indeed interested in corrupt officials,"" Sokolov said. ""On a nationwide level they are interested in who is financing Navalny's campaign. They had a theory that we are financed by the CIA."" Sokolov told CNN he saw no evidence of CIA funding during his time working with the Navalny campaign, and Navalny himself has always categorically denied any links to US intelligence. As the Kremlin stepped up its crackdown on dissidents at home, Sokolov says he was sent by his FSB handlers to the former Soviet republic of Georgia to infiltrate the growing expatriate community of Russians escaping the repressions. Again, Sokolov said, the FSB seemed extremely concerned the CIA was recruiting Russians. ""They thought that Georgian security services are recruiting opposition members under the guidance of the American CIA,"" Sokolov said, although he again saw no evidence of this happening. Sokolov said he never believed what the FSB was doing was right and his work for them was a ""massive burden."" But still he undertook their missions for more than five years. War changed mission and minds Another young activist told CNN a similar story of coerced recruitment and then demands from the FSB. Vsevolod Osipov was a member of the fringe Libertarian Party of Russia when he was approached, even though he told CNN he thought the organization was too small and insignificant to merit attention from the security service. But after he was detained in May 2021, in connection with an earlier protest against Navalny's arrest, Osipov -- then just 19 -- agreed to spy on Russian individuals and groups opposed to President Vladimir Putin's government in return for avoiding prison. ""I had various tasks,"" he said. ""I had to meet particular people, get acquainted with them. For example, the leader of the Libertarian Party of Russia, Yaroslav Conway, or the head coordinator of the Free Russia Foundation in Georgia, Anton Mikhalchuk."" Again, there was a huge interest on what outside involvement, if any, there might be from Western intelligence organizations. ""There were other more complex tasks -- to find out whether there is any cooperation with the West or find out what was happening behind the scenes in a particular organization, if the opposition is working for American or other foreign special services,"" he said. Osipov said he too was sent to Georgia where he was told to monitor the views of the Russian community, especially about the war in Ukraine and how other countries and non-governmental organizations were helping Ukrainian refugees. ""As soon as the war started, my handler asked me to find out how the community generally feels about the invasion of Ukraine,"" he said. ""The FSB was also interested in any cooperation with Western security services or if anyone is receiving finances from abroad."" The fear was always what danger there could be to the Kremlin and Putin, he said. ""Russian security services are very well aware of the history of our country,"" Osipov said. ""When a huge immigrant community emerges abroad, where people speak freely to each other, work on projects together, help Ukrainian refugees, basically create a mini-Russia abroad, which is not under the control of FSB -- they are afraid that history will repeat itself as it was in 1917 when Lenin came to Moscow and started a revolution,"" he added. ""They are afraid that their regime will be impacted now during this war."" He says he is speaking now to try to right some of his wrongs and perhaps offer some protection for his mother who is still in Russia. ""I really want to get back home,"" he said. ""I do not hate the country, I hate our government,"" Osipov added. Back in Amsterdam, Mikhail Sokolov said it was the shock of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 that overwhelmed his fears of repercussions and forced him to turn his back on the FSB. ""I hate the way Russia is now. I hate everything connected to Russia now, the fact that they began war against our brotherly nation, my brotherly nation,"" he said.",3,6.636127021741636,7.742920224790817,-1.1067932030491807,18

The last week has seen the most ambitious ground assaults by the Ukrainians since the beginning of the invasion, following sustained attacks on command posts, ammunition stores, and fuel reserves far behind the front lines, according to geolocation of video and satellite imagery. The US has observed Ukrainian forces achieve some success in attacking Russian supply lines, with the intention of cutting off and isolating Russian troops currently deployed west of the Dnipro River, according to a senior US official. ""What we've seen in the Kherson region first is some continued offensive operations by the Ukrainians,"" Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters. ""They continue to make some forward movement. We are aware that they have retaken some villages."" Ryder also said that the US has seen ""some offensive Russian activity ... near Bakhmut."" According to Ukrainian officials, the goal is to take at least all territory north or west of the Dnipro River, including not only the city of Kherson but also Nova Kakhovka, site of an important hydroelectric plant as well as the canal that supplies Crimea with much of its water. At the same time, Ukrainian forces have stepped up attacks in Eastern Ukraine in order to prevent Russia from shifting forces to the South to attempt to repel the Ukrainian counteroffensive there, US officials said. In recent days, Ukrainian forces have pushed towards Russian supply lines south of Kharkiv, taking several villages and towns in the process. The current offensive in the south is broad-based -- extending more than 100 miles wide -- to prevent Russian units from concentrating on one point. Additionally, there has been an uptick in sabotage operations and attacks on pro-Russian officials in occupied areas. US officials acknowledge the Ukrainian goal of recapturing Kherson by the end of 2022 is ambitious but remains possible if Ukraine continues to make progress in its current operations. Ukrainian forces are planning for a long and brutal campaign to retake Russian-controlled territory. The current Ukrainian push is expected to extend into the Spring, with some of the attacks now intended to prepare the battlefield for planned advances over the next several months. Ukraine has been publicly signaling for months that it intended to launch a major counteroffensive to retake territory lost to Russia in the six-month war. And even before Ukrainian forces began increasing their artillery rocket and missile fire on the front lines in southern Ukraine, Kyiv had been actively disrupting Russian resupply efforts and command and control across the region. In the buildup to the current Ukrainian counteroffensive, the US urged Kyiv to keep the operation limited in both its objectives and its geography to avoid getting overextended and bogged down on multiple fronts, multiple US and western officials and Ukrainian sources previously told CNN. Those discussions involved engaging in ""war-gaming"" with Kyiv, the sources said -- analytical exercises that were intended to help the Ukrainian forces understand what force levels they would need to muster to be successful in different scenarios. The Ukrainians were initially considering a broader counteroffensive, but narrowed their mission to the south, in the Kherson region, in recent weeks, US and Ukrainian officials previously said.",14,6.450416195374582,2.585944943828248,3.864471251546334,21
2022-09-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/politics/russia-rockets-purchase-north-korea-ukraine/index.html,"Russia is purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea, US official says","Russia is in the process of purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, a US official tells CNN. The purchase indicates that the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions, according to the official. The US expects Russia could try to buy more military equipment from North Korea going forward, the official added. The New York Times first reported on the purchase. The two countries had formed relations through the Korean War of the 1950s, with the former Soviet Union having been a major benefactor to North Korea, financially propping the regime up. North Korea has blamed the US and the West for the war in Ukraine. News of Moscow buying weaponry from North Korea follows a recent US assessment that Russia now possesses weapons-capable drones from Iran also likely for use in the war in Ukraine. The US believes that Moscow officially purchased the Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series drones -- the Shahed-129 and Shahed-191 -- from Iran and transferred to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine. The drones are capable of carrying precision guided munitions and can be used for surveillance. Russia has been looking to hamper Ukrainian military's use of recently Western-supplied long-range precision artillery and rocket systems, including the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), on the battlefield. With the HIMARS, Ukraine has been able to precisely target and hit Russian command posts, logistical hubs and ammunition dumps well beyond the front lines. Defense Department press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during a briefing at the Pentagon Tuesday that Russia has approached North Korea to ""request ammunition."" The request from Russia to North Korea is ""indicative of the situation Russia finds itself in,"" Ryder said. ""It does demonstrate and is indicative of the situation Russia finds itself in in terms of logistics and sustainment capabilities as it relates to Ukraine,"" Ryder said. ""We assess that things are not going well on that front for Russia, so the fact that they're reaching out to North Korea is a sign that they're having some challenges on the sustainment front."" A sign Russia may be struggling to maintain supplies for Ukraine war The availability of ammunition will prove to be one of the most critical factors in Russia's ability to sustain its war in Ukraine, US officials told CNN. It has been difficult to assess Russia's levels of ammunition throughout the war, sources said, but its purchase of supplies from North Korea could suggest some Russian stocks are running low. US intelligence officials also believe that the Russians are running short on artillery shells and rockets, amid their scorched-earth tactics of unleashing artillery barrages on Ukrainian cities over the last six months. For now, though, the ammunition deficit does not appear particularly widespread, officials said. But it may be particularly acute for select types of high-caliber multiple launch rocket systems, low caliber artillery systems and precision guided weapons, said Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses. Kofman added that it will take time for Russia to meaningfully ramp up its production to meet the high volume of ammunition expenditure in the war, which the Russian defense industry clearly did not anticipate. In another signal that Moscow may be struggling to maintain the needed resources for its now six-month war, Russia has also been reallocating both manpower and equipment from far-flung military districts in both the east and the north, according to two sources familiar with US and western intelligence. And Russia moved earlier this year to restrict public access to information about its budget, including import and export figures. According to one of these sources, that blackout is a key indicator that Russia has been forced to aggressively redirect funding and other resources towards the conflict -- a fact that it would want to hide from its public. The Kremlin continues to insist that it is not waging a war, but only a limited ""special military operation.""",14,1.6223870366359847,8.121584943495957,-6.499197906859973,12

CNN first reported on the shooting in May, after obtaining exclusive surveillance video of what is being investigated as a war crime, a shooting targeting civilians. Now, Ukrainian prosecutors say they have informed Russia that their pre-trial investigation has zeroed in one of the Russian perpetrators they believe is responsible. The Bucha Prosecutors' Office in the Kyiv region says CNN's exclusive reporting was instrumental in helping identify the Russian soldier. Prosecutors say the suspect is Nikolay Sergeevich Sokovikov, adding that Russia was informed of his charges of ""violation of the laws and customs of war"" and ""intentional murder."" CNN has requested comment from Russia's defense ministry but has not had a response. CNN also asked the Russian MOD for response to our original report in May and never received a reply. Civilians shot in the back In newly obtained footage of the incident obtained by CNN this week, two soldiers can clearly be seen shooting at something next to a business they have just overtaken. Other videos of the incident reveal their target was two unarmed civilians, shot in the back immediately following what appears to be a calm conversation with the soldiers. The incident happened in March outside a vehicle dealership in a village near Kyiv, as Russian forces attempted to take the Ukrainian capital in the early days of the invasion. Sokovikov, along with another unidentified serviceman, inflicted at least 12 gunshot wounds on the civilians, according to Ukrainian prosecutors. They were part of a group of soldiers who then ransacked the business and loaded stolen goods into a car marked ""Tank Special Forces RUS,"" prosecutors said in a statement. CNN previously identified the victims. One was the owner of the looted dealership, whose family does not want to be named. The other was Leonid Oleksiyovych Plyats, a 68-year-old grandfather who worked as a guard there. In addition to the killing, surveillance video shows more unprofessional behavior by the group of five soldiers, who are seen on camera drinking and toasting each other. The group was identified as members of the invading force by their uniforms, analysis of who controlled what area at the time and witness statements. The footage has been verified by CNN. Prosecutors will not reveal exactly how they identified this particular soldier. But CNN has previously reported on one part of the process being used by Ukrainian authorities -- facial recognition technology. Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation uploads images of suspects into software that scrubs social media websites looking for matching photos. Once investigators have a match, they corroborate it with friends and family on the suspects' social media. The identification of this latest suspect for war crimes was months in the making, according to prosecutors. While the pre-trial investigation is ongoing, it is at least one step toward justice for the victims' families.",13,6.5992143172907,7.831468570385839,-1.2322542530951388,15

Those discussions involved engaging in ""war-gaming"" with Kyiv, the sources said -- analytical exercises that were intended to help the Ukrainian forces understand what force levels they would need to muster to be successful in different scenarios. The Ukrainians were initially considering a broader counteroffensive, but narrowed their mission to the south, in the Kherson region, in recent weeks, US and Ukrainian officials said. Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told CNN that ""the United States has routine military-to-military dialogue at multiple levels with Ukraine. We will not comment on the specifics of those engagements. Generally speaking, we provide the Ukrainians with information to help them better understand the threats they face and defend their country against Russian aggression. Ultimately, the Ukrainians are making the final decisions for their operations."" Officials say they believe there is now increased parity between the Ukrainian and Russian militaries. But western officials have been hesitant to label the nascent Ukrainian operation -- which appeared to begin on Monday in the southern province of Kherson -- a true ""counteroffensive."" How successful Ukraine is likely to be in regaining lost territory remains an open question, sources familiar with the latest intelligence tell CNN. Ukrainian officials have already said this offensive will likely be a slow operation, and punishingly cold winter weather is coming and then an early spring mud, both of which could force pauses in the fighting. Still, there is a distinct feeling amongst Ukraine's US and western advisers that the Ukrainian military is on much more even footing with Russia than was believed even just a few short months ago, multiple officials told CNN. Russia still maintains superior numbers in overall manpower and massed artillery. But Ukrainian capabilities, bolstered by sophisticated western arms and training, have closed an important gap, officials say -- particularly the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, that Ukraine has been using to launch attacks behind Russian front lines in recent months. ""It shows you what the sustained training and weapons provision can do when the force is highly motivated and capable in its employment,"" a senior NATO official told CNN. Another US military source put it more bluntly: Ukraine has made up for Russia's advantage in sheer volume of fire with its ""competence."" Growing momentum Ukraine has been publicly signaling for months that it intended to launch a major counteroffensive to retake territory lost to Russia in the six-month war. And even before Monday, when Ukrainian forces began increasing their artillery rocket and missile fire on the frontlines in southern Ukraine, Kyiv had been actively disrupting Russian resupply efforts and command and control across the region. For weeks, Ukraine has used a mix of partisan supporters, long-range fire and special operations forces to launch a series of attacks far behind Russian lines -- including in Crimea -- that have targeted logistics and command and control hubs in preparation for the southern offensive. ""I don't think it's possible yet to confirm the extent of Ukrainian advances, but they've certainly impacted Russia's ability to move north and south across [the Dnieper River] with their attacks on bridges,"" the senior NATO official said on Wednesday. ""And in terms of future prospects, I'd note that Ukraine is much closer to parity in troop numbers in Kherson than it has been in recent weeks"" in the eastern provinces of the country, where fighting has ground on for months. Attacks in Crimea have been a particularly smart strategy, one official said, because Russia has been using the peninsula as a launchpad for its operations in southern Ukraine. Russia has also been forced to pull resources from the east ""simply because of reports that the Ukrainians might be going more on the offense in the south,"" John Kirby, the communications coordinator for the National Security Council, said on Monday. ""And so they've had to deplete certain units ...in certain areas in the East in the Donbass, to respond to what they clearly believed was a looming threat of a counter offensive,"" Kirby said. A narrower mission US and Ukrainian sources tell CNN that earlier plans for the Ukrainian operation were initially broader, and involved a more ambitious effort to regain other territory lost to the Russian invasion over the last six months, including the southeastern oblast of Zaporizhzhia. But by Monday, Ukrainian officials appeared laser-focused on retaking the Kherson region. An administration official told CNN that in recent months, Ukraine has been asking the US for weapons specifically suited to their planned southern counteroffensive. The US fulfilled many of those requests -- including additional ammunition, artillery and javelins -- over the course of several presidential drawdown assistance packages provided to Ukraine over the last two months, the official said. The planning exercises also helped the United States better grasp what kind of equipment, munitions or intelligence it could offer that would be most useful to Ukraine. Over the course of the war, the US has been regularly providing Ukraine with military advice and intelligence, along with billions of dollars in equipment and weaponry. 'A slow operation to grind the enemy' Officials say that Ukraine now appears more evenly matched with Russian forces not only because of the advanced western weaponry that Ukraine has been using effectively, but also because the Ukrainians still have the advantage in terms of morale, unit cohesion, tactical acumen, and a superior ability to improvise on the fly. They have another advantage, too, two officials said: a population that is largely appalled by the Russian occupation, and willing to engage in partisan attacks to expel them -- such as assassinations and sabotage efforts behind enemy lines. Still, despite a more bullish assessment of Ukrainian fighting capabilities, US officials aren't placing any bets that Ukraine will successfully retake Kherson -- yet. ""I'm not sure this is going to be the big, massive counteroffensive that folks might be waiting on — it might be a smaller number of forces,"" the US military source cautioned. Much will depend on how well Russia is able to defend newly-claimed territory, the source said—something that it has not yet been called upon to do in the last six months. A Ukrainian presidential adviser also warned that the offensive will be a ""slow operation to grind the enemy."" ""This process will not be very fast,"" Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement posted on his Telegram account late Monday, ""but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.""

Tending to her geese, chickens and sole cow on the family's small holding was a way of life, and she couldn't bear to abandon the animals. ""How can I leave my home behind?"" 65-year-old Pokusaeva said. ""My daughter in Poland was telling me: Mum, you have to run from there."" But she stayed behind along with her husband on their 16-hectare farm, which they rent from a local landlord close to the edge of Ukrainian-held territory. Since Ukraine announced the start of a counteroffensive to retake the Russian-occupied Kherson region on Monday, the fighting has intensified near their home. ""My heart was jumping out, especially when the planes were flying over us,"" Pokusaeva said. ""Every day and night -- bang bang. I can't take it anymore. People are suffering."" But despite the increased danger, Pokusaeva is very supportive of the Ukrainian army, and its mission to recapture land from the Russians. The offensive is still in its early days, but Ukrainian forces have already claimed some early gains, taking back four villages from the Russians on Monday, a Ukrainian military source told CNN. Driving past Pokusaeva's home and towards the front line through tiny villages, the area appeared largely deserted by both residents and troops. It became clear how quickly the Ukrainians had advanced, with some checkpoints left unmanned and signs of recent shell casings and military ration packs littering the side of the road. Further to the south lies the primary target of the Ukrainian troops: the city of Kherson, the only regional capital to have fallen to Russia since the war began. Ukrainian troops had broken through Russian defenses in ""several"" areas of the front line near the city of Kherson, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the head of the office of President Volodymr Zelensky, said Monday. For its part, Russia said it had managed to repel the Ukrainian advance, claiming that Ukraine had ""suffered heavy losses"" and ""failed miserably"" in their ""attempted"" offensive. Videos posted on Telegram and Twitter showed fighting in and around the city over the past few days, and the Antonivskyi bridge was also damaged, cutting off a key supply line for the Russians. ""Now [the Russians] do not have the transport ability to pull up reserves from the left bank (of the river),"" Natalia Humeniuk, head of the United Coordinating Press Center of Security and Defense Forces of the South of Ukraine, said on Tuesday. ""They may continue to try to set up a ferry or pontoon crossing, but the whole area where it can be deployed is also under our fire control and will be hit,"" she added. On Monday, she warned Kherson residents who have not managed to escape to find a place to shelter until the fighting is over. Even before the counteroffensive began, residents had been fleeing the city of Kherson and the surrounding region for months. Many of them gravitate to the city of Kryvyi Rih, around 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the front line in Kherson region. ""Our house was hit,"" Smirnova Galina, 61, said. ""That was why we fled."" Along with her husband Prokopenko, she now shares a room with more than a dozen other people in a Kryvyi Rih primary school turned shelter, which is home to 86 internally displaced people. ""I just want to go back to my village,"" said 83-year-old Lypchak Lubbock, who made it to the shelter accompanied by her son-in-law. They fled three weeks ago when their village was occupied by Russians. ""There was a lot of shelling,"" Lubbock said. ""I couldn't go out to the streets, it was very dangerous."" For the Ukrainian troops fighting to take back these villages, any progress in this potential lengthy battle could be tenuous, but their morale has been given a boost by the early signs of success.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky also issued a warning to Russian forces during his evening address Monday, saying it was time for them to ""run away, go home,"" and that ""the occupiers must know we will chase them to the border."" Yet one of his advisers cautioned that the operation will be a slow one, that would ""grind the enemy."" ""This process will not be very fast,"" Oleksiy Arestovych, adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement posted on Telegram late Monday, ""but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine."" ""[The Ukrainian Armed Forces] have broken through the frontline in several sectors,"" Arestovych said in a video interview posted on YouTube, adding that Ukrainian forces were shelling ferry crossing points that Moscow is using to resupply Russian-occupied territory over the Dnipro River in the Kherson region. ""We suppress their attempts to supply their groups on the west bank [of the Dnipro],"" he said. ""We strike at reserves, including reserves that are on the east bank and are trying to cross."" Earlier Monday, a Ukrainian military source told CNN that Ukrainian troops had taken four villages -- Novodmytrivka, Arkhanhel's'ke, Tomyna Balka and Pravdyne -- back from Russian occupation, adding that the main target was the city of Kherson. ""The operation began at night with massive shelling of Russian positions and the rear,"" the source, who is not being named for security reasons, told CNN. Russia's defense ministry acknowledged Kyiv's operation but claimed that Ukrainian troops had ""suffered heavy losses"" and ""failed miserably"" in their ""attempted"" offensive. CNN has not been able to verify both Russian and Ukrainian claims. The Kherson region, crucial to controlling Ukraine's southern coast and access to the Black Sea, was one of the first areas to be occupied by Russian forces when they invaded more than six months ago. In recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have been making advances around Kherson, including the targeting of critical bridges to disrupt Russian supply routes. At a Tuesday briefing, Natalia Humeniuk, spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military's Operational Command South, said damage to bridges across the Dnipro river means that Russian forces are unable to assist units on the frontlines further north. ""Now they [the Russians] do not have the transport ability to pull up reserves from the Left bank. Therefore, they create the illusion of pulling up reserves by moving military units between the settlements ... All bridges have been worked by us as impassable,"" she said. ""They may continue to try to set up a ferry or pontoon crossing, but the whole area where it can be deployed is also under our fire control and will be hit."" Ukrainian forces also launched an attack at the Russian-held town of Nova Kakhovka on Monday, knocking out its electricity and water supply, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti, who cited a Russian-appointed local authority. RIA quoted the head of civil-military administration in the town, Vladimir Leontyev, as saying the consequences of the strike ""will probably be terrible."" ""You can't leave now. There was a lot of shelling, something exploded. There were strikes in the city and near the hydroelectric plant. We can see the fire in both places,"" Leontyev added. UN inspectors prepare to visit nuclear plant The counteroffensive comes as a delegation of 14 international experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived in Kyiv ahead of a planned visit to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine later this week. The nuclear plant, which is Europe's largest, has been under Russian control since March. Clashes around the complex have sparked widespread concern and fears of a disaster. Kyiv has repeatedly accused Russian forces of storing heavy weaponry inside the complex and using it as cover to launch attacks, knowing that Ukraine can't return fire without risking hitting one of the plant's six reactors. Russia has claimed that they do not have any ""heavy weaponry"" at the nuclear power plant. Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showed four holes in the roof of the plant's building, near at least three Russian armored personnel carriers. In the satellite images, at least three Russian armored personnel carriers are seen sitting underneath a large structure with pipes, which feed from the building into all six of the nuclear reactors. The Russian-appointed leader for the Zaporizhzhia region, Vladimir Rogov, claimed that the holes were the result of a Ukrainian military strike on the complex. CNN has geolocated and confirmed the authenticity of the photos, but not the claims that the holes were the result of a Ukrainian military strike. Ukraine and Russia continued to blame each other Tuesday for shelling the area around the plant. CNN is unable to verify who is responsible. Russian authorities -- who now control the plant and the nearby city of Enerhodar -- reported artillery strikes early Tuesday morning close to a spent fuel storage building. Kyiv blamed Moscow for the attack. Russia ""is deliberately shelling corridors for [the] IAEA mission to reach ZNPP [the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant],"" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky's Head of the Office, alleged in a tweet that reiterated Ukrainian demands for Russian troops to withdraw from the plant. Concerns over a possible nuclear accident saw Zaporizhzhia city authorities handing out iodine pills to residents. On Tuesday, the European Union said it was donating 5.5 million potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine to protect people from potential radiation exposure. ""No nuclear power plant should ever be used as a war theater. It is unacceptable that civilian lives are put in danger. All military action around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant must stop immediately,"" EU Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said. Meanwhile, US officials believe Ukraine's long anticipated counteroffensive will include a combination of air and ground operations. John Kirby, the communications coordinator for the National Security Council, said Monday that regardless of the size, scale and scope of the latest counteroffensive, the Ukrainians ""have already had an impact on Russian military capabilities."" ""Because the Russians have had to pull resources from the east simply because of reports that the Ukrainians might be going more on the offense in the south,"" Kirby said. ""And so they've had to deplete certain units ... in certain areas in the east in the Donbas (region), to respond to what they clearly believed was a looming threat of a counteroffensive."" Kirby also said that Russia ""continues to have manpower problems"" in Ukraine and is trying to expand its recruitment of fighters inside Russia as well as ""entice"" some of their conscripts and contract soldiers to serve beyond their timeframes.",14,0.8886234759804754,3.0699683287606505,-2.181344852780175,8

Shaping operations are standard military practice prior to an offensive and involve striking weapons systems, command and control, ammunition depots and other targets to prepare the battlefield for planned advances. The US believes the Ukrainian counteroffensive, which has long been anticipated, will include a combination of air and ground operations. Ukraine indicated Monday morning that the actions were underway. ""Yes, (Ukrainian forces) have started the offensive actions in several directions on the South front towards liberating the occupied territories,"" Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Operational Command South, told CNN, adding, ""All the details will be available after the operation is fulfilled."" The plans come as Russia's war in Ukraine has passed its six-month mark, with US assessments indicating that Russia has been able to deploy fewer units to the frontlines than initially thought, according to a senior US official. The official said many of the existing units -- which Russia organizes into Battlefield Tactical Groups, or BTGs, comprising infantry, tanks, artillery and air defense -- are deploying below strength, some even at half their normal manpower. The US has also been observing Ukrainian forces benefiting from the use of US- and NATO-supplied HIMARS mobile rocket launchers, which have allowed Ukraine to strike and destroy targets in Russian-held territory. CNN reported last week that US and European officials say Ukraine has successfully used a method of resistance warfare developed by US special operations forces to fight back against Russia and bog down its vastly superior military. The Resistance Operating Concept was developed in 2013 following Russia's war with Georgia a few years earlier but its value was only realized after Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. It provides a blueprint for smaller nations to effectively resist and confront a larger neighbor that has invaded. Neither Ukrainian nor US officials are revealing the main targets of the expected counteroffensive. In recent weeks Ukrainian forces have been making advances around the key southern city of Kherson, which is currently occupied by Russian forces. Kherson is considered crucial to the control of Ukraine's southern coast and access to the Black Sea. Ukrainian and Russian forces have also been engaged in intense fighting in recent days around the nuclear power plant -- Europe's largest -- in the city of Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine's nuclear operator Energoatom said Friday that the plant had been reconnected to Ukraine's electricity grid a day after the plant went offline for the first time in its history.",14,2.46730487810063,8.116499268650037,-5.649194390549407,21

Morozova said the American was killed Tuesday while fighting in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine. His body has been transferred to a mortuary in the DPR, Morozova said. The DPR, a self-declared Russian-backed separatist region, said it had informed US officials and the head of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission, and ""we confirm our readiness to hand over his remains to his relatives for burial,"" according to Morozova. ""I want to reiterate that mercenaries are not being considered as combatants and the international humanitarian laws are not valid in their cases. These individuals are stripped of any immunity during the fighting,"" she said. ""I strongly recommend that any foreign nationals who came to Ukraine with militaristic purposes immediately leave the territory of the said country. Otherwise nobody will be held responsible for their lives and security."" While Russian media has released the name of this American, the State Department has not released his identity. ""We can confirm the death of a US citizen in Ukraine,"" a State Department spokesperson said. ""Out of respect for the privacy of the family, we have no further comment at this time,"" the spokesperson added. This is at least the third US citizen to die in the invasion. Stephen Zabierslki was killed in May and Marine Corps veteran Willy Cancel was killed in April. Two American volunteers fighting for Ukraine have been held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk. US citizens Alexander John-Robert Drueke, 39, from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, from Hartselle, Alabama, had been fighting alongside Ukrainian forces north of Kharkiv before they were captured. CNN has reported that a third American US Marine veteran Grady Kurpasi is missing in action. The last time his wife and close friends had heard from Kurpasi was in April. He chose to volunteer alongside Ukrainians in Ukraine but initially did not envision himself fighting on the front lines, a family friend told CNN. In June, a DPR court also sentenced two British citizens and a Moroccan national to death after accusing them of being ""mercenaries"" for Ukraine, state media outlet RIA Novosti reported at the time. Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Brahim Saadoune were foreign fighters captured in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol by Russian forces in April. Pinner's family subsequently said they were ""devastated"" that he ""should be accorded all the rights of a prisoner of war"" according to the Geneva Conventions. One month later, two more Britons were charged as being ""mercenaries,"" Donetsk News Agency reported at the time. Russia is the only country that considers the DPR independent.

2022-08-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/27/politics/russia-ukraine-resistance-warfare/index.html,How Ukraine is using resistance warfare developed by the US to fight back against Russia,"As the war in Ukraine has passed the six-month mark, US and European officials say Ukraine has successfully used a method of resistance warfare developed by US special operations forces to fight back against Russia and bog down its vastly superior military. The Resistance Operating Concept was developed in 2013 following Russia's war with Georgia a few years earlier but its value was only realized after Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. It provides a blueprint for smaller nations to effectively resist and confront a larger neighbor that has invaded. Russia's nearly bloodless takeover and annexation of the occupied territory stunned Ukraine and the west, intensifying a study of how to build a plan for total defense that included not only the military, but also the civilian population. But Putin's wider war on Ukraine launched in February has been its proving ground. The doctrine, also known as the ROC, provides an innovative and unconventional approach to warfare and total defense that has guided not just Ukraine's military, but also involved the country's civilian population as part of a concerted resistance against Russia's army. ""It's all hands on deck in terms of the comprehensive defense for the government of Ukraine,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Schwartz, who was commander of Special Operations Command Europe during the doctrine's development. ""They're using every resource and they're also using some highly unconventional means by which to disrupt the Russian federation military."" Planning a national resistance Outnumbered, outgunned, and outmanned, Ukraine has nevertheless fought back against a Russian military that thought it would romp through the vast majority of the country within a matter of weeks, if not days. ""This is a way to turn the tables on a first world power,"" said Schwartz. ""It's just incredible to watch that despite the unbelievable loss of life and sacrifice, what the will to resist and the resolve to resist can do."" In a series of recent attacks and explosions at Russian positions in Crimea, Kevin D. Stringer, a retired Army Colonel who led the development team for the resistance concept, sees signs of its use. ""Since you can't do it conventionally, you would use special operations forces, and those [forces] would need resistance support -- intelligence, resources, logistics -- in order to access these regions."" A Ukrainian government report shared with CNN acknowledged Ukraine was behind the attacks on Russian bases and an ammunition depot. The attacks, far behind enemy lines, were beyond the range of the weapons the US and others have publicly sent to Ukraine, and videos of the explosions did not appear to show any incoming missile or drone. Russia blamed sabotage or detonating ammunition for the explosions. ""High probability would say it's very plausible that [the ROC] principles are playing out in actual warfare right now,"" Stringer said. In early-April, Gen. Richard Clarke, the commander of US Special Operations Command, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that the US had helped train resistance companies in Ukraine embedded with special forces over the past 18 months. When asked if he was seeing some of the success of that training in the current conflict, Clarke was direct in his answer. ""Yes, Senator, we are."" Resistance in Ukraine Early in the conflict, the Ukrainian government created a website that explains different ways to resist. The site describes ways of using of nonviolent actions, including boycotting public events, labor strikes, and even how to use humor and satire. The goal is to disrupt the ability of pro-Russian authorities to govern while reminding the population of Ukraine's rightful sovereignty. The resistance doctrine suggests violent actions as well, including using Molotov cocktails, deliberately starting fires and putting chemicals in gas tanks to sabotage enemy vehicles. The doctrine also calls for a broad messaging campaign to control the narrative of the conflict, prevent an occupier's message from taking hold, and keeping the population united. Videos of Ukrainian strikes against Russian tanks, often to a soundtrack of pop music or heavy metal, have gone viral, as have clips of Ukrainian soldiers rescuing stray animals. Whether intentional or not, it becomes part of the resistance, allowing Ukraine to frame the headlines in western media in their favor and often humanizing Ukrainian service members in ways the Russian military has abjectly failed to do. At the forefront of the resistance is Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, who has not let the conflict fade out of sight with nightly speeches and frequent international appearances. His visits near the front-lines make news around the world, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is rarely seen outside the Kremlin or the resort of Sochi. The ongoing messaging barrage has spurred a groundswell of overseas support and successfully increased on western governments to supply more arms and ammunition to Ukraine. Resilience and Resistance Overall, the resistance concept provides a framework for increasing a country's resilience, which is its ability to withstand external pressures, and planning for resistance, defined as a whole-of-country effort to re-establish sovereignty in occupied territories. ""Resilience is society's strength in peacetime that becomes resistance in wartime against the aggressor,"" explained Dalia Bankauskaite, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis who has studied resistance planning in Lithuania. Instead of providing each country the same set of plans, the doctrine is designed to be tailored to each country's population, abilities, and terrain. It is not intended to create or support an insurgency; its goal is to establish a government-sanctioned force that will carry out activities against a foreign occupier with the goal of restoring sovereignty. At first, only Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland expressed real enthusiasm about the new doctrine. But after Russia's nearly bloodless takeover and annexation of Crimea stunned Ukraine and the west in 2014, interest in the resistance method rapidly grew. Since its inception, at least 15 countries have taken part in some form of training on this resistance doctrine, according to Nicole Kirschmann, a spokeswoman for Special Operations Command Europe, where this was developed. In mid-November, as the Biden administration was sounding the first public warnings about the potential for a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Hungary hosted a conference about the Resistance Operating Concept. The commander of Ukraine's Special Operations Forces was at the conference, Kirschmann told CNN, as well as nearly a dozen other countries. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has only increased interest in the concept. ""Baltic states, in particular, are actively talking in their parliaments about implementation of ROC at a national level,"" according to a US official. Resistance in the Baltics In May, nearly three months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania's parliament adopted a new strategy for civil resistance that is much broader than strictly resistance against occupation. Martynas Bendikas, a spokesman for the country's Ministry of National Defence, said that preparing for resistance includes developing the will to defend the country, improving citizens' military and non-military knowledge and skills, and more as part of a national defense. The existence of the resistance doctrine and parts of the planning around resistance is intentionally public, explained Stringer, intended to act as a deterrent against a potential attack, one more aimed at Russia's favored hybrid warfare instead of traditional military and nuclear deterrence. But the details of the plans and the organization within a country are tightly held. For Estonia, a country with a population of about 1.3 million people bordering northwest Russia, civil resistance has always been a part of the defense plan. ""There's no other option for every Estonian,"" said Rene Toomse, a spokesman for the volunteer Estonian Defense League. ""Either you fight for independence if someone attacks you - if Russia attacks you - or you just die."" Estonia regularly updates and develops its defense plans, integrating its standing military with its general population and its volunteer forces, which Toomse said have seen a surge in applications since the beginning of Russia's invasion. Estonian officials have studied the war in Ukraine to learn lessons about what has worked well against Russia, and where Ukraine's resistance could improve. Toomse says Estonians remember Soviet rule well, and those too young to remember are taught in school. Ukraine has excelled at winning the information campaign, Toomse points out, using media posts across multiple platforms, a president who has become a vocal international figure, and a steady stream of information about how well Ukraine's forces are fighting, ""even if they're not emphasizing their own losses."" But Toomse insists Estonia, if it faced invasion, would be more active in any occupied territory, using small, well-armed and well-trained units. ""I imagine that we can do much more damage behind enemy lines than Ukraine has done,"" Toomse said. ""All the logistics, all the convoys, are going to be constantly under attack.""",14,6.4864416233982585,3.651046364140869,2.8353952592573894,21

The ​researchers say these ​sites are used by Russian forces ​and their allies to process, register, interrogate and detain Ukrainians trying to ​leave Russian-occupied territory. ​Those detained can include civilians and prisoners of war. ​The Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab (Yale HRL) in collaboration with US State Department-supported Conflict Observatory used open-source information and high-resolution satellite imagery to map them. ​ According to the report, there is evidence suggesting they were set up even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine began and grew following the capture of Mariupol in April. ""The conditions reported by those released from the facilities examined here can constitute cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment under international humanitarian and human rights law,"" the study says, adding that the ""conditions include overcrowded facilities, a lack of access to adequate sanitation, insufficient food and clean water, exposure to the elements, denial of medical care, and the use of isolation."" ""In some specific instances, the treatment described as having been endured by those released, such as use of electric shocks, extreme conditions of isolation, and physical assault, may potentially constitute torture if proven,"" the study says. ​In a separate press release Thursday, the US State Department described the ""unlawful transfer and deportation of protected persons"" described in the study as ""a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and constitutes a war crime."" Volnovakha Correctional Colony is one of the ​​sites described in the study. Detailed ​findings allege it is a long-term facility for those who didn't pass filtration ​along with prisoners of war who surrendered after the Azovstal steel plant siege. The study notes the accounts of apparent survivors who described among other things: overcrowded cells, forced labor and even torture. Yale HRL says it identified two areas of disturbed earth along the south and southwest sections of that facility which appear to be mass graves. ​ An account cited in the report ​from someone described as a ""survivor"" also claimed a cellmate had been working a shift digging graves inside the colony. In July there was a deadly explosion there ​in which Ukrainian separatists say 53 POWs were killed, but the satellite images ​used for the report predate this. The Yale study notes that ""without further investigation, including the ability to independently excavate these locations, no definitive determination can be made about what these sites may contain based only on the evidence ​in this report."" Threats and humiliation Earlier this year CNN spoke to a number of Ukrainians who went through ""filtration"" and described facing threats and humiliation during the process. They say they were asked about their politics, future plans and views on the war. ​Some ​of the people ​who spoke to CNN said they knew of others who had been picked up by Russian troops or separatist soldiers and disappeared without a trace. The Kremlin has denied using so-called filtration camps to cover up wrongdoing and targeting civilians in Mariupol. ​ In the Yale study, the Russian Embassy in Washington said the system ""is about checkpoints for civilians leaving the active combat zone. In order to avoid sabotage operations by the Ukrainian nationalists' battalions, Russian soldiers carefully inspect vehicles heading to safe regions."" It adds that it will ""detain bandits and fascists"" and that the Russian military does not create barriers for civilians but helps them by providing food and medicine. In CNN reporting from July, Dmitry Vaschenko, an official with Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations in Taganrog, said housing would be given to Ukrainians, who were also free to seek work and send their children to school. ""When hostilities end in the future, all these arrivals can make the decision to return to their homeland. Whoever wishes to remain in Russia, the Russian government takes such an obligation -- they will receive a full range of social services and are protected,"" he said. When asked about the process to allow refugees into Russia, he said there were ""filtration points"" on the border. ""They are checking people who appear aggressively disposed towards the Russian Federation,"" he said. ""Filtering occurs precisely upon arrival, there are no 'mass camps.' They are border-crossing points, nothing more."" The self-declared DPR has denied accusations by Ukrainian authorities of unlawful detentions, filtration and maltreatment of Ukrainian citizens and said that those arriving at what it calls ​""reception centers​"" are properly fed and provided medical attention. ""The Donetsk oblast filtration system run by Russia and their proxies represents an urgent human rights emergency,"" Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of Yale HRL said in the ​press release from the Yale School of Public Health. ""International monitors need unfettered access to these facilities today. Every day that passes without independent monitors being present in these locations increases the risk that grave human rights abuses may be occurring with impunity."" According to the study​'s methodology, ""each source was evaluated using criteria established by the Berkeley Protocol on Digital Open Source Investigations."" It added that data points ""were cross-referenced against recent very high-resolution satellite imagery.

Officials are ""actively defending against foreign interference and influence operations in U.S. elections,"" US Cyber Command and the National Security Agency said in a statement, ""specifically by focusing on how adversaries seek to undermine U.S. interests and prosperity, the will to vote of the populace, as well as their belief in the sanctity and security of their elections."" US intelligence officials are warning that Russia, China and Iran may seek to interfere in the US voting process or shape voters' perceptions, according to the command. Asked last month whether the war in Ukraine may distract Russia from interfering in the US midterm elections, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was ""quite confident the Russians can walk and chew gum"" and that US officials were preparing accordingly. US officials also ""have to be concerned about hybrid threats,"" Wray said at a cybersecurity conference at Fordham University in New York. That includes a situation in which foreign operatives might use an ""unremarkable cyber incident"" to sow ""panic or lack of confidence in our election infrastructure,"" Wray said. In a separate intelligence bulletin sent to state and local officials this week, the Department of Homeland Security said Russia will likely continue to use its hacking and information operation capabilities to undercut trust in US public institutions and sow discord in the US. The DHS analysis, obtained by CNN, focuses on Russia's broader cyber activity against various sectors and not specifically on elections. ""Moscow will continue to seek new methods of circumventing US social media companies' anti-disinformation activities to further expand its narratives globally,"" the memo says. Facing a rise in violent threats, election officials are under intense pressure as the midterm vote approaches. In addition to any foreign interference, election officials will have to contend with extensive mis- and disinformation about election integrity spread by Americans, many who falsely claim that President Joe Biden was not legitimately elected. Cyber Command is the US military's offensive and defense cyber unit that has since 2018 increasingly focused on protecting elections from foreign meddling. The command and the NSA, the US signals intelligence agency, again formed an election-security focused team to be on the hunt for foreign threats, as they did in 2020. The Cyber Command-NSA Election Security Group ""continues to increase information-sharing of cyber threats and insights with industry and interagency counterparts,"" Maj. Katrina Cheesman, a spokesperson for the group, told CNN. ""We are complementing efforts of industry through identifying and attributing foreign malicious behavior,""' and sharing insights on the activity with non-government partners, Cheesman added. Cyber Command did not go into detail in its statement Thursday on recent operations it has conducted to defend US elections, but its past work has included knocking offline a Russian troll farm spouting disinformation during the 2018 election. US military and intelligence officials have gotten more involved, along with the Department of Homeland Security, in trying to thwart foreign hacking and influence operations following the 2016 presidential election. That year, Russian military intelligence operatives hacked and leaked emails belonging to the Democratic party in an effort to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, according to US intelligence reports. Federal and state and local officials now regularly drill for hacking and information operations that could interfere with the vote. Last week, officials from across the country held one such drill involving an array of hypothetical threats to election operations. ""The nation's election officials face a range of challenges, including cyber and physical risks to their infrastructure, and false election information that weaken voters' trust in the process,"" US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly and other federal and state officials said in a joint statement after the exercise.",3,3.0480612403828165,0.516497072695474,2.5315641676873426,23
2022-08-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/us-israel-cyberattacks-sharing-agreement/index.html,US and Israeli agencies use new agreement to defend against cyberattacks,"The US and Israeli governments have shared key details of unrelated cyberattacks on their infrastructure -- one from suspected pro-Russia hackers and the other from possible Iranian hackers -- as part of heightened efforts in recent months to bolster cyber defense between the two allies, a senior US Treasury official told CNN. The exchange of the intelligence, enabled by a finalized agreement the Treasury Department will announce Thursday, underscores the value both governments place in tapping data gathered by their private sectors to guard against an array of hacking threats from governments and cybercriminals alike. It also shows that, despite the revelation in February that Israeli-made spyware had allegedly been used against US diplomats, Jerusalem and Washington are still in lockstep on some cyber-related issues. One of the hacking incidents, which hasn't been previously reported, involved hackers unsuccessfully trying to overwhelm the US Treasury Department's computer servers and knock them offline in February and March, around the time that Russia waged war in Ukraine and the US slapped sanctions on the Kremlin, according to Todd Conklin, deputy assistant Treasury for cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection. The malicious cyber activity -- known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack -- did not impact Treasury operations, Conklin said, but it was significant enough that US officials passed detailed information on it to their Israeli counterparts so they could check their systems for the threat. Officials did not pinpoint the culprit but Conklin said he suspected hackers sympathetic to Russia may have been responsible. In a separate incident, the Israeli government in March was hit by a DDoS attack that temporarily knocked some government websites offline, a hack that some Israeli press reports suggested originated in Iran. The Israelis shared technical information on the attack with the US Treasury, Conklin said, which passed it along to American financial firms that are no stranger to Iranian attempts to disrupt their systems. Both of the hacking incidents are examples of how the new agreement to rapidly trade threat data is supposed to work in practice, according to Conklin. There are other means for the two governments to share cyberthreat data, including between defense and homeland security agencies. But the new agreement means officials in the Israeli finance ministry and the US Treasury will have a formal means -- rather than an ad hoc arrangement that relies on personal relationships -- of rapidly sharing hacking threats to their respective financial sectors. The agreement could also lead to more cyberattack drills involving big US financial firms and their Israeli counterparts, Conklin said. ""Israel has a really strong public-private partnership in this space,"" Conklin told CNN. ""So they have access to a lot more real-time vulnerability data impacting ... not only government systems, but also their broader private sector."" The US and Israel have a long and complicated history of collaborating in cyberspace that has been at times strengthened -- and tested -- by their shared foe in Iran. US and Israeli operatives were reportedly behind a 2009 and 2010 operation to hack sensitive computer systems and destroy uranium-enrichment centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear facility. The US is currently seeking to revive the 2015 agreement with Iran to set limits on Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Iranian hacking operations sometimes ebb and flow in response to geopolitical events, according to analysts. There have been no public reports of a shift in Iranian cyber activity around the latest nuclear-deal negotiations. The new agreement with Israel, however, ""would offer an opportunity as a first-alert-type mechanism for us"" if there was any new Iranian hacking activity aimed at the US or Israel, Conklin said.",3,0.8786087941470152,4.36054899682838,-3.4819402026813653,23

Wednesday's anniversary -- which commemorates 31 years since Ukraine broke its ties with the Soviet Union -- also marks six months since Russia's unprovoked invasion of the country. ""The US Embassy urges US citizens to depart Ukraine now using privately available ground transportation options if it is safe to do so,"" a security alert on the embassy's website said. ""The security situation throughout Ukraine is highly volatile and conditions may deteriorate without warning."" The renewed US alert comes follows similar warnings from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other officials that Moscow may carry out intense attacks, including missile strikes, around August 24. ""We must all be aware that this week Russia could try to do something particularly ugly, something particularly vicious,"" Zelensky said in a video message at the weekend. Ukraine's government warned citizens to be ""especially careful"" on Tuesday and Wednesday. ""There is an increased threat of missile attacks and other provocations -- both inside the country and outside,"" said Andrii Yusov, a spokesperson for the Defense Intelligence service of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. ""They are crazy about dates and symbols, so it would be quite logical to be on guard and be prepared for the fact that Independence Day will also be attacked. Ukraine is ready for this,"" he continued. ""The air raid alarm is a serious signal, that everyone should take into account. Especially on August 23 and 24 -- these are not just words, you have to be especially careful,"" Yusov added. In Kyiv, the city military administration issued a ban on all big gatherings between Monday and Thursday, saying ""it is forbidden to hold mass events, peaceful meetings, rallies and other events related to a large gathering of people."" Gen. Mykola Zhyrnov, head of Kyiv's military administration, said the order was imposed so that security forces could respond in a ""timely manner to threats of missile and bomb attacks by the troops of the Russian Federation on decision-making centers, military facilities, defense industry facilities, critical infrastructure and nearby residential areas."" Last week, the State Department said it summoned Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov to a meeting so the United States ""could warn Russia against any escalation of its war on Ukraine,"" a department spokesperson said Monday. This included calling on Russia to ""cease all military operations at or near Ukraine's nuclear facilities and to return full control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant to Ukraine,"" the official added. The town of Nikopol across the river from the occupied plant suffered shelling on Ukraine's Day of the National Flag on Tuesday, a local official said. Yevhen Yevtushenko, the head of Nikopol district military administration, warned locals to avoid mass gatherings, open areas and infrastructure facilities through Thursday. Kyiv and Moscow have made a barrage of accusations against each other about security and military action at and around the plant, the largest nuclear complex in Europe. But the lack of independent access to the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March, makes it impossible to verify what is happening there. Recent satellite images from Maxar Technologies of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant show no signs of ""systemic shelling,"" despite claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin that the Ukrainian military was conducting repeated military strikes at the facility. Tensions in the war spiked this week with the death of Darya Dugina, a Russian political commentator and the daughter of prominent ultranationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin. Russia has blamed Ukrainian special services for her killing, according to Russian state news agency TASS. ""The murder of journalist Darya Dugina has been solved, it was prepared by the Ukrainian special services, by a citizen of Ukraine,"" TASS reported, citing Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), which named a woman as the perpetrator and said she had fled to Estonia after the attack. Ukraine has denied any involvement in Dugina's killing, calling the FSB claims fiction. Dugina, the editor of a Russian disinformation website, died after a bomb planted in a car she was driving went off on the outskirts of Moscow on Saturday evening. Dugina's father, Alexander Dugin, is a prominent Russian nationalist credited with being the architect or ""spiritual guide"" of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.",3,4.716792620415165,6.1025553885507335,-1.3857627681355682,7

Two weeks ago, Pavel Filatyev spoke out against the conflict in a 141-page-long testimony posted to his VKontakte social media page, then fled Russia. He is the first serving member of the Russian military to publicly criticize the invasion of Ukraine and leave the country. Now he tells CNN that his fellow troops as tired, hungry and disillusioned -- and that the Kremlin's war effort is ""destroying peaceful lives."" ""We understood that we were dragged into a serious conflict where we are simply destroying towns and not actually liberating anyone,"" Filatyev told CNN's Matthew Chance. CNN is not disclosing the location of the interview for the security of the interviewee. ""Many understood that we do not see the reason that our government is trying to explain to us. That all of it is a lie,"" he said. ""We are just destroying peaceful lives. This fact immensely influenced our morale. That feeling that we are not doing anything good."" Filatyev, 33, told CNN ""corruption"" and repression are rife in his home country and said his unit -- which was based in Crimea and sent to Ukraine entering Kherson early in the conflict -- was ill-equipped and given little explanation for Russia's invasion. According to Filatyev, the soldiers and their commanders did not know what they were expected to do in Ukraine. He added that they soon became disillusioned with the government's reasoning for its invasion after arriving in Kherson and facing resistance from locals who did not want to be ""liberated."" The paratrooper served in Russia's 56th air assault regiment and was also involved in efforts to capture the city of Mykolaiv. He was evacuated from the front lines because of an injury. He told CNN the Russian army lacked basic equipment, as well as drones and other types of unmanned aircraft during his stint on the front line. ""Our barracks are about 100 years old and are not able to host all of our servicemen ... all of our weapons are from the times of Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Several days after we encircled Kherson many of us did not have any food, water or sleeping sacks on them,"" he said. ""Because it was very cold at night, we couldn't even sleep. We would find some rubbish, some rags, just to wrap ourselves to keep warm."" The capture of Kherson was a significant early military success for Russia. Ukraine is now battling to regain the city as fighting increasingly shifts to the country's south. But Filatyev said he struggles to understand the vision of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion of Ukraine nearly six months ago and has seen his troops locked in a grinding, costly conflict. ""Now that I am out of there and without a gun, I think this is the worst, stupidest thing our government could have done,"" he said. ""I do not know where the government is leading us. What is the next step? Nuclear war?"" ""I see what is happening to my country and I am terrified. Everything is destroyed, corrupted,"" he told CNN. ""The only laws that function well are repressive ones."" Filatyev fled Russia after conducting some initial media interviews. But he suggested the Kremlin could take revenge for his public position. ""I will either be put in prison ... or they will just silence me by taking me out. There were a lot of cases like that in the past,"" he said. ""I do not see any other way out. If it happens, it happens.""",14,6.95515120530192,4.130604096303146,2.8245471089987744,20

Ukraine has denied any involvement in Dugina's killing, calling the FSB claims fiction. ""We have nothing to do with the murder of this lady -- this is the work of the Russian special services,"" said Oleksii Danylov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security Council, in an interview on Ukrainian television Monday. ""I emphasize once again that our special services have nothing to do with this,"" he said. Dugina, the editor of a Russian disinformation website, died after a bomb planted in a car she was driving went off in the outskirts of Moscow on Saturday evening. The FSB said that the assailant was a Ukrainian woman who arrived in Russia on July 23 with her young daughter, TASS reported. The pair attended a festival on Saturday near Moscow where Dugina was a guest of honor. ""The criminals used a Mini Cooper car to monitor the journalist,"" TASS reported, citing the FSB, adding that the woman had rented an apartment in Moscow in the same building where Dugina lived. After remotely detonating explosives planted in Dugina's Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, the FSB said the woman and her daughter drove through the Pskov region to Estonia, roughly a 12-hour journey. CNN cannot independently verify the FSB claims cited by the TASS report. Estonia's Police and Border Guard said Monday it only shares cross-border movement information ""in cases as determined by the law"" and not because of Russian accusations in the media. The agency's media representative Ragne Keisk also told CNN in an email that the border force had ""not received any formal information or request from the Russian authorities on this topic."" The Estonian Foreign Ministry said it could not comment and directed inquiries to the country's Justice Ministry and Border Guard. Mykhailo Podolyak, a key adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said on Monday that the FSB accusation was reflective of the ""fictional world"" in which Russian propaganda thrives. ""Ru-propaganda lives in a fictional world: [Ukrainian] woman and her 12-year-old child were 'assigned' responsible for blowing up the car of propagandist Dugina. Surprisingly, they did not find the 'Estonian visa' on the spot,"" he said on Twitter. Ukrainian Defense Intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov also rejected Russia's claims on Monday as ""fake."" ""It is a fake that Ukraine is involved in this. It is a fake that the National Guard of Ukraine is involved in these events. The National Guard is fulfilling its legal tasks at the territory of Ukraine,"" Yusov said in a statement. Yusov then redirected responsibility for the blast back on Russia, saying: ""This looks more like sorting things out within Russia. Both Dugin and his daughter are marginal characters and not a point of interest to Ukraine."" Dugina's father, Alexander Dugin, is a prominent Russian nationalist credited with being the architect or ""spiritual guide"" of President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. At a memorial service on Tuesday, Dugin said his daughter ""died for our victory, our Russian victory, for the sake of the Orthodoxy of our country, our state."" ""She had no fear, and the last thing she said, when we talked at the Festival of Tradition, she said to me: 'Dad, I feel like a warrior, I feel like a hero. I want to be like this, I don't want any other fate. I want to be with my people, with my country,'"" Dugin continued. Both father and daughter have been sanctioned by the United States and the United Kingdom for acting to destabilize Ukraine. The US Treasury sanctioned Dugina in March as the chief editor for the disinformation website United World International, which it claimed was owned by Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin and pushed messages suggesting Ukraine would ""perish"" if it was admitted to NATO. Prigozhin, known as ""Putin's chef,"" is believed to be behind the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the notorious Kremlin-linked troll factory accused of meddling in the 2016 US election. The UK, in a July filing by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, called Dugina a ""frequent and high-profile contributor of disinformation in relation to Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on various online platforms."" Putin on Monday sent his condolences to Dugina's family, calling her death ""a vile, cruel crime."" In a statement published on the Kremlin's Telegram channel, Putin said: ""A journalist, scientist, philosopher, war correspondent, she honestly served the people, the Fatherland, she proved by deed what it means to be a patriot of Russia.""",3,4.873569315291844,2.7327060074429403,2.1408633078489037,3

Zelensky said on Saturday that Russia might be planning ""particularly ugly"" attacks to coincide with the occasion, which will mark 31 years since Ukraine broke its ties with the Soviet Union and as the war nears its six-month milestone. ""We must all be aware that this week Russia could try to do something particularly ugly, something particularly vicious,"" Zelensky said in a video message. ""One of the key tasks of the enemy is to humiliate us, Ukrainians, to devalue our capabilities, our heroes, to spread despair, fear, to spread conflicts ... Therefore, it is important never, for a single moment, to give in to this enemy pressure, not to wind oneself up, not to show weakness,"" he said. In Kyiv, the city military administration issued a ban on all big gatherings between Monday and Thursday, saying ""it is forbidden to hold mass events, peaceful meetings, rallies and other events related to a large gathering of people.""

2022-08-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/europe/ukraine-kherson-russia-bridge-strikes-intl/index.html,"Russian troops in south Ukraine squeezed as Kyiv ramps up strikes on bridges, ammo depots","Russian forces in the occupied Kherson region in southern Ukraine are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the flow of ammunition, armor and fuel to front-line units, according to Ukrainian officials and Western analysts, thanks to a concerted Ukrainian campaign to cut off river and rail supply lines as well as target ammunition depots. Ukrainian officials say the Russians are moving command posts from the north of the Dnipro River to the south bank as bridges have been heavily damaged. The first deputy head of Kherson regional council, Yuri Sobolevsky, claimed on his Telegram channel that a significant portion of the Russian military command had already left Kherson city. Ukrainian forces are about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) north of the city, towards Mykolaiv. Much of Kherson region has been occupied since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As part of Kyiv's counteroffensive to try to retake lost territory in the south, Ukrainian forces are targeting critical bridges to disrupt supply routes in and around Kherson. The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based think tank, said Sunday that the Russians may be leaving for the other side of the river ""to avoid being trapped in Kherson city if Ukrainian strikes cut off all ground lines of communication connecting the right bank of the Dnipro River to the Russian rear."" Videos have appeared on social media in the past few days showing renewed long-range artillery attacks on the Antonivskyi bridge and a road bridge over the dam near Nova Kakhovka, rendering them impassable for heavily armored vehicles. In some areas, the river is up to 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) wide, making pontoon bridges impractical. The Ukrainians have also targeted several railway lines from the Russian-occupied Crimea Peninsula into the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. On Tuesday, a series of fierce explosions rocked the town of Dzankhoy on the main line towards Kherson. Recent video showed a substantial stock of military vehicles and ammunition at the site. Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of occupied Melitopol, said on Ukrainian television Monday that Russian forces were still clearing rubble from the site of a railway bridge near the city that had been hit last Friday. ""Currently, the enemy uses Melitopol as a logistics center for the transportation, trans-shipment of ammunition and heavy weapons. The enemy transports most of the ammunition by rail,"" he added. Fedorov, who is no longer in Melitopol, also claimed Monday: ""We see the migration of [Russian] military personnel from Kherson to Melitopol. Military personnel take their families out of Melitopol."" Fedorov says he gets information from partisan networks in the city. Two railway lines from Crimea were struck in the last 10 days. Last week, local residents reported several hours of explosions in the Henichesk district, a port area along the Sea of Azov, and the railway further west at Brylivka was also struck. According to the Ukrainian military's Operational Command South: ""Within the last week we have destroyed over 10 ammunition warehouses and military equipment clusters. These hits do not allow for the heavy equipment to be transferred by these bridges."" None of this suggests an imminent Russian withdrawal from Kherson. Russia has established strong, layered defenses, including air cover, in the Kherson region, according to Western military analysts, even using vintage T-62 Soviet battle tanks as stationary artillery pieces to provide defensive support. They have also attempted regular counter-attacks against Ukrainian units trying to push south into Kherson, essentially restricting them to modest gains in the flat farmlands along the border with Mykolaiv region. But the Russians require a constant flow of munitions and fuel to sustain their operations in the region. And bridges and railroads are easy targets. Now that the United States has supplied them with anti-radar HARMS missiles, the Ukrainians have begun using combat aircraft and helicopters in the region, as well as highly accurate long-range artillery systems. Their targeting is also aided by a nascent resistance movement within occupied areas. The Ukrainians have recognized that going toe-to-toe with Russian forces in a gruelling battle of artillery and tanks is far less fruitful than using their newly acquired tools -- and some older ones -- to hit Russian rear positions and infrastructure.",14,5.011566983782,1.909734684560039,3.101832299221961,21
2022-08-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/europe/crimea-explosion-ammunition-depot-tuesday-intl/index.html,Russia blames sabotage as blasts rock another military facility in Crimea,"A blast at an ammunition depot in the village of Maiskoye in Crimea injured at least two people, local authorities said Tuesday, in the second incident in a week to rock the Russian-controlled peninsula. Russia's ministry of defense has blamed sabotage for the Tuesday morning explosions and damage to the military facility in the Dzhankoi area of northern Crimea, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Around 2,000 residents in the area were evacuated, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported, and train services from Russia into Crimea were suspended. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the incident, but Mykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, tweeted that: ""Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouses explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves. Demilitarization in action."" Last Tuesday, a series of explosions damaged at least eight aircraft and infrastructure at a Russian military air base in Novofedorivka, on Crimea's west coast. The Russian defense ministry statement did not clarify how much military equipment and ammunition may have been destroyed in the latest incident. Footage of the facility posted on social media last week showed large ammunition stacks and several military vehicles with ""Z"" markings, a Russian pro-war symbol. The explosions at the depot were caused by a fire, the head of the Crimea administration Sergei Aksyonov said in his Telegram channel, citing the Russian ministry of defense, adding the detonations were still ongoing. ""The evacuation of residents is underway, people are taken out of the five-kilometer zone from the incident to ensure safety,"" Aksyonov said, adding that defense ministry officials, military service members and emergency services are involved. Ukrainian presidential adviser Podolyak later said a nearby substation that was being used to divert power from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant had also affected by explosions at the depot. ""You must understand that they stole from the Zaporizhzhia NPP in order to send electricity to Crimea through Dzhankoi,"" Podolyak said later in a televised interview. ""I think and believe that this is karmic retribution. Everything that is stolen does not bring wealth."" CNN could not independently verify Podolyak's claim that power from the Zaporizhzhia station was being diverted to Crimea via Dzhankoi. The plant, the largest nuclear complex of its kind in Europe, is located in southern Ukraine and was captured by Russian forces in the early days of the invasion. In recent days it has become the focal point of growing global concern over the potential for a nuclear disaster, after increased shelling triggered calls for international experts to visit the facility. The explosion at Maiskoye is the second security incident at a military installation in Crimea in the past week. Last Tuesday, the blasts at the Novofedorivka Russian air base destroyed at least eight Russian military aircraft, satellite imagery reviewed by CNN showed. The explosions also killed one person and injured 14, according to the Crimean health ministry. The Russian defense ministry said that incident was caused by the accidental detonation of ammunition. Ukraine did not publicly claim responsibility for the incident. Podolyak said Moscow's explanations for the Tuesday blasts, as well as of the explosions last week, suggested the Russian military was deploying ""untrained"" staff to some locations. In his nightly video message on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Ukrainians living in occupied areas to stay clear of Russian forces' military facilities. ""I am asking now all our people in Crimea, in other areas, in the south of the country, in the occupied areas of Donbas and Kharkiv region to be very careful,"" he said. ""Please do not go near the military facilities of the Russian army and all those places where they store ammunition and equipment, where they keep their headquarters."" Following the explosion in Maiskoye, train services from Russia into Crimea were suspended across most of the occupied peninsula. Aksyonov, the head of the Crimea administration, later said on Telegram that ""damaged railroad tracks in the Dzhankoi area have been restored."" ""Train traffic on this section will be resumed after the completion of all necessary safety measures,"" he added. Dzhankoi sits on a train line connecting Crimea to Melitopol. According to several Ukrainian officials, the line is regularly used to transport military equipment to the front lines. Referring to long queues of traffic seen leaving Crimea for Russia after last week's attack, Zelesnky said on Tuesday: ""The queue these days to leave Crimea for Russia via the bridge proves that the absolute majority of citizens of the terrorist state already understand or at least feel that Crimea is not a place for them.

2022-08-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/14/europe/ukraine-frontline-analysis-robertson-intl-cmd/index.html,A three-week drive around Ukraine's front lines taught me this: The tide of the war is unlikely to turn any time soon,"There are many observations to be made about Ukraine. But on a recent road trip, one sticks out -- just how vast the country is. Three weeks of driving from south to east in this sprawling country through front line villages, towns, past trenches and along hedgerows which are this wars strategic equivalent of high ground, is an education, and one that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use. Almost six months on, the disastrous war that he launched is stagnating. Scenes reminiscent of World War I trench warfare and its associated incremental gains and death are taking hold. The almost 1,000-mile-long battle front Putin opened has hardened, but the country behind is deep, and for the most part unscathed. Thirty miles from the front, city lawns are still being mowed, while many hundreds of miles away in the capital Kyiv, fancy restaurants have reopened, where fine wines and chilled champagnes are available, and fresh caught Mediterranean fish is on the menu. This is a fat land, with fertile farms and proud crops rich from rain and sun. If strategic depth is what's behind the front lines, Ukraine has an untapped wealth available. Perhaps most striking is the number of military age males across the country who are not yet committed to the fight. Ukraine is at war, but not yet it seems, all in. Only some of Ukraine's potential fighting force are in bunkers buried in tree lines overlooking Russian forces. Cobblers, authors, artists, teachers, businessmen, journalists, even a former McDonalds franchise CEO, are holding back Putin's push, but when the government needs it there are many more who can be called on. The big takeaway is, that this is not a war that's going to be over fast, not is even clear yet if the real defining fight has begun. Reality on the ground No front line position can really be measured day-by-day, but over weeks of travel and many many conversations, a reality emerges. The war is settling into a slower phase where the contours of what's contested are becoming clear, but the detail on any given day shifts. Tree lines that border the huge fields here are favored by both sides to stay hidden from drones and the strikes that follow once spotted, but the massive fields often dictate front lines a mile apart. The result less likelihood of positions shifting. Troops on some fronts in the east told CNN they'd seen as many as half of Russia's troops pulled out of the fight, yet just a handful of miles away amid a cacophony of artillery, grad rockets, anti-aircraft gunfire, heavy machine guns and small arms, Russia seems all in. And along lines in the south, Ukrainian troops told us they'd seen Russians bulking up, pushing more forces in. Ukrainian officials say they're expecting a Russian advance and have built up a counter-narrative they'll retake Kherson, one of the first cities to fall in early March, as Russia ramps up strikes on Mykolaiv. Logically Kherson is the obvious first big grab, most Russian forces are on the other side of the Dniper river making it a vulnerable bridgehead valued by both sides. But the reality on the ground is that we saw no buildup of Ukrainian forces. In fact, quite the opposite: huge expanses near the front were devoid of soldiers. They weren't hiding in the trees either; roads seemed virtually untouched by heavy-tracked fighting vehicles or tanks, with no tell-tale mud on the road or any sign troops were moving in numbers. Russia lied its way in to this war, lied to the world it wouldn't invade, and lied to itself an easy victory awaited. It may now also be victim of a carefully curated lie, or information operation sowing false information about Ukrainian intentions. Hype about a Ukraine's southern offensive maybe nothing more than that, a trick causing Russia to redeploy forces from the east to the south. What hasn't changed, despite the influx of Western weapon systems like the US HIMARS, and M777, British MLRS and Polish KRABS, Russia still outmans and outguns Ukraine by about five to one. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky says there won't be peace until Russia leaves all occupied territory including Crimea, which they annexed in 2014. He'll need an army to do it, but not the hodge-podge of regulars and volunteers that he has at his disposal today. Today cellphones often substitute for secure radios, flip flops for combat boots, friendships for formal command structures. One volunteer drone commander said he calls his artillery buddy on an unencrypted mobile phone, not a secure radio or data channel, when he spots a good target. In a more joined-up military structure the artillery commander would see the drone feed live. Ukraine's army won't give up an inch without a fight, but while its volunteer army has impressed the world and surprised the invading forces with their determination and resilience, reclaiming lost territory would cost less blood with a more integrated and professional force. Time and again along the front line troops told us when they lay down fire on Russian forces the enemy's guns go silent. Western help is buying respite but not a lasting reprieve from the threat. Soldiers' pale faces and distant stares told us just how much time they spend sheltering in spade-dug, damp, claustrophobic holes wondering if the next incoming rocket will be their last. Unless you've experienced this bombardment, it's easy to understate how harrowing the constant danger is -- for both soldiers and civilians. It eats into sleep, stretches time, collapses concentration. Senses shut down, many impervious to the detonations, only diving for cover when an explosion is particularly close. That's the life we found in many towns and villages in the wide ribbons of contested territory, the closer to the front the greater the danger. Like scenes from WW1, citizens scavenge wood from bombed wreckage of neighbors' houses, they cook outside because they have no gas, electricity or water. Imagine a winter like this? Soon, we won't have to, the cold months are coming, hardships and deprivations will multiply. Local hospitals are clearing wards ready to treat more victims. Russia is increasingly targeting civilians with illegal cluster bombs, significantly driving up the number of causalities and spreading terror.

2022-08-09,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/europe/crimea-blasts-russian-base-intl/index.html,Explosions rock area of Russian airbase in Crimea killing at least one,"One person has died and multiple others were injured in a series of large explosions that rocked the area of a Russian military airbase in the annexed Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on Tuesday, local authorities have said. Footage from the scene showed large plumes of smoke billowing into the air. The Russian defense ministry said the blasts had been caused by detonated aviation ammunition, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported. ""Around 3:20 p.m., several aviation munitions detonated on the territory of the airfield 'Saki' near the settlement of Novofedorivka,"" the ministry said in the statement, according to RIA Novosti. Earlier on Tuesday Kоnstantin Skorupsky, Minister of Health of the Republic of Crimea, said five people were injured following the explosions. It is not clear if the person who died was among those previously reported as injured. Ambulance crews and an air ambulance were sent to the site of the explosions, according to the health ministry. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and considers Crimea part of its territory. Kyiv and its allies do not recognize the annexation and consider the peninsula Ukrainian territory under Russian occupation. Oleg Kryuchkov, adviser to the head of the Crimean region, confirmed several explosions had occurred near the village of Novofedorivka. In a statement posted on his Telegram channel later in the afternoon, Kryuchkov said around 30 people living nearby were evacuated from their homes following the explosions, and that an air cordon had been set up around the perimeter of the airfield. Separately, Sergey Aksenov, the head of the so-called Republic of Crimea, said ""I went to the scene in the village of Novofedorivka, Saki district. The circumstances are being clarified."" He said there was ""a dispersion of fragments"" at the scene and that emergency crews were working the site. ""Measures were taken to set up a cordon perimeter in a 5-kilometer zone: fences, traffic police crews and foot patrols in order to prevent injuries to local residents,"" he added. There was no word from the Ukrainian side about any possible attacks in the area. Ukraine is not known to have struck the territory of Crimea since the Russian invasion began. The explosions came just hours after the Ukrainian military carried out what appeared to have been their deepest strike yet into Russian occupied regions in southern Ukraine near the Crimean peninsula. Serhii Khlan, adviser to the head of Kherson Civil Military Administration, said on Ukrainian television Tuesday, ""This morning there was a good news, there was a very powerful detonation in Henichesk region."" Henichesk is in the southern Kherson region and about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the nearest Ukrainian front line. Khlan suggested that the target had been on the railway between Henichesk and Melitopol. ""We are still waiting for the official confirmation of our Armed Forces, from the General Staff, but it's a very pleasant news. The detonation was heard during 1.5-2 hours on this railway station, which connects Crimea and Melitopol,"" he said. Creating a land corridor connecting Crimea to Russia through occupied areas in southern and eastern Ukraine was one of the goals of Russia's invasion. Moscow said in June that it had accomplished that goal and that the Russian military had ""restored"" 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) of train tracks and opened roads to allow ""full-fledged traffic"" between Russia, eastern Ukraine's Donbas region and Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russian forces from Ukraine in 2014. The supply of water through the North Crimean Canal -- a lifeline for Crimea -- had also resumed, Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoigu said.",17,4.194707998335134,5.270104616957249,-1.0753966186221149,14
2022-08-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/europe/amnesty-ukraine-military-report-intl/index.html,"Amnesty regrets 'distress' caused by report on Ukrainian military, but stands by findings","Amnesty International said it ""deeply regrets the distress and anger"" caused by a report the group published on the Ukrainian military's fighting tactics, but added that it ""fully"" stands by the findings, which concluded those tactics violated international humanitarian law. The human rights watchdog published a press release last week accusing Ukrainian forces of putting civilians in harm's way by setting up military bases in residential areas, including schools and hospitals and launching attacks from populated civilian areas. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lashed out at the group's report, arguing that it tried to ""shift the responsibility"" of civilian deaths in Ukraine away from Russia. The report sparked the resignation of the head of Amnesty in Ukraine, Oksana Pokalchuk, who said she had tried to dissuade the organization from publishing the report as it appeared. ""If you don't live in a country occupied by invaders that are tearing it to pieces, you probably don't understand what it's like to condemn an ​​army of defenders,"" Pokalchuk said in a statement on Facebook. ""Such important reports, which are published at such a moment and in such a context, cannot fail to contain information about the other side of the war, about the one who started this war,"" she added. ""The organization created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives. Seeking to protect civilians, this research instead became a tool of Russian propaganda."" Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also hit out at the report, tweeting that it ""distorts reality, draws false moral equivalence between the aggressor and the victim, and boosts Russia's disinformation efforts."" Following the backlash, Amnesty said in a statement to CNN Sunday: ""While we fully stand by our findings, we regret the pain caused and wish to clarify a few crucial points."" The watchdog reiterated that it had ""documented how in all 19 of the towns and villages we visited, we found instances where Ukrainian forces had located themselves right next to where civilians were living, thereby potentially putting them at risk from incoming Russian fire."" ""We made this assessment based on the rules of international humanitarian law (IHL), which require all parties to a conflict to avoid locating, to the maximum extent feasible, military objectives within or near densely populated areas. The laws of war exist in part to protect civilians, and it is for this reason that Amnesty International urges governments to comply with them,"" the watchdog said. ""This does not mean that Amnesty International holds Ukrainian forces responsible for violations committed by Russian forces, nor that the Ukrainian military is not taking adequate precautions elsewhere in the country,"" it said. Experts not associated with Amnesty have found that patterns of violent acts by Russian forces in Ukraine meet the qualification of crimes against humanity. ""We must be very clear: Nothing we documented Ukrainian forces doing in any way justifies Russian violations,"" Amnesty said. ""Russia alone is responsible for the violations it has committed against Ukrainian civilians. Amnesty's work over the last six months and our multiple briefings and reports on Russia's violations and war crimes reflect their scale and the gravity of their impact on civilians."" Amnesty said it reached out to the Ukrainian government on July 29 detailing the findings. ""In our letter, we included GPS coordinates and other sensitive information about the locations, including schools and hospitals, where we had documented Ukrainian forces basing themselves among civilians. We did not make this information public in our press release due to the security risks it would pose to both Ukrainian forces and to the civilians we interviewed,"" the watchdog said. ""Amnesty International is not attempting to give the Ukrainian military detailed instructions regarding how they should operate -- but we call on the relevant authorities to abide by their international humanitarian obligations in full,"" Amnesty said. ""Amnesty International's priority will always be ensuring that civilians' lives and human rights are protected during conflict."" In his comments on Thursday, Zelensky accused Amnesty of handing a propaganda victory to Moscow. ""We saw today a completely different report from Amnesty International, which, unfortunately, tries to amnesty the terrorist state and shift the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim,"" Zelensky said. ""This is such immoral selectivity,"" he added. ""Anyone who amnesties Russia and who artificially creates a such informational context where some attacks by terrorists are supposedly justified or supposedly understandable cannot fail to understand that, in doing so, they are helping the terrorists.""",13,6.9257134307128885,2.2056274136653284,4.72008601704756,5
2022-08-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/russia-ukraine-prison-attack/index.html,White House says Russia planning to falsify evidence to frame Ukrainian forces for prison attack,"US officials believe Russia is preparing to falsify evidence to blame Ukrainian forces for last week's deadly blast at the Olenivka prison ahead of visits to the site by outside parties. An administration official told CNN they expect Russia will falsify evidence, blame Ukrainian forces, and even have ""reason to believe that Russia would go so far as to make it appear that Ukrainian HIMARS were to blame before journalists arrive."" John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, confirmed that reporting Thursday. ""We anticipate that Russian officials will try to frame the Ukrainian Armed Forces in anticipation of journalists and potential investigators visiting the site of the attack,"" Kirby said. ""In fact, we've already seen some spurious press reports to this effect, where they have planted evidence. We have reason to believe that Russia would go so far as to make it appear that Ukrainian HIMARS -- the high mobility advanced rocket systems that have been so much in the news lately -- were to blame."" ""And to do that before journalists arrived on site, and again, we're beginning to even start to see some press reporting to that effect,"" Kirby told CNN's Jeremy Diamond when asked for further information on the reported plan to falsify evidence. The US supplied Ukraine with the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system earlier this year. The US believes Russia has collected large quantities of HIMARS fragments from strikes against its positions in Ukraine and is likely to deliberately place them at sites such as the prison to claim Ukraine was responsible, according to an administration official familiar with the latest information. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday the attack on the prison in separatist-held eastern Ukraine, which resulted in the deaths of at least 50 prisoners, was ""a deliberate war crime by the Russians."" Russia, meanwhile, blamed Ukraine for the attack. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Thursday reiterated the Russian claim that the Ukrainian military was responsible for the attack. ""There is evidence here and there is nothing to hide here,"" he told CNN. ""Moreover, you know that the Russian side proposed to the UN and invited the Red Cross to get acquainted with this evidence on the spot, to conduct the necessary exhaustive investigation."" The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed Wednesday it had been able to visit the Olenivka facility only once -- in May this year to deliver water tanks. ""But we did not have access to POWs held there on an individual basis -- as per ICRC's modalities of work in detention facilities -- and that continues to be the case,"" it said. The ICRC added: ""Under the Third Geneva Convention, during international armed conflicts, the ICRC must be granted access to all PoWs, wherever they are held. We also have full liberty to choose the places we wish to visit. Since February 2022, our teams have been able to have access to some PoWs, but not all."" The ICRC says it has requested access to the detention center again since the attack last week, but has not received permission from the Russians. The Olenivka prison near Donetsk has been used to house many of the Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol several months ago. CNN could not independently verify the allegations of either side. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in a Wednesday news conference that the UN is seeking to establish a fact-finding team to study the attack following requests from both Russia and Ukraine to investigate. He added that the terms of reference for the panel would need to be accepted by Russia and Ukraine before the fact-finding mission would begin. Video aired on Russian networks and shared on social media channels in Donetsk show extensive destruction to a building and several bodies. CNN was able to geolocate footage of the strike to an industrial area about two miles outside the frontline town of Olenivka. The Ukrainian military said the explosion took place on the territory of the industrial zone, in a newly-constructed building specially equipped to hold prisoners taken out of Azovstal. The Ukrainian prosecutor's office has launched an investigation into the strike. In a statement, it said pretrial preliminary data shows ""the occupying state struck the territory of penal colony No. 120 in the temporarily occupied Olenivka village of Volnovakha district of Donetsk region."" Donetsk and Luhansk are the two regions that together form Donbas, the eastern part of Ukraine where the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists started in 2014. The area has become the centerpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin's military ambition in Ukraine after his troops failed to take over Kyiv earlier this year. The Russian military has kept up a persistent barrage of artillery and missile strikes across the region for several weeks. The Kremlin says the goal of what it calls its ""special military operation"" is to take control of both Luhansk and Donetsk.

2022-08-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/senate-vote-nato-finland-sweden/index.html,Senate votes to ratify NATO membership for Sweden and Finland,"The Senate voted on Wednesday to approve a resolution to ratify membership for Sweden and Finland in NATO, a historic vote aimed at strengthening the defense bloc amid Russia's war in Ukraine. NATO formalized its invitation to Sweden and Finland to join the alliance at the end of June and the decision must go to the 30 member states' parliaments and legislatures for final ratification. President Joe Biden sent the protocols for ratification to the Senate in July, paving the way for the vote, which needed to be approved by two-thirds of the Senate to succeed. The final tally of the Senate vote was 95 to 1, with GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri voting in opposition and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voting present. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Tuesday that the vote to approve the resolution of ratification for Sweden and Finland's application to NATO would take place and said that he had invited the ambassadors from Finland and Sweden to join in the gallery during debate and votes. ""Our NATO alliance is the bedrock that has guaranteed democracy in the western world since the end of World War II. This strengthens NATO even further and is particularly needed in light of recent Russian aggression,"" Schumer said in remarks from the Senate floor. ""When Leader McConnell and I met with the Finnish President and Swedish Prime Minister in May, we committed to do this as fast as we could and certainly before we go home for the August recess,"" Schumer said. Once the Senate approves Sweden and Finland's NATO accession protocols, ""the next step in the ratification process is for the President to sign an instrument of ratification of the treaty,"" a State Department spokesperson told CNN. ""Once the President has signed an instrument of ratification, that instrument is deposited (in the case of a multilateral treaty) with the treaty's depositary,"" which in the case of NATO, is the Department, the spokesperson said. These steps will not happen on the same day that the Senate approves, and the final arrangements for depositing the instrument of ratification have not yet been made, the spokesperson told CNN. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted in remarks on the floor on Wednesday ahead of the vote that it would be, ""as decisive as it is bipartisan."" McConnell argued that admitting Sweden and Finland to NATO will ""only strengthen the most successful military alliance in human history."" McConnell also used his floor time to take aim at lawmakers who do not support the resolution. ""If any senator is looking for a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish them good luck,"" he said. ""This is a slam dunk for national security that deserves unanimous bipartisan support."" Sweden and Finland both announced their intention to join NATO in May, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused a sudden shift in attitudes toward joining the bloc. The reason most countries join NATO is because of Article 5, which stipulates that all signatories consider an attack on one member an attack against all. Article 5 has been a cornerstone of the alliance since it was founded in 1949 as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. Hawley explained his position on the issue in a recent op-ed in The National Interest titled ""Why I won't Vote to Add Sweden and Finland to NATO."" ""Finland and Sweden want to join the Atlantic Alliance to head off further Russian aggression in Europe,"" he wrote. ""That is entirely understandable given their location and security needs. But America's greatest foreign adversary doesn't loom over Europe. It looms in Asia. I am talking of course about the People's Republic of China. And when it comes to Chinese imperialism, the American people should know the truth: the United States is not ready to resist it. Expanding American security commitments in Europe now would only make that problem worse—and America, less safe."" Paul similarly outlined his position in an op-ed in the American Conservative. ""As for Sweden and Finland, we still need serious, rational, objective debate on the costs and benefits of admitting two historically neutral nations who have such strategic geographic position in relation to Russia,"" he wrote. ""Before the Russian invasion, I would have said no. But given Russian actions, I have shifted from being against their admittance to NATO to neutral on the question, and will as a consequence vote 'present.'""",29,7.452435255896175,6.004667868921343,1.4477673869748315,13

Grain tycoon Oleksiy Vadaturskyy and his wife, Raisa, died in the attack, according to a statement from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Vadaturskyy was the founder of Mykolaiv-based Nibulon, one of Ukraine's largest grain producing and export companies. The businessman's death was a ""great loss for Mykolaiv ... and all of Ukraine,"" Zelensky said. ""For more than 50 years of his career, Oleksiy Vadaturskyy made an invaluable contribution to the development of the region and the development of the agricultural and shipbuilding industries of our country."" Mykolaiv Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said cluster munitions blew out windows and destroyed balconies. ""Mykolaiv was under mass shelling today. Probably the strongest one of all time,"" he said in a statement. A CNN team on the ground heard the explosions caused by the strikes and saw fires that broke out in the shelling. Residents interviewed by CNN also said it was the heaviest shelling in the city since the start of the war. In a speech commemorating Russia's Navy Day in Saint Petersburg, Putin did not make any mention of Russia's war in Ukraine, but said his country's ""current situation is demanding very decisive actions."" ""We will provide protection firmly and by all means. The key here is the capabilities of the Navy, which is able to respond with lightning speed to anyone who decides to encroach on our sovereignty and freedom,"" Putin said. Putin said delivery of the country's Zircon hypersonic cruise missile systems would begin in the coming months. Russia said in May that it successfully tested the Zircon missile over a distance of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles). 'True hero' Vadaturskyy and his wife were sheltering in the basement at home when they were killed in a direct hit that reduced parts of their mansion to debris. It remains unclear whether he was intentionally targeted by the Russians. A statement from Vadaturskyy's company, Nibulon, said he was a ""true hero and patriot"" who had stayed in Mykolaiv to help the strategically important port throughout Russia's invasion. ""He always believed in Ukraine and directed his efforts to its development and prosperity,"" the statement said. Neighbors expressed their shock and anger at the attack. ""We don't know what to do. We hate Russia,"" said Maxim, who has lived in the area for almost 20 years. ""It's unbelievable that in one moment it can destroy everything."" Accusations of war crimes Separately, at least three people were killed and eight injured in fighting in eastern Ukraine, according to the Donetsk military-civilian administration, which said villages in the region were targeted by artillery, Russian Grad missiles and Uragan rockets. ""11 private residential buildings and a high-rise building, a police station, a market, a canteen were damaged, and three fields were burned,"" the administration said. The Ukraine General Staff said Russian forces were attacking the front lines in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Zelensky on Saturday called on the remaining residents of the Donetsk region to urgently evacuate in what he called a ""government decision."" ""Everything is being organized. Full support, full assistance -- both logistical and payments,"" he said in his nightly address. ""We only need a decision from the people themselves, who have not yet made it for themselves."" A strike on a prison in separatist-held eastern Ukraine on Friday resulted in the deaths of at least 40 prisoners. The Olenivka prison near Donetsk has been used to house many of the Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol several months ago. UK Ambassador to Ukraine Melinda Simmons said the strike was part of a pattern ""the worst kind of human rights abuses"" in her twitter on Saturday. ""Olenivka needs investigating. It looks like part of an increasingly worrying pattern of the worst kind of human rights abuses, and possible war crimes, being committed in the occupied East of Ukraine with impunity,"" the ambassador tweeted.

The three videos appear to show a soldier wearing what look like yellow and blue patches -- the colors of the Ukrainian flag -- on the ground, with his hands tied behind his back, first being gagged, then mutilated, then shot. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos which circulated widely on social media after first appearing on a pro-Russian Telegram channel. CNN also has not independently verified the nationality of the perpetrators or the victim. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said it is appalled by the videos. In a statement issued late Friday, the Monitoring Mission said the ""torture and summary executions of prisoners of war and persons hors de combat are war crimes."" The Prosecutor General's office in Ukraine said it has launched a criminal investigation into the matter, ""based on the results of the video processing, which shows how persons in the uniform of servicemen of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are torturing a prisoner in the uniform of a serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Measures are being taken to establish all the circumstances of the crime."" The video that appears to come first shows the victim being gagged surrounded by at least four men, one of whom is wearing what looks like a Russian uniform with the ""Z"" insignia associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A second video shows the same man writhing on the ground as a man wearing blue surgical gloves and what appears to be a Russian uniform cuts off the victim's underwear with a box cutter. The man uses the same box cutter to castrate him, then holds the mutilated genitals up for the camera. In the video, the perpetrators can be heard saying ""hold him, hold him"" in Russian. The third video shows the bound and mutilated man being shot in the head and dragged away. CNN has contacted the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment about the videos. The UN Monitoring Mission said on Facebook it ""is appalled by the latest videos, apparently showing the beating, castration and shooting of a captured soldier from the Ukrainian Armed Forces by a man, who appears to be a member of the Russian armed forces or affiliated armed groups."" ""In one of the videos the tortured soldier appeared to be shot in the head and his body dragged into a ditch. If confirmed, these actions would constitute war crimes."" The UN Monitoring Mission said: ""Unfortunately, this is only the latest in a series of videos that have documented torture and extrajudicial killings of prisoners of war and persons hors de combat, committed by belligerent parties."" ""HRMMU has publicly reported on videos showing Ukrainian soldiers shooting the legs of three captured Russian soldiers and in a separate case shooting and killing an injured Russian soldier,"" the UN Monitoring Mission wrote. It added: ""All parties must refrain from torture, killings and threats of giving no quarter to captured combatants. They must promptly and effectively investigate all allegations of torture and unlawful killings."" High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell on Friday strongly condemned ""Russia's ongoing illegitimate and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine and its people brings further horrific atrocities day by day."" ""Evidence in form of appalling video footage has been widely shared on pro-Kremlin social networks today, in which Russian soldiers commit a heinous atrocity against a Ukrainian prisoner of war,"" Borrell said in a statement. Amnesty International has demanded an investigation into the videos. ""This horrific assault is yet another apparent example of complete disregard for human life and dignity in Ukraine committed by Russian forces. All those suspected of criminal responsibility must be investigated,"" said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International's Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

2022-07-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/europe/russia-recruits-volunteer-battalions-ukraine-war-cmd-intl/index.html,Russia is recruiting thousands of volunteers to replenish its ranks in Ukraine. Prior experience isn't always required,"Across Russia, volunteer battalions are being formed to deploy to the war in Ukraine, joining the so-called ""special military operation"" declared by President Vladimir Putin in February. From Murmansk in the Arctic Circle to Perm in the Urals and Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East, the call has gone out, appealing to both the patriotism and the wallets of Russians. Relevant military experience is not always required. In all, analysts assess that more than 30,000 volunteers might be mobilized to supplement Russian ranks depleted by five months of combat -- between one-quarter and one-third of the force deployed to win the eastern Donbas region, where the majority of volunteers would likely be sent. Last week, Richard Moore, chief of MI6, UK's secret intelligence service, told CNN's Jim Sciutto the ""Russians will increasingly find it difficult to supply manpower, material over the next few weeks."" Putin has long resisted the idea of a general mobilization in Russia, and this spring's call-up was similar to that in 2021. These battalions are one way to augment Russia's military manpower without such a drastic step. They also appear to be focused on poorer and more isolated regions, using the lure of quick cash. What impact these battalions may have is an open question. Chechen volunteer units have played an outsized role in the Donbas campaign, especially in Mariupol. But they are relatively well-equipped and have extensive military experience. The battalions being assembled elsewhere clearly do not. Kateryna Stepanenko, Russia researcher at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, says: ""Some battalions will partake exclusively in combat support and combat support operations (such as logistics or signal battalions), while others will reinforce pre-existing military units or form combat battalions."" But she adds: ""The short-term training is unlikely to turn volunteers with no prior experience into effective soldiers in any unit."" CNN has sought comment from the Russian Defense Ministry on the volunteer battalion program. Patriotism -- and cash Stepanenko says the process is being driven from Moscow. ""The Kremlin reportedly ordered all 85 Russian federal subjects (regions of the Russian Federation plus occupied Crimea and Sevastopol) to recruit volunteer battalions to avoid declaring partial or full mobilization in Russia."" But the regions are expected to help fund the recruitment, which she says ""places a heavy strain on regional budgets."" Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, for example, had to set aside about $2 million for the project, Stepanenko said. The qualifications required for joining up vary from place to place. One online flier in Kazan in Tatarstan said: ""We invite men under the age of 49 years who have previously served in the military and offer a contract for 4 months in your military specialization."" Elsewhere, men up to the age of 60 with no criminal record are eligible. There is often no requirement of previous military experience listed in online notices. The Perm posting -- under the headline ""A Job For Real Men"" -- seeks ""courageous, daring, brave, self-confident, extraordinary, well-rounded patriots of our nation."" According to the postings, about one month is allotted for training -- not much for a situation in which recruits have little or no military experience. According to the Russian Defense Ministry's standard policy, all recruits signing a contract must have four weeks of combined arms training. Whether that same regime is being extended to all volunteers is unclear. Some of the volunteer battalions have already been through the Mulino training ground near Nizhny Novgorod, according to social media posts. The volunteers' contracts tend to be from four months to a year. They promise much higher wages than the average in the Russian regions. For example, the battalions being formed in Perm and the Western Russian region of Kirov offer an income starting from 300,000 rubles monthly (about $5,000), while in Bashkortostan, near the border with Kazakhstan, the minimum is 280,000 rubles. Bashkir Volunteers from Bashkortostan are promised an additional 8,000 rubles a day for combat operations. An announcement circulating on social media channels in Bashkortostan said: ""Over the summer you can easily earn about a million rubles!"" The average monthly wage in these areas is between 30,000 and 45,000 rubles, roughly one-tenth of what a volunteer may get if deployed to the front lines. There are other perks, too. In Perm and Kirov, the children of volunteers are promised preferential admission to universities. Volunteers will be given the status of ""combat veteran,"" granting them a monthly stipend for life and discounts on housing and transport. And there is a scale of compensation for battlefield casualties, in some instances more than 3 million rubles for serious injury. If a volunteer is killed, their family would receive 12.4 million rubles from the federal budget and 2 million from the region. Some volunteers told the online publication Verstka that they are motivated by the wages, so that, for example, they can build a house. Others seem inspired by patriotism; some appear simply to want an adventure. One, named Vitaly, told Verstka: ""I respect the achievements of our ancestors, and it's hard for me to watch them get spat on. And, of course, there is the pleasant bonus in the form of payments the government offers."" Others told Verstka that they were inspired to rid Ukraine of Nazism, an indication of the power of Russian state media, which has relentlessly plugged the notion that Russia's action is to de-Nazify Ukraine. If all the Russian regions each generated a battalion, the cost would be considerable. Kateryna Stepanenko estimates a 400-man unit would cost $1.2 million per month in wages, which she says is expensive given that the program will not produce elite units. From the Arctic to central Asia Chechen volunteers were the first to enter Ukraine soon after the invasion began. The Vostok Battalion saw action in Mariupol, where it was prominently involved in infantry operations. The Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, frequently lionized the Vostok Battalion. At the end of April, Kadyrov said on his Telegram channel that ""hundreds of brave soldiers from different corners of our immense country have decided to become part of the Russian liberation army."" And in May, he said 200 ""goodwill warriors"" were graduating from the Russian University of Special Forces in Gudermes and leaving for Ukraine every week. By some estimates, as many as 8,000 Chechens have gone to fight in Ukraine. They have been heavily involved in the campaigns to take Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. Volunteers from Buryatia in the Russian Far East were also involved early; several have been killed, including one well-known for fighting in Syria. More recently, other Russian regions have stepped up. One prominent case is the republic of Bashkortostan. A retired navy officer, Alik Kamaletdinov, announced on social media he was recruiting for a volunteer battalion because ""Bashkiria has always been a pillar of our state in difficult times. ... Let's support our country and our President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin not by words but by deeds!"" The governor of Bashkortostan, Radiy Habirov, posted on Telegram last week: ""Today we are seeing off the second Bashkir battalion to the Donbas."" ""Thus, more than 800 volunteers, all sons of Bashkortostan, will go to defend our country and brotherly Donbas."" Other regions that have begun raising volunteer battalions include Chelyabinsk in the Urals and Primorsky in the Russian Far East. Photos of nearly 300 Chelyabinsk volunteers were posted last week. The head of the recruitment office in Tatarstan, Evgeniy Tokmakov, said at a news conference that ""battalions should be formed only from natives of Tatarstan, so that they can join the ranks, stand shoulder to shoulder, know each other."" Several units of Cossack fighters are also being formed -- not a surprise given that they were prominently involved in eastern Ukraine in 2014. The Orenburg region has already sent three Cossack battalions to the war. The pace of recruitment is picking up -- within the past few days the regions of Murmansk in the Arctic Circle and Tyumen in Western Siberia announced the formation of volunteer units. 'A crowd with rifles' Just how these battalions -- most are smaller than a regular battalion -- will be integrated into the Russian operation isn't clear yet. The Tatar and Bashkir units will be made into motorized rifle battalions. The volunteer battalion raised in Primorsky Krai will consist only of local residents and will go in support of the 155th Guards Marine Brigade, according to regional authorities. There are signs that Russian manpower shortages in Ukraine are beginning to bite. Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation says it found job vacancies for more than 20,000 Russian contract servicemen at regional employment centers. There have been persistent reports that some battalion tactical groups have had to be reconstituted. But as one analyst puts it, a battalion is more than ""a crowd with rifles."" Stepanenko of the Institute for the Study of War said, ""these poorly-trained recruits will likely be used as cannon fodder given previous Russian treatment of conscripts and proxy units."" It's hard to imagine how these disparate groups with no knowledge of the battlespace and rusty or non-existent military skills will influence the conflict. The task of infantry among Russian forces has been largely to take over places already obliterated by indirect fire. Even so, Stepanenko said, the Russians are ""continuing to take heavy losses without gaining much ground. They therefore require a constant inflow of Russian manpower to make good their losses."" The Ukrainian military is tracking the units' formation. Vadym Skibitskyi, a spokesman for the Main Intelligence Directorate, said Russia is planning to form 16 new battalions by the end of July. He told the online portal Krym.Reali that ""according to our estimates, there will be about 4,000 people in each region, including Crimea."" Skibitskyi confirmed to CNN that his remarks had been accurately reported but declined to provide further details. Stepanenko believes the ultimate aim is a form of mobilization by stealth. ""Putin seems to lack confidence that polls and protestations of support for the war will survive a general conscription effort. Recruitment for volunteer battalions or covert mobilization only affects a small percentage of servicemen and their families,"" Stepanenko said. ""Such separation allows Putin to control the appearance of the invasion without upsetting most of the Russian male population and their families.""",14,6.406665638132338,6.203575559191746,0.20309007894059228,24
2022-07-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/politics/blinken-lavrov-call/index.html,Blinken says he had 'frank' discussion with Russian foreign minister in first call since Ukraine war began,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday for the first time since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine in late February. In what the top US diplomat described as ""a frank and direct conversation,"" Blinken said he ""pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner."" That proposal, which has been on the table since June, includes an offer to swap convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, CNN reported earlier this week. Speaking at a press conference at the State Department, Blinken declined to say whether he thought Russians were more or less likely move on the proposal following the conversation, nor would he describe how Lavrov responded. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday that Lavrov ""strongly suggested"" to Blinken that the United States should return to a mode of ""quiet diplomacy"" regarding a possible prisoner exchange ""without speculative information stuffing."" Blinken, who announced on Wednesday his intention to speak to Lavrov this week, emphasized that he thought it was important that his counterpart hear directly from him. The top US diplomat said he also discussed the expectation that the deal to allow Ukrainian grain to transit safely through the Black Sea be implemented, noting that they're ""looking to see that move forward as soon as possible."" The Russian Foreign Ministry said the two discussed this matter ""in detail,"" with Lavrov blaming US sanctions for complicating the issue ""and US promises to provide appropriate exemptions for Russian food supplies have not yet been fulfilled."" Blinken said he also warned Lavrov against Russia attempting to annex ​more of Ukraine, stressing that the ""world will not recognize annexations"" and ""will impose additional significant costs on Russia if it moves forward with its plans."" In its statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Lavrov told Blinken that Moscow's ""goals and objectives"" in the war in Ukraine ""will be fully implemented."" According to a senior State Department official, the call took place shortly after noon Washington time and lasted roughly 25 minutes. Earlier on Friday, Lavrov downplayed the prospects of the call taking place that day, and also suggested that the matter of the detained Americans should be discussed through other channels. ""Obviously it is unlikely to happen today, but in the coming days we will offer our American colleagues a suitable date,"" the Russian Foreign Minister said during a visit to Uzbekistan. ""If we are talking about an exchange of prisoners, about an exchange of people who are detained in Russia and the United States, we have already commented on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that this topic was considered more than a year ago at the Geneva meeting in June 2021 between Presidents Putin and Biden,"" Lavrov noted, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. ""There, they agreed to authorize the competent people to deal with these issues. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not one of them. But still, I will listen to what he has to say,"" he said. Prior to the call between Blinken and Lavrov, US officials had expressed frustration at Moscow's lack of substantive response to the proposal to free Whelan and Griner. State Department spokesperon Ned Price on Thursday acknowledged ""this has not moved to the extent we would like.""",29,5.299173354491639,5.1296406179328145,0.16953273655882484,26
2022-07-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/europe/donetsk-prison-strike-ukraine-russia-intl/index.html,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says prison attack 'deliberate war crime by the Russians,' as Russia blames Ukraine","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday the attack on a prison in separatist-held eastern Ukraine, which resulted in the deaths of at least 40 prisoners, was ""a deliberate war crime by the Russians."" Russia, meanwhile, blamed Ukraine for the attack. The Olenivka prison near Donetsk has been used to house many of the Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol several months ago. CNN could not independently verify the allegations of either side. ""The occupiers' attack on Olenivka is a deliberate war crime by the Russians, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,"" Zelensky said in a statement. ""There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a terrorist state. Russia has proven with numerous terrorist attacks that it is the biggest source of terrorism in today's world,"" The Ukrainian president added. Video aired on Russian networks and shared on social media channels in Donetsk show extensive destruction to a building and several bodies. CNN was able to geolocate footage of the strike to an industrial area about two miles outside the frontline town of Olenivka. The Ukrainian military said the explosion took place on the territory of the industrial zone, in a newly-constructed building specially equipped to hold prisoners taken out of Azovstal. The Ukrainian prosecutor's office has launched an investigation into the Olenivka strike. In a statement, it said pretrial preliminary data shows ""the occupying state struck the territory of penal colony No. 120 in the temporarily occupied Olenivka village of Volnovakha district of Donetsk region."" Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement ""the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not launch missile and artillery strikes in the area of Olenivka settlement"" and accused Russian forces of carrying out ""a targeted artillery shelling of a correctional institution in the settlement of Olenivka, Donetsk Oblast, where Ukrainian prisoners were also held."" The General Staff statement said the armed forces ""have never conducted and are not conducting shelling of civilian infrastructure, especially places where combat fellows are likely to be kept as POWs."" ""Russian occupiers pursued their criminal goals -- to accuse Ukraine of committing 'war crimes,' as well as to hide the torture of prisoners and executions,"" the General Staff said. ""The alleged shelling of civilian infrastructure and the population by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are outright lies and provocation, the responsibility of which is borne by Russia."" In a statement, the Russian Ministry of Defense said ""the Kyiv regime deliberately carried out a bloody provocation"" and claimed ""40 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed and 75 were wounded. In addition, eight employees of the isolation ward received injuries of varying severity."" ""The pre-trial detention center in the area of ​​the settlement of Yelenovka (Olenivka), which contains Ukrainian military prisoners of war, including militants of the Azov formation, was hit by a missile attack from the American HIMARS multiple launch rocket system."" The Russian Ministry of Defense was reiterating claims made earlier by authorities in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, a separatist-held area of eastern Ukraine. The ministry claimed ""this blatant provocation was committed to intimidate Ukrainian servicemen and prevent them from being taken prisoner."" The senior surgeon on duty at the Central City Clinical Hospital of Donetsk No. 16, Mikhail Yurenko, said the seven survivors of the strike brought to his facility for treatment are in critical condition. ""Seven prisoners of war of the Ukrainian army with lesions of different localization were delivered by ambulance. All patients received combined surgical care,"" Yurenko said in a news conference broadcast over social media. ""The patients are currently in the intensive care unit."" Ukraine blames mercenary group Ukrainian intelligence said the explosion was carried out by the Russia mercenary group Wagner and was not coordinated with the Russian Ministry of Defense. CNN cannot independently verify the accusations. ""According to available information, (the explosions) were carried out by mercenaries from the Wagner (League) PMC under the personal command of the nominal owner of the specified PMC -- Evgeniy Prigozhin,"" the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said in a statement on Friday. ""The organization and execution of the terrorist attack were not coordinated with the leadership of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation."" Ukrainian intelligence says the attack was carried out to hide the embezzlement of funds allocated to maintain the POWs and to stir social tension in Ukraine. ""Considering the great public interest in the fate of the Heroes of Azovstal, according to the authors of the scenario of the terrorist attack, the death of the Defenders should lead to increased social tension in Ukraine,"" the statement read. The head of Ukraine's defense intelligence called on the international community to put pressure on Russia. ""To find out the real circumstances of the terrorist attack and to prevent a repetition of this in the future, I call on all international institutions to express a tough position regarding the events in Olenivka,"" said the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budano. A group working on behalf of Ukrainian soldiers held as prisoners of war posted Friday ""it is with deep sadness that we are forced to confirm the information about the attack on the penal colony in Olenivka, where the 'Azov' regiment soldiers are being held as POW."" The group, known as the Angels of Azov, said on Telegram: ""We are finding out the names of the dead and injured through our own channels. The International Committee of the Red Cross also went to the place."" The International Committee of the Red Cross, whose representatives had previously visited the prisoners, has not commented.",13,4.875269249284501,4.1098067167320895,0.7654625325524114,29
2022-07-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/europe/kherson-ukraine-counteroffensive-cmd-intl/index.html,War for the south: Ukraine sets its sights on regaining cities and towns lost to Russian troops,"A Ukrainian reconnaissance team squats in a modest home in a village near Mykolaiv. Machine guns and army knapsacks line the walls, sleeping bags lie rolled out on the floor, and a pot of soup warms on the stove. Outside, the garden shed is stacked with Javelins and other shoulder-launched anti-tank weapons. The soldiers smoking on the porch hardly notice the boom of incoming artillery shells landing some 10 kilometers away. Today is not their turn to fight on Ukraine's southern front. The owners of the house, who fled to Poland after the war broke out in late February, are happy in the knowledge that their village is now back in Ukrainian hands. Senior Lieutenant Andrii Pidlisnyi was one of the soldiers that drove the Russians out two months ago. ""At first, it was a defensive operation to stop them,"" he says. ""After that we found some good places where we can make offensive operations and take back our territories. And now we're doing that."" Pidlisnyi commands a unit of 100 men tasked with identifying Russian positions, often by drone. They then call in the artillery. On his computer, he shows CNN bodycam videos from his missions earlier in the war. He has had some close calls, but says his morale is high after recent successes. US hardware has helped. One video shows Pidlisnyi sitting in a trench, using his drone to pinpoint Russian tank positions. ""Call in the American gift,"" he says over the radio. Russian troops are now on the defensive in this part of the south -- unlike in the east, where Ukrainian troops are the ones being forced to cede ground. But here too, it is a slog. The aim for soldiers like Pidlisnyi is to take small strategic pockets, areas of high ground with views of occupied Ukrainian towns in the distance, from where further gains can be made. ""I'm not sure we will win it [by] the end of this year,"" he says, referring to retaking Russian-occupied areas in Ukraine's south. ""Maybe not until the end of next year."" The Ukrainian troops claim to have won back some territory. They say they pushed the Russians out of two more villages along the Mykolaiv-Kherson border early this week. But it is a large area of open rolling farmland where any advancing forces would be exposed, and the Russians have had several months to build defensive positions in three layers across the region. And the Ukrainians have limited assault forces -- for much of this conflict they have been playing defense and that has degraded some of their best units. Weapons provided by Western allies are, by and large, not designed for ground offensives, and the Ukrainians are short of air cover for any advancing forces. Ukrainian forces have also been sustaining heavy losses in the south, though the military rarely provides details. There are growing signs that the Russians are reinforcing their military presence in Kherson, determined to hold it as a vital part of the land bridge to Crimea -- and as the peninsula's main source of water. In the past two weeks large convoys have trundled west from Mariupol through Melitopol to Kherson. Many civilians have already fled. Ukrainian officials estimate that nearly half the population of Kherson has left the region for Ukrainian-held territory. They accuse the Russians of preventing more people from leaving cities like Melitopol, in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, so that they can be exploited as ""human shields"" in the event of a Ukrainian offensive. Shifts on the battleground Ukraine's southern front begins near Mykolaiv, a port city to the north of Russian-held Kherson city. It is struck by missiles and rockets almost every day. To the south and east, a meandering front line runs from the Black Sea coast through farmland and up towards Zaporizhzhia region. This area is a long way from the calcified Donetsk front -- fought over since 2014 -- but it is now just one part of a battlefield that stretches for more than 1,000 kilometers. Along the line, artillery pieces face off, in battles one Ukrainian soldier described as ""ping-pong with cannons."" It has been that way for months. Now, the Ukrainians say they have an advantage: Donated weaponry, particularly the HIMARs rocket system supplied by the US, is taking out crucial storage depots and command posts and ammunition dumps deep in Russian-held territory. This month, Ukraine says it destroyed at least two ammunition dumps at Nova Khakova in the Kherson region. Ukraine has also hit three bridges across the Dnipro River, and even a transport of Russian S-300 missiles -- a revamped surface-to-air projectile which has rained horror on Mykolaiv. On Thursday, the UK Ministry of Defense said Russia's 49th Army, stationed on the west bank of the Dnipro River, ""now looks highly vulnerable"" after Ukrainian long-range artillery hit the three bridges. ""One of these, the 1,000-metre long Antonivskyi bridge near Kherson city, was damaged last week,"" and after a further strike this week ""it is highly likely that the crossing is now unusable,"" the Defense Ministry said. It contended that ""Kherson city, the most politically significant population centre occupied by Russia, is now virtually cut off from the other occupied territories."" However the Russians still control large areas to the northeast of the city and may be able to resupply forces on the west bank with pontoon bridges and river ferries across the Dnipro. And more Russian hardware will replace what is lost. CNN has obtained exclusive video footage, taken by partisans, showing S-300 missiles at Dzhankoi railway station in occupied Crimea. Satellite imaging and analysis provided by Maxar indicates as many as 50 S-300 missiles on railcars at the station on Thursday 21 July. Just one S-300 could destroy a building somewhere in Ukraine. Yet despite the enormity of the Russian war machine, Ukraine's military leaders have said this month's strikes on Russian stores and resupply routes could turn the tide on the battlefield. Now, multiple frontline soldiers have backed that up -- telling CNN they believe the Russians have noticeably fewer rounds to fire at them. ""We had about two to three weeks where they didn't have enough ammunition to fight us with artillery, rockets and so on,"" Snr Lt Pidlisnyi says. On another part of the southern front, Ukraine Armed Forces Captain Volodymyr Omelyan tells CNN surgical strikes behind enemy lines are a part of an ongoing modernization Ukraine's strategy. ""We believe that Russians will surrender much faster, especially in Kherson region when we already hit three main bridges, two automobile bridges and one railway one,"" says Omelyan, who was a politician before he joined the army. Omelyan says gains are being made ""day by day"" on the battlefield, but that Ukraine chooses not to advertise them: ""It's a good policy of our commanders to talk about what's happening after it's already happened."" Readying for a long fight In the southern industrial town of Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian forces are put through their paces: Reservists and national guardsmen armed with pellet guns must storm a house. Ukrainian police are on the level above, playing the part of the Russians. After an hour of mock fighting, the trainees have failed to take the top floor -- a sign of how deadly and difficult hand-to-hand urban warfare is. Their commander, Oleksander Piskun, was gravely injured pushing Russian-backed separatists out of cities in the eastern Donbas region in 2014, and has used a wheelchair since. ""Street combat, the battle to storm a settlement is the hardest combat,"" he says. ""It is more difficult because we are not capturing settlements, we are liberating settlements. These are our cities, these are our people."" For now, the fight on the southern front is dominated by artillery, not by street combat. Ukrainians say the future will bring an assault on Kherson, but first, the long-range battle must be waged and won.",14,6.2042747050626605,5.931710627972375,0.2725640770902853,21
2022-07-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/world/russia-quit-iss-scn/index.html,Russia says it will quit the International Space Station after 2024,"Russia says it is planning to pull out of the International Space Station and end its decades-long partnership with NASA at the orbiting outpost, according to the newly appointed head of Russia's space agency. Roscosmos chief Yury Borisov told Russian President Vladimir Putin that ""the decision to leave this station after 2024 has been made."" ""You know that we are working within the framework of international cooperation at the International Space Station. Undoubtedly, we will fulfil all our obligations to our partners, but the decision to leave the station after 2024 has been made,"" Borisov told Putin in the Kremlin-issued readout. NASA said in February it intends to keep operating the International Space Station until the end of 2030, after which the ISS would be deorbited and crashed into a remote part of the Pacific Ocean. Commercially operated space platforms would replace the ISS as a venue for collaboration and scientific research, NASA said. But Robyn Gatens, director of the International Space Station for NASA, said that NASA hadn't received any official word from Russia about the decision to quit the ISS. ""The Russians, just like us are thinking ahead to what's next for them. As we are planning transition after 2030 to commercially operated space stations in low earth orbit, they have a similar plan. And so they're thinking about that transition as well. We haven't received any official word from the partner as to the news today, so we'll be talking more about their plan going forward, "" Gatens said. ""NASA is committed to the safe operation of the International Space Station through 2030, and is coordinating with our partners,"" NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. NASA has not been made aware of decisions from any of the partners, though we are continuing to build future capabilities to assure our major presence in low-Earth orbit."" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said news that Russia will withdraw from the International Space Station is ""an unfortunate development given the critical scientific work performed at the ISS, the valuable professional collaboration our space agencies have had over the years, and especially in light of our renewed agreement on space-flight cooperation."" This is not the first time that Russia has threatened to abandon the ISS amid crippling US and European sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Borisov's predecessor, Dmitry Rogozin, repeatedly threatened to do so before he was ousted earlier this month. Scott Kelly, an American former ISS commander, believes the announcement may be mere posturing. ""I believe Russia will stay as long as they can afford to because without ISS they have no human spaceflight program,"" he said. ""Cooperation with the West also shows some amount of legitimacy to other non-aligned nations and to their own people which Putin needs as the war in Ukraine has damaged his credibility. The design of the ISS makes it difficult for the remaining nations to operate the ISS if either Russia or the US was to withdraw but not impossible. Also, 'after 2024,' is vague and open ended so I think this could be just more bluster,"" he added. But this most recent threat has more teeth, and the apparent approval of Putin himself. According to the transcript of a meeting posted to the Kremlin's website, Putin said ""good"" after Borisov told him that Roscosmos will begin to build its own space station after 2024. Former NASA associate administrator Doug Loverro said that he believes the threat to withdraw from the ISS is real, and possibly a reflection of internal Kremlin politics. ""I think you can read this as a pre-planned follow-on to replacing Rogozin. If he had said this, it would look like just one more bluster statement. But this is the new guy, presumably very close to Putin, saying this one week after taking over. I think it is real."" Loverro said. Russia's withdrawal would be a major blow to the ISS, a model of international cooperation for decades. The news comes less than two weeks after NASA and Roscosmos announced a crew-exchange deal or ""seat swap"" that had been under negotiations for more than four years. Starting in September, two Russian cosmonauts will launch on US spacecrafts from Florida while two American astronauts will ride Russian rockets into space. It's unclear if Russia's decision to pull out of the ISS after 2024 will impact the crew-exchange agreement. The ISS, which is a collaboration among the US, Russia, Japan, Canada and the European Space Agency, is divided into two sections -- the Russian Orbital Segment and the US Orbital Segment. The Biden administration announced in December that it was committed to extending the ISS from 2024 to 2030. But Russia -- NASA's number one partner at the ISS -- never signed onto it. ""The Russian segment can't function without the electricity on the American side, and the American side can't function without the propulsion systems that are on the Russian side,"" former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman told CNN in February. ""So you can't do an amicable divorce. You can't do a conscious uncoupling."" Since then, NASA has been exploring ways of moving the space station without the assistance of the Russian segment. In June, a Cygnus cargo spacecraft demonstrated its ability to raise the station's orbit. But whether the ISS would be able to survive without the Russians is still an open question. And the US is making contingency plans in case Russia follows through with its publicly stated intention of withdrawing after 2024. ""That's the responsible thing to do,"" NSC communications coordinator John Kirby said. He said the US remained committed to working with all International Space Station partners but was taking prudent steps to prepare for a possible Russian withdrawal. Launched in 2000, the ISS has orbited 227 nautical miles above Earth with more than 200 astronauts from 19 different countries enjoying stints aboard -- representing a continuous human presence in space. China, whose astronauts have long been excluded from the ISS, launched the second module of its space station this week. While not as large as the ISS, the Chinese space station is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year.",3,7.607874821809337,6.141705611624838,1.466169210184499,11

2022-07-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/europe/russia-liberation-southern-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Russia claims it liberated Ukraine's south, but hundreds flee each day","Soldiers toting guns and grenades while drunk, looting private property, and squabbling with fellow fighters to the point of armed stand-offs: Civilians who have escaped the Russian-controlled city of Kherson in Ukraine's south say their home has become unrecognizable since Moscow's troops began their uncompromising occupation in early March. After four months living under Russian rule, farmer Andrei Halilyuk traveled on foot, by bus, car and a rubber dinghy over a river to get to the Ukrainian-held city of Kryvyi Rih. It took the grandfather 12 hours on roads sometimes littered with landmines. He calls the invaders ""barbarians."" ""There is no other word for them,"" he says, describing pro-Russian fighters from Donetsk squatting in apartments. ""How is it possible for children to be there if they're walking around drunk with guns and grenades in the village. How can a child see this?"" Halilyuk asks. Ill-discipline among the mishmash of mercenaries, conscripts, separatists, and soldiers that Russia has relied on to attack Ukraine has contributed to the chaos of its occupation. Halilyuk says in his village, fighters for the Russia-friendly Donetsk People's Republic turned on their Russian counterparts as they tried to steal a local man's car. What resulted was a fierce argument at gunpoint, between two groups meant to be on the same side. ""They almost shot each other,"" Haliluk recounts. ""They were fighting among themselves. They cocked their guns at each other."" ""And they came to liberate us. From who? Did we ask for this? Did we ask for you to come here?"" Every day, around 400 people arrive in Kryvyi Rih from Russian-occupied territories and the conflict zone, grateful to reach the relative safety of the industrial city some 40 miles north of the frontline. In total, more than 61,000 have taken refuge there since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. One local official in Kryvyi Rih told CNN that administrators began printing paperwork for displaced people on the day Russia invaded, predicting the mass exodus that would follow. ""I would wake up each morning to explosions and gunfire, then go to sleep at night with explosions and gunfire,"" Halilyuk says. ""Here it's quiet. Yes, there are air raid sirens from time to time, but it's not like you're in bed shaking back and forth."" Kherson resists A Ukrainian fightback to the south has pushed Kryvyi Rih out of the range of Russian artillery, according to the local military administration. But nowhere in this country is safe from Russian missile attacks. Now, Ukraine is hurling missiles of its own at Kherson -- making use of donated military hardware such as the American HIMARS mobile rocket system to strike deep into enemy territory. The Ukrainians say hits on Russian ammunition depots and command posts in Kherson have made it easier for them to take back villages, inching closer to civilians who they say are working to oust the Russians. When Russian troops first took Kherson, locals met armored personnel carriers with protests -- brandishing Ukraine's blue-and-yellow flag. Now, the occupation has cut off the city's communications with the outside world, but the Ukrainian government claims there remains a local resistance movement. Anti-Russian graffiti and effigies of Russian troops remind the occupiers of its existence. ""People have an understanding that the liberation of the territory will happen, that the collaborators and occupants will not stay there forever,"" said Nataliya Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military's southern command. ""People do not want to work with them. They don't want to teach their curriculum, they don't want to treat their soldiers. They do not want to. This is resistance,"" she says. Forced to be Russian Home to around 300,000 people before the war, Kherson is the largest population center Russia has captured in its five-month campaign. There, the newly installed regional administration has repeatedly said it will hold a referendum on becoming a ""full-fledged"" member of the Russian Federation. The White House believes this effort by Russia to formally annex the Kherson region, as well as parts of Zaporizhzhia and the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, could happen before the end of this year. The Russian ruble would be established as the official currency and Ukrainians would be forced to apply for Russian citizenship, the White House said Tuesday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov appeared to confirm such intentions on July 20, when he said Moscow's geographical objectives now stretched beyond Donetsk and Luhansk to ""Kherson Region, Zaporizhzhia Region and a number of other territories."" In Kherson, the ruble is already in circulation and official forms are distributed in Russian -- whether locals can speak the language or not. Local endocrinologist Dr. Maksim Ovchar says he helped his Ukrainian-speaking neighbors by translating those forms, but he refused to work for the imposed administration. ""I lost my job. My house. Some of my friends I lost, they (were) murdered by the Russians,"" he says. The 26-year-old met CNN at a reception center for displaced people in Kryvyi Rih, where he broke down in tears, admitting he was embarrassed to be turning to charity. But Moscow was a master he would not serve. ""They wanted to co-opt me,"" he says, ""make me a member of the occupation administration in public health. I was the last endocrinologist in the city and probably in the region. Because everyone fled."" Dr. Ovchar says he was detained twice for his recalcitrance, with armed Russians ultimately threatening his family before he fled Kherson with his grandmother. Ovchar chose July 7 to travel, when, he says, Russian troops were drunkenly celebrating the anniversary of an older military victory in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine. Blocking escape Many major routes out of Kherson have been closed off by the Russian army. In the frontline town of Zelenodolsk, an hour's drive south from Kryvyi Rih, hundreds of discarded bicycles tell of improvised escapes. Recent drone footage captured by a Ukrainian soldier shows a bedraggled column of women, children and the elderly walking a dusty road to safety. Cars have been shot at on other roads, escapees say. The town was shelled by the Russians on multiple days this week. At the Kryvyi Rih reception center, Dr. Ovchar's face contorts with tears and anger as he admits that his hatred of Russia's war has led him to question his own Hippocratic Oath. Ukrainian doctors treated wounded Russian soldiers when they arrived at his hospital after a fight with the local resistance. Now, he says, he'd kill them if he had the chance. ""Despite the fear and me being a doctor, I can't allow myself to do harm a person, but I'll tell you honestly if there was a Russian I would kill him if I had a gun.""",14,5.754706905974528,3.5859920943736836,2.1687148116008443,15
2022-07-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/europe/russia-ukraine-military-objective-east-donbas-intl/index.html,Lavrov says Russia's objectives in Ukraine now extend beyond eastern Donbas region,"Russia's objectives in Ukraine now extend beyond the eastern Donbas region into the country's south, a senior government minister has said. As the war in Ukraine approaches its fifth month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told state media that the ""geography is different."" ""It is far from being only DPR (Donetsk People's Republic) and LPR (Luhansk People's Republic), it is also Kherson Region, Zaporizhzhia Region and a number of other territories, and this process continues, it continues steadily and persistently,"" Lavrov said during an interview with RIA Novosti, published Wednesday. Lavrov's remarks signal the Kremlin's refocused approach to the war in Ukraine. Just three months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin shifted military efforts onto the country's east after failing to capture Kyiv. When Russian forces followed through with Putin's order and captured the last city in Luhansk region still in Ukrainian hands -- Lysychansk -- earlier this month, their next move was anticipated to be in the neighboring region of Donetsk. If Donetsk were to fall, Moscow would overrun the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which has harbored Russian-backed separatist factions since 2014. However, recently supplied US HIMARS Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) worth $400 million have bolstered the Ukrainian military's ability to strike down Russian targets -- a significant factor that has caused fresh problems for Moscow. Earlier this month, there were huge explosions in several occupied areas in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. The available evidence, from satellite imagery and Western analysts, is that the targeting has been highly effective. Mykhailo Podolyak, advisor to the Ukrainian President's Chief of Staff, repeated calls for more HIMARS weapons on Ukrainian television on Wednesday. Lavrov said that as the West continues to supply Ukraine with more long-range weaponry, including High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), Russia's geographical objectives in Ukraine would move further away from the current line. ""We cannot allow any weapons in the part of Ukraine controlled by Zelensky or whoever will replace him that pose a direct threat to our territory or the territory of the republics that declared independence or those that wish to determine their future independently,"" Lavrov said. ""The President was very clear, as you quoted: denazification and demilitarization in the sense that there should be no threat to our security, no military threat from Ukraine's territory, and this objective remains,"" Lavrov said. Lavrov has also said that it is currently ""pointless"" to hold talks with Ukraine, in an interview with Russian state outlet Russia Today on Wednesday. He accused the West of pushing Ukraine to refrain from negotiations until it can ""start talking from a position of strength."" Lavrov claimed that Russia had been ready to strike a deal with Ukraine, but that nothing came of it. ""We handed them a document which, I emphasize again, was based on their logic,"" Lavrov said in the interview, which was published on the Russian Foreign Ministry website. ""They got this document on April 15, and we've heard nothing from them since."" ""But we've heard other things, from Scholz, from Boris Johnson who obviously isn't saying it now, from Ursula von der Leyen and many others, including chief diplomat Borrell, that Ukraine must win on the battlefield, that Ukraine must not negotiate now because it's in a weak position on the frontline, and that Ukraine must first improve this position and start to dominate over the Russian armed forces, the Donetsk and Luhansk militias, and only then start talking from a position of strength,"" Lavrov said. ""I think this kind of talk is for the birds, as they say,"" he added.",14,1.8459947728765065,6.218586592592569,-4.372591819716062,21
2022-07-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/politics/russia-solarwinds-hackers/index.html,"Russian hackers behind SolarWinds breach continue to scour US and European organizations for intel, researchers say","The Russian hackers behind a sweeping 2020 breach of US government networks have in recent months continued to hack US organizations to collect intelligence while also targeting an unnamed European government that is a NATO member, cybersecurity analysts tell CNN. The new findings show how relentless the hacking group — which US officials have linked with Russia's foreign intelligence service — is in its pursuit of intelligence held by the US and its allies, and how adept the hackers are at targeting widely used cloud-computing technologies. The hacking efforts come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to fray US-Russia relations and drive intelligence collection efforts from both governments. ""In recent months, [the hacking group] has compromised the networks of US-based organizations that have data of interest to the Russian government,"" said Charles Carmakal, senior vice president and chief technology officer at US cybersecurity firm Mandiant, which has responded to the hacks. Carmakal declined to elaborate on the types or number of US organizations that had been breached. In separate activity revealed Tuesday, US cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks said that the Russian hacking group had been using popular services like Dropbox and Google Drive to try to deliver malicious software to the embassies of an unnamed European government in Portugal and Brazil in May and June. Though it's unclear how successful those hacking attempts were, they could offer the hackers a foothold into computer networks to collect intelligence, Jen Miller-Osborn, deputy director of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42, told CNN. The two hacking campaigns offer the latest example of how the elite Russian hacking group tried to evade US government and private investigators pursuing it. The Russian hacking group is best known for using tampered software made by federal contractor SolarWinds to breach at least nine US agencies in activity that came to light in December 2020. The attackers were undetected for months in the unclassified email networks of the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and others. The group continued to target US and European government networks, and software providers serving them, throughout 2021, according to researchers. Google and Dropbox told CNN that they took steps to thwart the latest hacking activity. ""We were aware of the activity identified in this report, and had already proactively taken steps to protect any potential targets,"" said Shane Huntley, senior director of Google's Threat Analysis Group. A Dropbox spokesperson told CNN that the company ""disabled user accounts"" involved in the alleged Russian hacking campaign ""immediately"" after they were reported. Russian tracking of Ukrainian hackers Another sign of Russia's voracious appetite for intelligence came Tuesday when researchers from Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) detailed a possible effort, linked with Russia' FSB intelligence service, to track Ukrainian hackers who have targeted Russian organizations. The hacking group set up a web application designed to mimic a tool used by the Ukraine IT Army — a band of hackers encouraged by the Ukrainian government that has targeted Russian corporate and government websites, according to Google. From there, the hackers may have been able to track who downloaded the app and potentially collect information on Ukrainian hackers who have been a thorn in the side of the Russian government. Someone even sent a link to download the bugged app in the Ukrainian IT Army's Telegram channel, according to Billy Leonard, a security engineer at Google TAG. The group responsible, Leonard said, is known as Turla. It is considered one of the Russian government's top-tier espionage teams alongside the hacking group responsible for the SolarWinds intrusions and other groups, and has been linked to skilled break-ins of Western government networks for years. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Turla has targeted government organizations in Latvia, Lithuania and other European countries, Leonard said. But this was the first time the hackers were spotted in Ukraine in four or five months, Leonard told CNN. Adrian Nish, a cybersecurity executive at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence who also observed the Turla activity, said that it made sense for Russian hacking teams to search for new intelligence in Ukraine as the war drags on. ""Given Russia's faltering progress in achieving their goals in Ukraine it is to be expected that efforts of state intelligence apparatus are focused on gathering information on and disrupting opposition forces in any way that they can,"" Nish told CNN.",3,8.76601886213768,7.544623601600648,1.2213952605370313,23

The two high-ranking officials -- Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova and State Security Service (SBU) head Ivan Bakanov, a long-time associate of the President -- are now subject to an investigation and have been temporarily replaced. ""For a long enough time, we have been waiting for more concrete and sufficiently radical results from the leaders of these two departments, to clean these two departments of collaborators and state traitors,"" the deputy head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andrii Smyrnov, told Ukrainian television on Monday. ""However, in the sixth month of the war, we continue to find ... packs of these people, in each of these departments,"" Smyrnov said. In his nightly video address on Sunday, Zelensky appeared to suggest that the pair had been fired. ""Today I made a decision to remove the Prosecutor General from office and to dismiss the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine,"" Zelensky said, adding that many officials within both departments were suspected of treason. But Smyrnov said Monday that the pair have been suspended to ensure they did not interfere with the investigations. Zelensky will decide whether or not to submit a motion to dismiss them to Ukraine's parliament, depending on the results of the probe. ""As of today, 651 criminal proceedings have been registered regarding treason and collaboration activities of employees of prosecutor's offices, pretrial investigation bodies, and other law enforcement agencies,"" Zelensky told Ukrainians on Sunday evening. ""In particular, more than 60 employees of the prosecutor's office and the Security Service of Ukraine remained in the occupied territory and are working against our state. ""Such an array of crimes against the foundations of the national security of the state and the connections detected between the employees of the security forces of Ukraine and the special services of Russia pose very serious questions to the relevant leadership. Each of these questions will receive a proper answer,"" he said. Zelensky named two temporary replacements for the suspended pair on Monday: Vasyl Maliuk will lead the SBU and Ukraine's deputy prosecutor general, Oleksii Symonenko, will head the Prosecutor's Office. The former head of the Main Directorate of the Security Service in Crimea has also been detained on suspicion of treason, according to Zelensky's Sunday address. ""Everyone who together with him was part of a criminal group that worked in the interests of the Russian Federation will also be held accountable. It is about the transfer of secret information to the enemy and other facts of cooperation with the Russian special services,"" he said. Senior officials in the SBU in southern Ukraine have been blamed for the ease with which Russian forces were able to capture large areas of the south within a week of the invasion. Zelensky also said Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal would be tasked with intensifying the search for a new head of the National Anticorruption Bureau.",13,6.253998186650118,5.1904217963124735,1.0635763903376443,7
2022-07-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/17/europe/russia-ukraine-donetsk-battle-for-control-intl/index.html,Bloody battle for control rages in eastern Ukraine as Russia struggles to gain ground in Donetsk,"The Ukrainian military rebuffed Russian advances in Donetsk over the weekend, as the bloody battle for control in the eastern Donbas region grinds on. At least eight settlements in the eastern part of Donetsk came under fire Saturday through Sunday. Most of the settlements straddle a pocket of territory in the highway that leads west from Luhansk region towards the industrial cities of Donetsk, according to the Ukrainian military. ""Ukrainian soldiers competently repelled another combat reconnaissance attempt near Berestove and Bilohorivka,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said, adding that Russian forces were ""firmly repulsed, suffered losses and withdrew."" While Russian forces fire at Ukrainian positions in Donetsk in preparation for the next stage of full-scale fighting in the war, the country's defense ministry in Moscow on Saturday ordered commanders to take action to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian-held territory. ""(Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu) gave the necessary instructions to further increase the actions of groups in all operational areas in order to exclude the possibility of the Kyiv regime to launch massive rocket and artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure and residents of settlements in Donbas and other regions,"" the ministry said in a statement. Shoigu visited Russian forces involved in what the ministry has long described as the ""special military operation in Ukraine,"" the statement added. The order comes in response to a sharp rise in Ukrainian attacks far behind the front lines using recently acquired western howitzers and artillery. Ukrainian army resists Russian advances After Russian forces captured the last city in Luhansk region still in Ukrainian hands -- Lysychansk -- they have stepped up the bombardment of towns and cities in the neighboring Donetsk region. The Russian military has kept up a persistent barrage of artillery and missile strikes across the region for several weeks. The Kremlin says the goal of what it calls the ""special military operation"" is to take control of both Luhansk and Donetsk. About 45% of Donetsk -- a region of heavy industry interspersed with farmland -- is still held by the Ukrainians. But they are under pressure from three directions -- east, north and south. Russian forces are also firing at Ukrainian positions south of the town of Bakhmut, according to the General Staff, including missile and air strikes, as well as artillery. Three missiles hit the Toretsk community but there was no information about casualties, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of Donetsk region military administration. In the city of Kostiantynivka, the Russians had shelled the medical college, Kyrylenko added. He also urged civilians in the area to evacuate. For their part, the Russian armed forces have claimed ""high-precision attacks"" that ""resulted in the elimination of 115th Mechanised Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) that had operated towards Siversk."" The area around Siversk has been heavily contested in the last two weeks, but Ukrainian forces appear to be holding out. Further north the city of Kharkiv has again been hit by missiles, Ukrainian officials say. Two missiles hit a five-storey industrial building and caught fire, Oleh Syniehubov, Head of Kharkiv region military administration said. 'Russia is struggling' As the war in Ukraine approaches five months and both armies suffer heavy losses, western officials say Ukraine ""absolutely"" believes it will regain territory from Russia and win the war. ""They are absolutely clear that they plan to restore the whole of their territory in terms of Ukraine, and they see a Russia that is struggling, a Russia that we assess has lost more than 30% of its land combat effectiveness,"" UK Chief of the Defense Staff Admiral Tony Radakin told the BBC Sunday. ""What that actually means is 50,000 Russian soldiers that have either died or been injured in this conflict, nearly 1,700 Russian tanks destroyed, nearly 4,000 armored fighting vehicles that belong to Russia (were) destroyed. ""And what you're seeing is a Russia, if we focus on the Donbas, that is less than 10% of the territory of Ukraine and we are approaching 150 days, and Russia is struggling to take that territory, and it is struggling because of the courage and determination of the Ukrainian armed forces. ""Russia started this invasion with the ambition to take the whole of Ukraine, Russia had the ambition to take the cities in the first 30 days, Russia had the ambition to create fractures and to apply pressure to NATO, this is Russia as a challenge to the world order, Russia is failing in all of those ambitions, Russia is a more diminished nation than it was at the beginning of February,"" Radakin added. The UK has been one of the strongest backers of President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian war effort. But the Ukrainians are stretched along a vast front line from the Black Sea to the northeastern border with Russia -- well over 1,000 kilometers in length. Despite a steady flow of western arms, Ukraine remains heavily outgunned by vast amounts of Russian artillery, missile batteries and mortars. Very little ground has been won or lost this month -- by either side -- and western analysts see the conflict devolving into a tough war of attrition.",14,5.638912779699776,1.5163762547216522,4.122536524978124,21
2022-07-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/europe/ukraine-western-weapons-russia-front-lines-intl-cmd/index.html,Ukraine's new US rockets are causing fresh problems for Russia,"There's a new and potentially very significant factor in the Ukrainian conflict: the Ukrainians' ability to use recently supplied Western systems to hit Russian command posts, logistical hubs and ammunition dumps a long way beyond the front lines. In the past week, there have been enormous explosions in several occupied areas in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. The available evidence, from satellite imagery and Western analysts, is that the targeting has been highly effective. For months the Ukrainian military pleaded for long-range precision artillery and rocket systems from Western partners. Now they have them and are deploying them to considerable effect in both the south and east of the country. The Ukrainian military is not giving away many specifics but Vadim Denysenko, a senior official at the Interior Ministry, said Wednesday that in the past two weeks, ""above all things thanks to the weapons that Ukraine received, we were able to destroy approximately two dozen warehouses with weapons and stocks of fuel and lubricants. This will certainly affect the intensity of fire"" the Russians can muster, he said. Best-in-class is the US-supplied HIMARS multiple launch rocket system, but the Ukrainians have also received M777 howitzers from both the US and Canada, and Caesar long-range howitzers from France. In addition, the UK has committed to providing M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), which are more powerful than HIMARS, but it's unclear when Ukraine will complete training on the system and deploy it. The HIMARS' versatility is in its name: the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. Its mobility makes it harder to target and it can be crewed by just eight soldiers. The rockets supplied to Ukraine have a range of 70 to 80 kilometers (about 50 miles). And their GPS guidance systems make them extremely accurate. As Mick Ryan, a military analyst and former Australian major-general, puts it: ""It is used to destroy critical communications nodes, command posts, airfields, and important logistics facilities."" Senior Russian officers are therefore especially vulnerable. HIMARS' accuracy also means the Ukrainians can worry less about civilian casualties. The guided rockets are accurate to within two to three meters, two defense officials told CNN, allowing the Ukrainians to use far fewer rounds to hit targets precisely at distance. The HIMARS appears to have been used in a massive strike against a warehouse in the town of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region on Monday night. The strike set off secondary explosions and caused widespread damage, according to satellite imagery reviewed by CNN. The imagery showed how precise the attack had been, leaving just one small crater. Local pro-Russian officials said parts of one HIMARS rockets were recovered; the serial numbers matched the weapon. There were also large explosions in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, setting off multiple detonations. The same happened at Shakhtarsk in Donetsk and in the Kherson region at the weekend, as well as near Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia last week. Altogether, it appears that about a dozen targets deep behind Russian lines have been hit in July, most of them at least 40 kilometers behind the front -- a distance at which accuracy with old Tochka-U missiles would be difficult. The Ukrainians have also been firing HIMARS at night, making it more difficult for the Russians to spot and strike the launchers. Russian forces have struggled to fight at night since the beginning of the conflict, and the Ukrainians are still using this to their advantage. Changing the battlefield Targeting may also have been made easier by the way the Russian military stores and moves its weapons. Phillips O'Brien, professor strategic studies at St Andrews University, says the Nova Kakhovka strike is revealing ""about the state of the logistics war and the real problems the Russians face."" The target was adjacent to a rail hub, vital to the Russian logistics effort to sustain their offensive, and so was an obvious target. ""The Russians left a ludicrously easy to locate, major supply depot exactly where someone would expect to find it. Either the Russians are unable to react because of command failure or they can't actually move the depots because they lack the road movement,"" O'Brien tweeted. One Ukrainian official hinted that targeting the warehouse had been easy. Serhiy Khlan, a member of Kherson regional council, said on Facebook: ""In Nova Kakhovka minus one Russian ammo depot. They brought, brought, stockpiled, stockpiled and now have fireworks at night."" Ben Hodges, the former commander of the US Army in Europe, tweeted after the Kherson attack at the weekend: ""Least favorite job in the Russian Army? Ammunition handler."" In a briefing last week, a senior US Defense Department official said that ""the focus on higher capability, precision, further-range weapons"" for Ukraine was front and center. On Friday, the Pentagon announced a shipment to Ukraine of 1,000 rounds of 155mm artillery shells -- but a newer munition with greater accuracy, according to the official. The Ukrainians have been expending 155mm munitions at a rate of 3,000 a day. Like HIMARS, the more accurate rounds should mean fewer are needed. The official contended that HIMARS was changing the battlefield. ""What we've seen is the ability of the Ukrainians to use these HIMAR systems to significantly disrupt the ability of the Russians to move forward."" ""If the Russians think they can outlast the Ukrainians, they need to rethink that,"" the official added. A Russian military reporter, Yuri Kotenok, said this week that the HIMARS represents ""a serious threat. The liberated areas of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, the DPR and the LPR, as well as the territory of Russia, fall under the possible fire of HIMARS."" Kotenok, who has nearly 300,000 followers on Telegram, said Russian air defenses need to be improved -- as does the targeting of HIMARS, whether in transit or deployed. He said that ""If this continues, it is necessary to hit the decision-making centers. Our limitations in retaliatory strikes against the enemy are to some extent incomprehensible to me."" Another Russian reporter, Roman Sapenkov, said he witnessed the strike at the weekend on the Russian base at Kherson's airport. ""I was struck by the fact that the whole packet, five or six rockets, landed practically on a penny. Usually MLRS lands in a wide area, and at maximum range they scatter like a fan,"" he wrote, referring to multiple launch rocket systems that are less advanced than HIMARS or the M777. ""It is clear this is just the beginning ... They will cover all the command posts and military facilities; the data for this has been collected for the last 4 months."" The importance of pallets One problem for the Russians may be the way they transport munitions, which is where the humble pallet comes into play. Few Russian military trucks include a crane to lift heavy munitions, which are rarely carried on pallets but loaded and unloaded by hand. Plenty of ageing Soviet ZIL trucks have been seen in Ukraine. Moving weapons and ammunition this way is cumbersome, time-consuming and potentially gives enemy surveillance a greater opportunity to detect such shipments. By contrast, the UK and US militaries palletize much of their ammunition or carry it in containers. The Russian way of war -- as witnessed over the last three months in eastern Ukraine -- relies on huge artillery barrages to pulverize targets before moving forward. Russian military doctrine has always emphasized a massive use of artillery, MLRS and mortars. That demands constant resupply: Some analysts calculate that Russia is using at least 7,000 shells and rockets a day in Donbas, and often many more. Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said Wednesday: ""The Russian army does not stop shelling. However, most likely, it saves the existing stocks of shells, because their supply has been interrupted by the work of our new long-range weapons."" Ukrainian officials claim that the Russians are being thrown off-balance by their growing capability for long-range precision attacks. In and around Melitopol, for example, the Russians have imposed restrictions on civilian movements in recent days. The area has seen at least two major strikes this month against Russian bases. But for the Ukrainians to sustain this rate of strikes requires an unimpeded conduit of munitions from the West. The Ukrainian military is transitioning from an organization largely reliant on Soviet-era artillery and rocket systems -- with inadequate ammunition -- to using precision Western weapons with enough ammunition in a matter of months. Also unknown is whether any of the handful of HIMARS so far shipped have been taken out by Russian fire. The Ukrainian military and defense ministries avoid providing details about their deployment. Ryan cautions that while the HIMARS ""has provided the Ukrainian Armed Forces with a new 'Long Hand' to attack the Russian invaders, there is no such thing as a silver bullet solution in war."" But US officials are confident that the accuracy of the weapon -- as well as other accurate long-range systems -- will progressively change the battlefield.",14,0.9068142011640581,5.755121702678612,-4.8483075015145545,12
2022-07-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/politics/osce-report-russia-war-crimes/index.html,Experts document alleged crimes against humanity committed by Russian forces in Ukraine,"A new report from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe found that patterns of violent acts by Russian forces in Ukraine meet the qualification of crimes against humanity, detailing horrific actions by Russian forces including the discovery of torture chambers at a summer camp in Bucha. The new report released Thursday was the latest instance of groups documenting potential war crimes committed by Russian forces. The OSCE experts who put together the report traveled to Kyiv and met with Ukrainian authorities there as well as Bucha and Irpin, where they found ""grave breaches"" of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention. The report ""found credible evidence"" that suggested ""some patterns of violent acts which had been repeatedly documented during the conflict,"" including ""killing, rape abductions or massive deportations of civilians, qualified as a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population."" The OSCE mission that compiled the report wrote that 1.3 million Ukrainian citizens have been deported against their will to Russia and said there was evidence that tens of thousands of civilians had been detained at so-called filtration centers before being transported to Russian-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine. US Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter said in a statement that the report ""gives us an opportunity to pull back and document the unconscionable atrocity crimes, human rights violations, and abuses members of Russia's forces have committed."" This week's report is the second that OSCE has released documenting atrocities committed against the Ukrainian population. In April, the group released its first report with similar findings of ""credible evidence"" suggesting violations of ""even the most fundamental human rights."" Together, both reports ""comprise the most comprehensive accounting of evidence to date of Russia's human rights abuses, international humanitarian law violations,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement after the second report's release Thursday. ""The United States and our partners will seek to hold accountable those responsible for all human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including war crimes, they commit in Ukraine,"" Price added. The report noted that it had identified ""numerous violations"" of international humanitarian law that constituted war crimes, ""if the responsible individuals can be found."" ""These violations included mistreatment of prisoners of war, deliberate killing of civilians, deliberate attacks against civilians and against civilian objects, including schools, hospitals or cultural property, or the failure to respect the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions,"" the report said. The second report covered the period between April 1 to June 25. The OSCE experts traveled to Ukraine to collect evidence, including visiting the towns of Bucha and Irpin, which the report said were ""two emblematic examples of the breaches of International Humanitarian Law under the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, which constitute war crimes."" The experts noted that photographic and video evidence showed Russian forces caried out ""targeted, organized killings of civilians in Bucha"" who were found shot dead with their hands tied behind their backs. 'Series of torture chambers' The report documented a ""series of torture chambers separated by concrete walls"" discovered at a summer camp in Bucha, including a room that the report said appeared to be used for executions with bullet holes in the walls. In another room where experts said there was evidence of torture and waterboarding, five dead men were found. ""They were covered with burns, bruises, and lacerations,"" the report said. In another village in Bucha, the bodies of 18 men, women, and children were discovered in a basement. The report said that ""some had their ears cut off, while others had their teeth pulled out."" The OSCE mission wrote that reports of women and girls being raped and sexually abused by Russian forces ""have become abundant,"" especially in newly occupied territories. The report noted several particularly atrocious cases, including a report from the Commissioner for Human Rights Denisova, who said that 25 girls aged 14-24 were kept in a basement in Bucha and gang-raped. Nine became pregnant, the report said. The report also documented instances of Ukrainian civilians being used as ""human shields,"" being forced to fight alongside Russians against their own country in the ongoing war and being displaced to Russia without their consent.

2022-07-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/europe/ukraine-russia-next-stages-donetsk-intl/index.html,Two exhausted armies are battling for eastern Ukraine. Can either of them strike a decisive blow?,"When Vladimir Putin refocused his war in Ukraine on the country's east three months ago, he did so bruised by the failures of his initial lunge towards Kyiv and desperate for a face-saving success. After a slow and bloody march through Luhansk was finalized with the capture of the city of Lysychansk, the Russian President might consider himself halfway there. But the war has arrived at another crossroads and fighters on both sides are steeling themselves for a third act of fighting that could tip the balance of the conflict. ""It's a very attritional struggle,"" said Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow for Airpower and Technology at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), describing the tone of the war after three months of fighting in Donbas. ""It's a struggle between two armies, both of whom have taken huge losses and are very close to exhaustion."" Putin's next move is anticipated to be a drive into Donetsk, which if captured would fulfill the Kremlin's primary objective: overrunning the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which has housed Russian-backed separatist factions since 2014. But when and how that takes place is unclear. While Russia has continued intense airstrikes on various fronts in Ukraine, the US-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Sunday that Russian ground troops were in the middle of an operational pause to ""rest, refit, and reconstitute."" That could give Ukraine's army time to prepare to defend the parts of Donetsk it still holds; chiefly the industrial belt running south from the city of Sloviansk. And the threat of Ukrainian counter-offensives elsewhere in the country, including the key southern city of Kherson, remains. The next phase of full-scale fighting, when it does break out, may not be the last. But it may determine the future of Ukraine's heartland region -- and analysts say it will go some considerable way to determining the war's results. Lessons from Luhansk The past three months of grueling, grinding warfare in Donbas have looked almost nothing like the opening act of Russia's invasion, which saw scattergun incursions from north, east and west and ended in a decisive failure to overrun Kyiv and other key Ukrainian cities. Instead, the Kremlin's refocused effort has tightened the boundaries of the war, zeroing in on a key path across Luhansk and towards Donetsk to which the bulk of Russia's resources were directed. ""The second phase of this war has seen Russia returning to basics,"" Max Bergmann, the director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN. That has resulted in sluggish but steady progress for Russia, which has won several weekslong battles for strategic cities and exposed limitations in Ukraine's arsenal. ""They've used their mass, their artillery assets, and (have been) pummeling Ukrainian forces while operating in a slow grind,"" Bergmann said. Its advantages in weaponry and firepower have started to show. ""All of (Russia's) electronic warfare, air defense and armored formations can be concentrated on very small areas,"" allowing them to ""create local superiority"" over Ukraine's more stretched, defensive positions, said Bronk. ""Round one was a knockout for Ukraine. In round two, the Russians won on points,"" said Bergmann in his assessment of the war's opening phases. But three months of war has taken its toll on both armies, and the capture of Luhansk brings two exhausted militaries to an inflection point. ""Russian forces will likely continue to confine themselves to small-scale offensive actions as they rebuild forces and set conditions for a more significant offensive in the coming weeks or months,"" the ISW said on Thursday. Fighting has continued near the Donetsk-Luhansk border; the Ukrainian military on Friday listed more than 40 towns and villages in Donbas that have come under attack in the last 24 hours, acknowledging ""partial success"" of a Russian attempt to advance on one front near the city of Bakhmut. But the ISW nonetheless has assessed that an operational pause for Russian ground troops is underway, and the pace of Russian territorial gains dropped last week following their takeover of Luhansk. The benefits of some form of lull for both armies are obvious; Russia's depleted forces need recuperation, while Ukraine's military is in a race to receive, deliver and become familiar with Western equipment. ""Russian troops that fought through Severodonetsk and Lysychansk very likely do need a significant period in which to rest and refit before resuming large-scale offensive operations,"" according to the ISW. ""It seems like we're in a stasis, but it's a very unstable balance and we don't know which way it will break,"" Bergmann said. ""Behind the scenes, there will be a frantic effort on both sides to prepare for future offensives."" Whichever side uses this period more effectively could be able to seize the upper hand when all-out fighting resumes. The war's next flashpoints Russia's anticipated next move will be to continue the path it has forged through Luhansk, moving into Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk and attempting to wear down and encircle Ukrainian troops in that oblast too. Doing so would deliver the symbolically significant Donbas region to Moscow -- and complete the main objective that Putin laid out as he launched his invasion in February, when he falsely claimed that those regions are spiritually and culturally Russian, and that Russian speakers were being persecuted there. But if the timeline and tactics used in Luhansk are repeated in its neighbor region, it will take another bitter and bloody fight. ""There's two names that are sadly going to become very familiar"" as the key battles in the next phase of fighting -- the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, in northern Donetsk. ""I suspect they will be the next Severodonestk and Mariupol,"" said Samir Puri, a senior fellow in urban security and hybrid warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), who worked as a ceasefire observer in Donbas between 2014 and 2015. Those cities have been primed to become flashpoints in the war for months; they now sit surrounded to the east and south by Russian-controlled territory and their capture would be a major breakthrough for the Kremlin. ""Probably, they will [attack Sloviansk]. Probably, that is why the incoming hits have become more frequent,"" the head of the city's military-civilian administration, Vadym Liakh, said on Wednesday, adding that currently Ukrainian forces were holding Moscow's armies on the Siverskyi Donets river. ""I think that as soon as the enemy is able to carry out assault operations, it will begin the destruction of the infrastructure and the city itself,"" Liakh said. The tenor of fighting in the region is likely to look similar to Russia's drives into cities like Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, whose fall marked the end of Ukraine's defense of Luhansk. Ukraine's defense is again expected to be stubborn. ""They want to make this as hard and long a slog as possible for the Russians,"" said Bergmann. ""That's how they have pursued this war; they have fought the Russians for every inch of territory, and when it becomes a tactical mistake to keep fighting they withdraw, but not precipitously."" ""You fall back, but as you fall back, you fight."" But as with Luhansk, Russia will hope to seize the front foot and grind down the Ukrainian resistance, which will struggle to launch effective offenses. ""(Ukraine) will have the ability to slowly bleed the Russians through Donetsk,"" but may lack the ""availability of infantry and armored formations that are equipped and fresh enough to punch forward,"" said Puri. ""They're having to experience a military metamorphosis to get to that offensive capability."" There will, meanwhile, be flare-ups in other regions that could disrupt Russia's main objectives in Donbas. In recent weeks Ukraine has regained Snake Island and had some success with counter-offensives near Kherson, southern Ukraine, which are now ramping up and forcing Russia onto the defensive. On Monday night, the Ukrainian military struck what it said was a Russian ammunition depot in the town of Nova Kakhovka in Kherson region, in what appeared to be one of the largest attacks inside Russian-occupied territory since the war began. A Russian official said the Ukrainian strike was carried out with a long-range HIMARS artillery system supplied by the United States, but claimed the attack hit a fertilizer warehouse and homes. Ukraine has begun targeting Russian command posts and ammunition dumps far behind the front lines in both Kherson and Donbas, using newly supplied Western weaponry that has a much greater range than its previous artillery systems. Serhii Khlan, an advisor to the head of Kherson civil military administration, said Tuesday: ""We have already launched attacks along almost the entire front line"" -- and the Russians were now reinforcing their checkpoints ""because the partisan movement is intensifying in the Kherson region. He added that Russia is ""preparing for street battles"" in the city. Meanwhile, Ukrainian news outlet Ria-Melitopol reported last week that large amounts of Russian military equipment has been seen moving through Melitopol, including tank and armored vehicle convoys, towards Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Last week, Russian-appointed authorities in the Kherson region arrested the elected Ukrainian mayor of the city, Ihor Kolykhaiev, hours before announcing plans for a referendum to join Russia. ""The focus for the Russians very much is still in that small area (in the Donbas), whereas for the Ukrainians it seems to be pushing forwards and creating a breakthrough in Kherson,"" Bronk said. Doing so ""would create really quite a serious problem for Russia."" Kherson was seized and occupied by Russia in the early days of the invasion. If the Ukrainians were able to seize it back, it would disrupt Russian supply lines, cut its land bridge to Crimea and represent a significant boost to morale. Grasping for firepower Russia's war in Ukraine is pushing towards the six-month mark, and the course of its next phase will depend heavily on the firepower and weaponry each side can still draw on. The head of the Luhansk region military administration, Serhiy Hayday, said this week that Ukraine is inflicting significant losses on Russia's armies in the Donbas, and claimed that with the help of additional Western long-range weaponry, ""the advantage of the enemy in personnel will be leveled."" The Russian Ministry of Defense does not regularly report the number of dead and injured among its forces and CNN could not independently verify Hayday's claims about Russian casualties. However, independent analysts and observers, including some Russian military bloggers, have criticized the effort made by Moscow to capture the city of Lysychansk, saying it wa",14,4.6940922388820745,6.178599760316271,-1.484507521434196,21

Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and ESA were collaborating on a mission involving the European ExoMars Rover, designed to look for signs of life on Mars. The rover's September 2022 launch was initially suspended in March, just weeks after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now, the ESA Council has officially cut ties with Roscosmos on this joint project as a result of the war in Ukraine and ongoing sanctions, ESA's Director General Josef Aschbacher wrote Tuesday on Twitter. There will be more details shared about the future of the mission on July 20, he said. The ESA has been considering working more closely with NASA moving forward since it became clear the agency needed ""to sever"" its ties with Russia, Aschbacher said. ""Geopolitically, it is clear that we need to sever our ties with Russia, and this decision has been made by the member states,"" Aschbacher previously told CNN. ""So yes, it's really unfortunate for all the science and technology and the engineers who have been working on this for four decades. But there is no other choice to make."" The rover was originally scheduled to launch in July 2020, but the pandemic pushed back the launch window. ExoMars is also known as Rosalind Franklin, a revered scientist who aided in the decoding of DNA's molecular structure, according to the ESA. Part of the rover's mission includes drilling holes up to 6.6 feet (2 meters) to collect samples for onboard analysis. ExoMars is expected to travel multiple kilometers during its mission and is capable of moving between 164 and 328 feet (50 and 100 meters) per Martian day, which is just under an hour longer than Earth's 24 hours, according to NASA.",3,8.715346824811155,8.520602519653421,0.19474430515773378,11

The residential building in the town of Chasiv Yar was hit on Saturday evening as Russia once again ramped up its assault on cities and towns in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to take control over the entire Donbas area. Twenty-four bodies have been pulled from the wreckage and a further five were visible but not retrievable, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said Monday. Emergency workers had rescued six people and established contact with two others who were still buried under the wreckage, the emergency service said. ""As of now around 72% of the rubble has been cleared,"" Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, told Ukrainian media Monday. Over the weekend, Kyrylenko said the area was struck by two or three Russian rockets and that the incident was ""yet another confirmation of the crimes of the Russian Federation, confirmation that they are shelling residential areas."" Chasiv Yar and other towns in Donetsk have been under heavy fire in recent days as Russian forces try to grind down Ukrainian resistance in the area and move further west towards Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Saturday that its troops destroyed a hangar with US-supplied M777 howitzers, long-range weapons, and dozens of Ukrainian ""militants"" near Chasiv Yar. CNN cannot independently verify the Russian claims. Ukrainian officials said the strike hit a railway station in Chasiv Yar and that several people were injured in the attack. Meanwhile, both sides in the conflict have reported fighting north of Sloviansk in the Donetsk region. Ukraine's General Staff said there had been heavy Russian fire against several settlements, including an air strike near the village of Bohorodychne, which lies on the southern side of the Siverskiy Donets river, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Sloviansk. Russian state news agency TASS quoted a source close to the Luhansk People's Militia as saying the key village of Bohorodychne had been taken, and said that ""the organization of a powerful bridgehead for the offensive on Slavyansk [Sloviansk in Ukrainian] continues."" The Ukrainian military said that its soldiers ""successfully repelled the enemy assault in the direction of Krasnopillia,"" which is five kilometers from Bohorodychne. It also said there were ""signs of enemy units preparing to intensify combat operations in the Kramatorsk and Bakhmut directions,"" two other important urban areas. ""Assault and army aviation became more active."" Donetsk and Luhansk are the two regions that together form Donbas, the eastern part of Ukraine where the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists started in 2014. The area has become the key centerpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin's military ambition in Ukraine after his troops failed to take over Kyiv earlier this year. Russian troops have already taken over almost all of the Luhansk region, the head of Luhansk's region military administration Serhiy Hayday said in a telegram post on Saturday, adding that some 300,000 people from the area have been forced to flee their homes. Lysychansk, the last city that was still under Ukrainian control in Luhansk, fell to Russia last week. Russian troops have since focused on the Donetsk region, shelling wide areas along the front line and pushing from the Luhansk region into the Donetsk region, according to Hayday. The regional military administration in Donetsk said Monday that ""the shelling does not stop,"" naming seven towns that had been hit. It said that dozens of buildings had been damaged. Ukrainian forces have been defending this area against Russian attacks for more than a month. To the west of Donetsk city, the Ukrainians said ""another offensive attempt by the occupiers in the direction of Mariinka has completely failed."" Away from Donetsk, Russian attacks on the northeastern city of Kharkiv and its surrounding area has intensified, with shelling and tank fire hitting half-a-dozen settlements around the city on Monday, said Ukrainian military. At least six people were killed and 31 injured in Russian bombardment of three Kharkiv districts, according to Ukrainian officials. Serhii Bolvinov, head of the investigation department of Kharkiv's National Police, said a shopping center was damaged, as well as houses and vehicles. Among the dead was a father and his 17-year-old son. They were on their way to pick up a certificate for the teenager's university entrance before the car took a direct hit, he said. 'Million strong' force Ukraine's Armed Forces are massing a ""million strong"" fighting force to retake lands in southern Ukraine that have been under Russian occupation, Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine's defense minister, told the British newspaper The Times. Reznikov said that the offensive would be bolstered by the use of Western weapons. The minister added that President Volodymr Zelensky gave the orders to retake the coastal areas in the south which are crucial to Ukraine's economy. Reznikov said that Ukraine had a force of 1 million made up of 700,000 servicemen, and the other 300,000 coming from the national guard, police and border force. The southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions have also become hotspots in the conflict, with Ukrainian forces stepping up their firing against Russian storage and supply lines in occupied territory in the south and Russia using artillery fire to try to prevent Ukrainian advances. Ukraine's campaign in Kherson continued over the weekend, with several videos showing Ukrainian units among the wreckage of Russian armor. One Ukrainian unit, the 60th Infantry Brigade, published video on Monday from the northern Kherson settlement of Ivanivka, with one of the soldiers saying: ""We received an order to take this position, so we did and still holding it."" At least two Russian garrisons and ammunition depots were hit by Ukrainian forces well behind the front lines in Kherson. ""The destruction of enemy command posts of various levels and ammunition depots is taking place,"" the military's General Staff said Monday. The military's Operational Command in the south gave further details about one of the strikes, saying that a pair of attack aircraft had hit a command post in Kherson city. It claimed 38 Russian personnel had been killed and 10 units of equipment, including howitzers and a portable anti-aircraft missile complex, had been destroyed, as well as two ammunition warehouses.

Access to Congress.gov was intermittently disrupted from around 9 p.m. ET Thursday until the website was restored to normal operation ""just after"" 11 p.m. ET, April Slayton, director of communications for the Library of Congress, which runs the website, told CNN. ""The Library of Congress used existing measures to address the attack quickly, resulting in minimal down time,"" Slayton said in an email. ""The Library's network was not compromised and no data was lost as a result of the attack."" A Russian-speaking hacking group known as Killnet claimed responsibility for the hack on their Telegram channel. The post included a screenshot of an error message on Congress.gov overlaid with an image of President Joe Biden with a puzzled look on his face. The hackers used a popular tactic known as a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), according to Slayton, which floods computer servers with phony web traffic in an attempt to knock websites offline. Congress.gov displays information on bills, hearings and other deliberations of Congress. While DDoS attacks can have material consequences, such as when customers can't access banking websites, they are sometimes more about making a statement and getting noticed. In the prelude to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, the White House blamed Russian military intelligence for a series of DDoS attacks on Ukrainian government websites. The war in Ukraine has triggered a wave of pro-Russia and pro-Ukrainian hackers who have made political statements and targeted infrastructure in the two countries. Killnet last week claimed responsibility for DDoS attacks on websites of government agencies and private firms in Lithuania. The hackers said it was retaliation for Lithuania blocking the shipment of some goods to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. US officials have been on high alert for months for retaliatory Russian cyberattacks after the Biden administration imposed stiff sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the military had taken over Lysychansk and a number of nearby settlements on Sunday, according to the country's Ministry of Defense. Ukraine's military announced Sunday that it had been ""forced to withdraw"" from the critical city. In his nightly televised address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the retreat from Lysychansk was motivated to save the lives of Ukrainian troops. ""We will rebuild the walls, we will win back the land, and people must be protected above all else,"" he said. Luhansk is one of the two regions that form Donbas, the eastern part of Ukraine where the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists started in 2014. The area has became the key centerpiece of Putin's military ambition in Ukraine after his troops failed to take over Kyiv earlier this year. The fall of Lysychansk shifts Russia closer to achieving the goal of taking over Donbas. ""After heavy fighting for Lysychansk, the Defense Forces of Ukraine were forced to withdraw from their occupied positions and lines,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Sunday on Twitter. Accompanying the announcement was a photo that read: ""Lysychansk: We'll be back."" A Facebook post by the Ukrainian military also cited Russian superiority in weapons, ammunition and personnel in the battle for the city. ""We continue the fight. Unfortunately, steel will and patriotism are not enough for success - material and technical resources are needed,"" that post read. Pro-Russia separatists in the area had already claimed a victory in the battle over Lysychansk. Leonid Pasechnik, the leader of the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), declared the Luhansk region ""liberated."" ""Today is the day we have accomplished what we all have been striving to for eight long years. Today our troops, with the support of the Russian armed forces, liberated the town of Lysychansk, thus completing the liberation of the Republic within its historic borders,"" Pasechnik said. Only Russia and Syria recognize the LPR as independent. Ukraine and its western allies consider it part of the Ukrainian territory, currently under Russian occupation. Video shared by Russian state news outlet Ria Novosti on Saturday purports to show residents installing he old Soviet Union flag at the Memorial to the Memory of the Fallen in Lysychansk. The Institute for the Study of War said Russia will likely establish control over the remaining territory of Luhansk region in coming days. After that, the institute said in its latest update, Russian troops will likely focus on Ukrainian positions in Siversk, west of Lysychansk, before turning inland to Sloviansk and Bakhmut. The Donetsk region military administration said Sunday that Russian forces continued shelling Slovyansk and Bakhmut. At least six people have died and 15 were injured in Sloviansk on Sunday, according to Tetiana Tiurina, the head of the Public Information and Communication Department of Donetsk region. The city of Kramatorsk was also hit with three missile strikes Sunday morning but there were no casualties, according to Ukraine's Donetsk Regional Military Administration. Zelensky said the cities of the Luhansk region were ""the epicenter"" of the hostilities. In his nightly address on Saturday, Zelensky acknowledged that more than 2,600 Ukrainian cities and towns were under Russian control. ""The Russian army continued to fire missiles at our cities,"" Zelensky said, urging people to ""help the army, help volunteers, help everyone who was left alone at this time"" and to use their contacts to ""spread the truth about the war and about the crimes of the occupiers on our land."" Meanwhile, Ukraine forces said they destroyed a Russian military base in the occupied Melitopol in southern Ukraine early Sunday morning, the city's exiled mayor Ivan Fedorov said in a video address. Melitopol fell to Russian control in early March, weeks into the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. According to Fedorov, Ukrainian troops filed ""more than 30 shots exclusively at the military base,"" rendering it ""unable to function."" ""Now the whole city is covered in smoke. This has been going on for three to four hours. Warehouses on the territory of the transport aviation base are burning,"" Fedorov added. The head of the Russia-installed council in the Zaporizhzhia region, Evgeny Balitsky, said in a Telegram post Sunday that ""shells fell on the territory on the airfield"" and that ""there were no casualties."" Russian state news agency RIA Novosti also confirmed the attack, reporting that Ukraine had hit the Aviagorodok area of Melitopol, but did not specify what had been targeted. Russia and Belarus claim Ukrainian strikes against their territory The Russian Defense Ministry also claimed on Sunday that the Ukrainian military launched ""a deliberate strike"" on residential areas of the Russian cities of Belgorod and Kursk. The ministry's spokesperson Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said in a statement that Ukrainian forces targeted the cities with Tochka-U ballistic missiles with cluster munitions and drones. He said three ballistic missiles launched at Belgorod were destroyed by Russian air defense systems in the air, adding that the wreckage of one of the missiles fell on a residential building in the city. Konashenkov also claimed Russian air defense systems destroyed two Ukrainian military drones as they approached the city of Kursk, about 130 km (80 miles) north of Belgorod. CNN has been unable to independently confirm those claims and the Ukrainian military has not yet commented on the strikes. The governor of the Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement posted on his Telegram channel that at least three people were killed, and dozens of residential buildings were damaged by explosions early on Sunday morning. Separately, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Saturday accused Ukraine of launching a missile attack against military facilities on his country two days earlier. In remarks published on the presidential website on Saturday, Lukashenko said Belarusian forces intercepted the missiles. However, he did not provide any evidence of Ukraine's alleged attack. Ukraine's military did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment on Lukashenko's claims.

One of the buildings struck by the strikes was a rehabilitation center for treating Moldovan children with health problems, according to Moldova's Minister of Health Ala Nemerenco. In a statement on Facebook, Nemerenco said that although the building itself was not badly damaged, one employee was killed and five were injured in the attack. The renovated sanatorium gave ""children with health problems in the Republic of Moldova the opportunity to benefit from medical rehabilitation services on the Black Sea coast,"" Nemerenco said. She paid tribute to the facilities' medical staff who were injured and killed in the Russian bombardment. ""These peaceful people made the days of Moldova's children more beautiful; they took care of their rehabilitation with a lot of love and dedication, and we wish them from the bottom of our hearts a total recovery.

No children are thought to have been at the center at the time of the attack. Fighting has raged across the Odesa region, which borders the strategically significant Black Sea, for several weeks. But some Ukrainian officials are cautiously optimistic that the regaining of Snake Island, a Ukrainian outpost on the Black Sea, could mean a reduction of shelling toward Odesa. ""It's now known why the enemy took (Snake) island. They filled the territory with the means of destruction and fired from them,"" state border service spokesman Andrii Demchenko said at a briefing Friday. ""We hope now shelling of the territory of Ukraine will decrease."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Friday that Russia targets civilian areas in Ukraine and repeated the frequent claim that it focuses its air strikes on buildings containing ammunition or training troops. But as with previous such claims after Russian attacks, he failed to provide any evidence that this was the case. Russia has made some slow but significant gains in the east of Ukraine since refocusing its invasion there. An official in the Russian-backed Luhansk People's Republic said on Friday that Russian troops have ""completely taken over"" an oil refinery in the embattled city of Lysychansk, eastern Ukraine, though Ukraine admitted only to a ""partial"" Russian success.

2022-07-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/01/politics/ukraine-assassination-attempts-kherson-resistance-movement/index.html,Recent attacks on pro-Russian officials in southern Ukraine indicate signs of growing resistance movement,"US officials say a trio of assassination attempts targeting pro-Russian officials over the past two weeks suggests a burgeoning resistance movement against pro-Russian authorities occupying parts of southern Ukraine. While it is just a few incidents isolated to the town of Kherson so far, US officials say the resistance could grow into a wider counterinsurgency that would pose a significant challenge to Russia's ability to control newly captured territory across Ukraine. The Kremlin ""faces rising partisan activity in southern Ukraine,"" Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, said during a conference in Washington, DC, on Wednesday. The US believes that Russia does not have enough forces in Kherson to effectively occupy and control the region, one US official said, especially after pulling forces from the area for the fight to the east in Donbas. Another US official told CNN that move may have provided Ukrainian partisans with a window in which to attack locally installed Russian officials. Ukraine has also conducted limited counterattacks near Kherson, further straining Russian forces. The region is critical to Russia's hold on Ukraine's Black Sea coast and controls access to the Crimean peninsula. It's unclear how many Russian forces are in or near Kherson, but an occupation against a hostile local population requires far more soldiers than a peaceful occupation of territory. Russia's leaders have prioritized the military campaign at the expense of any semblance of government. ""It's clearly not something they're able to invest in right now,"" one US official said. Trio of assassination attempts The first attack in Kherson occurred on June 16, when an explosion shattered the windows of a white Audi Q7 SUV. The vehicle was left seriously damaged, but the target of the attack survived. Eugeniy Sobolev, the pro-Russian head of the prison service in occupied Kherson, was hospitalized after the attack, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Less than a week later, a second pro-Russian official in Kherson was targeted. This time, the attack succeeded. On June 24, Dmitry Savluchenko, the pro-Russian official in charge of the Department of Youth and Sports for the Kherson region, was killed, RIA Novosti reported. Serhii Khlan, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian Kherson Civil Military administration, called Savluchenko a ""traitor"" and said he had been blown up in his car. Khlan proclaimed, ""Our partisans have another victory."" On Tuesday, the car of a third pro-Russian official was set on fire in Kherson, according to Russian state news agency Tass, though the official was not injured. It's unclear who committed the attacks. There does not appear to be a central command guiding an organized resistance, officials said, but the attacks have increased in frequency, particularly in the Kherson region, which Russia occupied in March at the beginning of its invasion. A source familiar with Western intelligence was more skeptical about whether the resistance could develop from partisan attacks to a more organized campaign capable of managing the attacks and supplying weapons and instructions So far, the resistance has not dented Russia's control over Kherson, the source familiar with Western intelligence emphasized. But in the long term, the US assesses that Russia will eventually face a counterinsurgency from the local Ukrainian population. ""I think Russia is going to have significant challenges in trying to establish any sort of stable administration for these regions, because likely collaborators -- more prominent ones -- are going to be assassinated and others will be living in fear,"" said Michael Kofman, director for Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, a Washington-based think tank. Making Russian governance difficult On Tuesday, Russian-appointed authorities in the Kherson region arrested the elected Ukrainian mayor of the city, Ihor Kolykhaiev, hours before announcing plans for a referendum to join Russia. The pro-Russian military-civilian administration accused Kolykhaiev of encouraging people to ""believe in the return of neo-Nazism."" Kolykhaeiv's adviser said Russian authorities also had seized hard drives from computers, ransacked safes and searched for documents. Earlier this month, Ukraine's military said ""invaders"" had broken into Kherson State University and abducted the rector. Russian forces have gradually instituted the ruble as the local currency and issued Russian passports. In Mariupol, pro-Russian authorities celebrated the so-called ""liberation"" of the city in May. The Russian-aligned Donetsk People's Republic changed road signs from Ukrainian to Russian and installed a statue of an elderly woman grasping a Soviet flag. Meanwhile, the iconic Mariupol sign painted in Ukrainian colors was repainted in Russian colors. Despite Russia's efforts to eliminate Ukrainian history, ethnicity and nationalism from Kherson and other occupied territories, the Ukrainian population shows a willingness to resist. ""The occupiers and local collaborators are making more and more loud statements about [the] Kherson region joining Russia,"" a Ukrainian official said last week, ""but every day, more and more Ukrainian flags and inscriptions appear in the city."" The attempts to forcibly erase Ukrainian culture and dictate a Russian hegemony have produced the opposite effect in some cases, according to a senior NATO official. ""There have been reports of assassination attempts against some of the quislings that have been put in place to be governors, mayors [and] business leaders,"" said the NATO official. A quisling is a traitor who collaborates with an enemy force, named after a Norwegian official in World War II who collaborated with the Nazis. ""That almost certainly has deterred Russian sympathizers or Russians or whoever they're going to bring in there to take these posts from taking them up in the first place."" As an occupying force in Kherson -- in particular, one that seems intent on maintaining control -- Russia has to provide basic services in the territories it manages, like clean water and trash pickup. But the US assesses that acts of resistances are making it difficult to provide governance and basic services, one of the US officials said. The US knew there was a ""serious resistance network"" within Ukraine that would be able to take over if and when the military had failed, the official said. Before the invasion, the US anticipated the insurgency would emerge, coupled with guerrilla warfare, after a brief period of intense fighting in which Russia prevailed. But the war has now dragged on for months, with many analysts predicting a far lengthier conflict. A senior US official warned a Russian counterpart before the conflict that they would face an insurgency if they invaded Ukraine and tried to occupy territory, the official said. But the warning fell on deaf ears and the invasion proceeded, driven in part by hubris and bad intelligence. Russia believed its forces would be greeted with open arms and would crush any resistance quickly, erroneous fantasies that fell apart quickly but did little to change Russian President Vladimir Putin's calculations. Kofman says it's unclear what type of governing framework Russia will try to create to exert control, but there is no doubt that it intends to retain the territories. After facing prolonged, bloody insurgencies in Afghanistan and Chechnya, the Kremlin knew to anticipate another potential insurgency in Ukraine. ""They did see it coming,"" Kofman said. ""That's why they set up filtration camps and shipped out a lot of the population out of occupied areas.""",14,3.2497802215175793,4.861222019196241,-1.6114417976786615,12
2022-07-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/01/politics/russia-ukraine-dtek-hack/index.html,Russian hackers allegedly target Ukraine's biggest private energy firm,"Russian hackers carried out a ""cyberattack"" on Ukraine's biggest private energy conglomerate in retaliation for its owner's opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine, the firm said Friday. DTEK Group, which owns coal and thermal power plants in various parts of Ukraine, said the goal of the hack was to ""destabilize the technological processes"" of its distribution and generation firms, spread propaganda about the company's operations, and ""to leave Ukrainian consumers without electricity."" ""The cyberattacks didn't have any negative effect on DTEK's operations so far,"" DTEK spokesperson Antonina Antosha told CNN in an email Tuesday. ""All systems operate in a regular mode."" The hacking incident was disclosed days after Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man and DTEK's owner, sued Russia at the European Court of Human Rights for allegedly costing Akhmetov billions of dollars in property rights damages. A Russian-speaking hacking group known as XakNet claimed to have breached DTEK's networks this week and posted screenshots on the Telegram app of purported DTEK data as proof. The hacking group surfaced in March, according to a US and allied government advisory, and has claimed to target Ukrainian officials in support of Russia's war. XakNet has had access to data belonging to an organization that was likely hacked by a Russian cyber espionage group, suggesting a possible link between XakNet and the Russian government, said Alden Wahlstrom a senior analyst at US cybersecurity firm Mandiant, which has investigated some of XakNet's activity. On its Telegram channel, XakNet has mocked and denied the suggestion that it works with the Russian government. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington. The hacking incident coincided with Russian shelling this week of a DTEK-owned thermal power plant in Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, according to DTEK, whose websites says it employs 56,000 people. Microsoft in an April report made the case that Russian hacking has sometimes been used in tandem with kinetic military strikes. A cyberattack hit a Ukrainian broadcast company on March 1, the same day as a Russian missile strike against a TV tower in Kyiv, the report said. Ukrainian energy providers have consistently been the target of Russian hacking teams since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The Justice Department blamed Russia's military intelligence service for cyberattacks on electric utilities in 2015 and 2016 that cut power in parts of Ukraine. The same Russian hacking group in April allegedly targeted electric equipment in an area serving 2 million people in Ukraine, but Ukrainian officials claimed the hack was thwarted. ""The company makes every effort to ensure the stable operation of Ukraine's energy system during the war and to ensure uninterrupted power supply to Ukrainian consumers,"" DTEK said in its statement Friday. This story has been updated with comment from DTEK.",3,4.139247437134146,8.409676052526322,-4.270428615392176,23
2022-06-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/politics/nato-high-readiness-force/index.html,"NATO officials say plan to boost high response force to 300,000 'still a work in progress'","NATO military officials said Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg's announcement earlier this week that 300,000 troops would be placed on high alert across the alliance is something the alliance will work on going forward, rather than an immediate shift. Stoltenberg said on Monday that NATO ""will transform the NATO Response Force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000."" But it now appears that number is more aspirational, and is based on a new model NATO believes will take at least another year to accomplish. The initial announcement appeared to be a seven-fold increase from the 40,000 troops NATO currently has on high alert. Two NATO officials told CNN that number caught many NATO countries' defense chiefs off guard. It was not clear to them, for example, which troops from each member state would need to contribute to that new high-readiness force, or whether enough countries had even been asked or agreed to provide the sufficient forces for it. It was a point of apparent confusion and disjointedness in an otherwise highly choreographed show of unity among the allies. Two senior NATO officials told reporters in a briefing on Thursday that the new high-readiness model will eventually replace the NATO Response Force model, but that it is ""still a work in progress."" ""We know from nations, through our planning process, the number of forces that nations have at their disposal, the readiness that they have,"" one of the officials said. ""So, there will be several iterations of populating this model, but we would not be giving figures for a model if we were not extremely confident that we could deliver on those things. But it's a work in progress."" The high-profile summit saw NATO formalize its invitation to Sweden and Finland to join its alliance Wednesday, a historic expansion of the defense bloc. The group collectively decided to approve countries' applications to join after Turkey dropped its objections Tuesday, paving the way for NATO's most consequential enlargement in decades. The decision will now go to the 30 member states' parliaments and legislatures for final ratification. NATO's leaders said they expected the process to move quickly, allowing for an unprecedentedly swift accession and a show of unity against Putin. The expansion vote, paired with substantial new commitments bolstering NATO's force posture in Europe, combined to make this week's summit in Madrid one of the most productive in recent memory. The alliance endorsed a new ""Strategic Concept"" document that outlines the NATO's goals for the next decade. The document, last updated in 2010, lays out the security challenges facing the defensive alliance while outlining a course of actions. For the first time, the document outlined the China ""challenge,"" saying that the country's ""ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values."" This was the first time the Strategic Concept document mentioned China; the 2010 version made no mention of Beijing. It also states that climate change is ""a defining challenge of our time."" The document identifies Russia as the ""most significant and direct threat to allies' security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area"" and addresses NATO's support for an independent Ukraine. In the 2010 version of the document, Russia was referred to as a ""Euro-Atlantic partner."" The officials indicated that under the new model, many of the troops would remain in their home countries rather than move under the command of NATO's Allied Command Operations. But they would be quickly available to NATO should a security crisis arise, such as if Russia were to attack a member country. Asked what the trigger would be to move those forces to high alert under NATO command, one of the officials would only say it will involve ""indications and warnings"" of a potential attack.",29,6.8557791925851985,0.6332404919956859,6.222538700589513,9
2022-06-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/politics/joe-biden-nato-day-3/index.html,5 takeaways from Joe Biden's trip to two of the most productive foreign summits in years,"President Joe Biden and his fellow NATO leaders departed a highly consequential summit Thursday that left the defense alliance larger, more muscular and more focused. Yet after a pair of high-profile summit meetings in Europe this week, questions persist about Biden's ability to convince both his fellow leaders and the American public that the costs of supporting Ukraine and punishing Russia are still worth bearing. Leader after leader at the two summits -- including Biden -- pledged to support Ukraine for ""as long as it takes,"" but few were willing to offer an actual timeframe for an end to the conflict. That contributed to a sense of foreboding that clouded the many announcements, some highly significant, at the Group of 7 in the Bavarian Alps and later at the NATO gathering in Madrid. Leaders openly warned against the growing fatigue and disinterest in the war as their populations turn away. Here are five takeaways from Biden's trip to the G7 and NATO summits in Europe: The alliance remains united -- for now ""Unity"" was the buzzword this week as leaders sought to demonstrate they remained aligned as the war in Ukraine entered its fifth month. And despite fears of fracture, NATO leaders left Madrid with a renewed sense of purpose after years of wavering on how to approach Russia. The alliance is poised to grow larger after formally inviting Finland and Sweden to join. The path was cleared for the two countries, each with long histories of military non-alignment, after Turkey dropped its objections, giving this summit a somewhat unexpected boost as it commenced. Leaders made major enhancements to NATO's force posture along its eastern edge, increasing the number of high-alert troops by sevenfold. Biden announced new rotational deployments of US troops in the Baltics and Romania, new ships to Spain and planes to the United Kingdom, and for the first time, a permanent Army garrison headquarters in Poland. After dancing around the issue for years, NATO made clear in its updated mission statement that Russia now poses the ""most significant threat to Allied security."" And it mentioned China for the first time, saying the budding partnership between Moscow and Beijing ""runs counter to our values."" Taken together, the accomplishments amount to a foundational shift for the alliance, which has struggled for years to determine the best way to approach Russia. President Vladimir Putin, fearing the eastward expansion of the alliance, now faces a far more united collective. ""He wanted less NATO,"" Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said this week. ""Now President Putin is getting more NATO on his borders."" Zelensky urges allied leaders to help him turn the tide Despite the resolve, it is unclear whether any of the steps taken to respond to the war in Ukraine at this week's meetings in Europe -- new sanctions, more military aid and a reinvigorated NATO -- can change the battlefield momentum that currently favors Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged NATO leaders to help him regain the initiative during an address to the summit Wednesday, pleading for more modern artillery and sustained support to battle the Russians. ""The war should not drag on. To break the advantage of Russian artillery, we need a lot more of these modern systems, modern artillery,"" Zelensky said. Biden said during a news conference he was preparing to unveil $800 million in new security assistance, including the same model of missile defense system that is used to protect airspace in Washington, DC. Other countries made similar commitments. But the weapons still fall short of what Zelensky has requested, and for now appear unlikely to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the war. Instead, leaders hope Russia exhausts its forces and artillery, and is hampered by western sanctions in resupplying. Western leaders still have not defined an endgame in Ukraine Biden offered little indication in his news conference that he believed the conflict will conclude anytime soon. Instead, he suggested Americans would have to stomach high gas prices for at least a while longer. ""As long as it takes, so Russia cannot, in fact, defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine,"" he said. He was repeating a term used throughout this week's summit. ""Ukraine can count on us for as long as it takes,"" Stoltenberg told reporters in Madrid. ""We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian as well as military support for Ukraine, for as long as it takes,"" the G7 leaders said in a joint statement But how long it takes remains unknown, and a point of contention, for western leaders. Some are pushing for a decisive battlefield victory; others believe more robust attempts at brokering a settlement must be made, particularly amid economic fallout at home. ""The consensus is that the war in Ukraine will go on for an extended period of time,"" US director of national intelligence Avril Haines told a conference Wednesday, offering a bleak assessment in the near-term of what has become a grinding conflict. High prices at home remain top of mind during a trip abroad High on leaders' priority list this week was finding a way to mitigate the high cost of gas that is driving frustration among their people and causing them political headaches. ""When we agreed we were going to respond, we acknowledged there was going to be some costs to our people, our imposition of sanctions on Russia,"" Biden said while meeting the Spanish King this week. Yet the scale of the price spikes have surprised many on Biden's team, and have left them in a precarious position months ahead of midterm elections. Finding a way out of the predicament has proved challenging. Biden's attempts so far -- releasing barrels of oil from reserves, chastising oil companies and proposing a gas tax holiday -- have yielded little progress. He did have success in convincing fellow leaders at the G7 to agree to try capping the price of Russian oil, an idea championed by his Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. But how and when that can be accomplished was an unanswered question by the time the summit concluded. He suggested during his news conference the west could use its leverage by not providing insurance for ships carrying the commodity. ""We would not provide insurance for them so they would have great difficulty getting customers,"" he said. And he hinted that one of his aims for when he next travels abroad in the Middle East would be to convince Gulf countries to increase their output -- though he denied asking his hosts in Saudi Arabia specifically to start pumping more oil. ""I've indicated to them that I thought they should be increasing oil production generically, not to the Saudis particularly,"" he said. Biden's troubles at home become magnified by his successes abroad American presidents always have more unilateral leeway on their foreign policy priorities than on their domestic agenda, which usually requires congressional cooperation. For Biden, the phenomenon appears magnified. His muscular approach to arming Ukraine and rallying the west behind Russian sanctions bears little resemblance to his struggles advancing domestic policy at home. Some Democrats have privately complained Biden doesn't appear willing to fight as hard for his domestic priorities, like restoring abortion and voting rights, than he is for Ukraine. In some ways, the disparate level of success at home and abroad is exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Biden's objectives on the foreign stage -- to punish Russia -- are making things harder for him domestically, since higher gas prices are eroding his political capital. He is not the only leader facing severe political headwinds. The British Prime Minister, the French President and the German Chancellor are each confronting voter dissatisfaction at home. Yet Biden seems particularly plagued by a sour national mood he seems unable to improve and even a Democratic Party that has begun quietly questioning his leadership. As he returns to Washington on Thursday, he will find the challenges he left behind last week haven't gone anywhere.",29,1.1321677678978308,5.817036103248477,-4.684868335350647,16
2022-06-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/europe/snake-island-russia-ukraine-invasion-intl/index.html,Russian forces have withdrawn from Snake Island. But both sides give different accounts,"Russian troops have left Snake Island in the Black Sea, the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Thursday, after they carried out what they said was a ""successful"" operation. The small but strategic territory was the scene of one of the opening salvos of the war in Ukraine, with demands from a Russian warship calling for the Ukrainian defenders to surrender, who boldly replied with ""Russian warship, go f*** yourself."" Known as Zmiinyi Ostriv in Ukrainian, Snake Island lies around 30 miles (48 kilometers) off the coast of Ukraine and is close to the sea lanes leading to the Bosphorus and Mediterranean. Moscow had never laid claim to Snake Island before this year, and it's a long way from any part of the Russian mainland. It's more than 180 miles from Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, and so there is no geographical or historical basis for Russia to claim it now. On Monday, the Ukrainian military said it hit a second missile system on the island, as well as multiple Russian personnel in their efforts to keep them at bay. In a short post on Telegram on Thursday the Operation Command South of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said that ""the enemy hastily evacuated the remnants of the garrison in two speedboats and probably left the island."" Satellite images of the island taken on Thursday by Maxar Technologies showed that Russian military forces have left the island. Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in a Telegram post that Ukraine's armed forces had ""conducted a remarkable operation."" The Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valeriy Zaluzhniy, later said on Telegram that the ""occupiers"" had left after being ""unable to withstand the fire of our artillery, missile and air strikes."" He paid tribute to those behind the manufacturing of the Ukrainian self-propelled howitzer 'Bodogan,' saying it ""played an important role in the liberation of the island,"" and said ""Thanks to foreign partners for the provided means of destruction."" Zaluzhniy also thanked the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the Odesa region, which Snake Island is a part of, ""who took the maximum measures to liberate a strategically important part of our territory."" Ukraine's armed forces had ""achieved their goal"" in driving Russian troops from Snake Island, spokeswoman for the Ukrainian Military's Southern Command, Natalia Humenyuk, said, but she cautioned it may be ""too early"" to establish an outpost there. ""We can state that a powerful rocket artillery assault that we have been conducting for some time, during the entire military operation, on this small enemy outpost has achieved its goal. They truly understood that they have to do the right thing, gathered their things and got out as soon as they could,"" Humenyuk told Ukrainian broadcaster Espresso TV. Humenyuk reported the island remains engulfed in heavy smoke as explosions continue. Although the Ukrainian military saw Russian troops evacuate using speedboats, Humenyuk said investigation needs to take place into possible ""diversion tools left behind"" before claiming back the island. ""Our forces haven't landed on the island yet,"" she added, clarifying it is not clear if Russian troops had withdrawn completely. Humenyuk suggested the Russian military set anti-air missile systems and radar station on fire ""to cover their tracks."" ""As soon as they understood all these systems were being targeted by us effectively and could not serve them anymore, they realized they had to fold their outpost and get out,"" Humenyuk added. However, Russia gave a slightly different narrative of the events on the island. Russian army spokesman Igor Konashenkov said at a briefing that its forces left the island ""as a gesture of goodwill."" He added that ""the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation finished fulfilling the assigned tasks in Snake Island and withdrew the garrison that had been operating there."" Konashenkov intimated that the removal of Russian troops should allow an easing for the passage of grain, ""this solution will prevent Kyiv from speculating on an impending grocery crisis citing the inability to export grain due to total control of the northwestern part of the Black Sea by Russia."" But the Ukrainian government rejected Russia's version of events, with Yermak denouncing the explanation. ""In Russia, they say about the alleged withdrawal of troops from Snake Island and present it as a 'gesture of goodwill.' Like, Russia does not interfere with humanitarian corridors for the export of Ukrainian grain. But all this is a complete fake,"" Yermak said on his official Telegram channel. ""First, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have knocked the Russians out of Snake Island,"" Yermak added. ""Secondly, the Russians are shelling warehouses with our grain. In the morning, a warehouse in the Dnipropetrovsk region was fired upon."" Snake Island is part of the Odesa region, through which much of Ukraine's agricultural wealth travels to global markets. In normal times, Ukraine would export around three-quarters of the grain it produces. According to data from the European Commission, about 90% of these exports were shipped by sea, from Ukraine's Black Sea ports. Ukraine's defense intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said in May that whoever holds Snake Island controls ""the surface and to some extent the air situation in southern Ukraine."" ""Whoever controls the island can block the movement of civilian vessels in all directions to the south of Ukraine at any time,"" Budanov added. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky flew to Snake Island, where there are no voters but some sheep, to emphasize that it mattered. ""This island, like the rest of our territory, is Ukrainian land, and we will defend it with all our might,"" he said.",14,7.438617040379847,5.621569533861549,1.817047506518298,29
2022-06-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/europe/lithuania-border-militia-russia-intl/index.html,'How can you trust Russia?' Nervous Lithuanians sign up for border militia,"Having a neighbor like Russia at the end of the street means 59-year-old Vytas Grudzinskas doesn't get much rest. ""I can see the soldiers best at night,"" he says, pointing to a patch of green behind his neighbor's garden. ""They have a shooting range they use over there behind that field. In the afternoon, you can hear the guns,"" he said. Grudzinskas has his own weapon, a machine gun, which he keeps locked in a cupboard, close at hand -- although his guard dog, a Maltese terrier, might be less effective in battle. The small city of Kybartai where Grudzinska lives lies inside both NATO and the European Union but also along one of the world's hottest borders -- the Suwalki corridor. This tract of land, about 60 miles wide, is sandwiched between Russia's heavily fortified, nuclear-armed, Baltic bolthole of Kaliningrad and its ally, Belarus. The pass -- viewed by many analysts as a weak point within NATO -- is caught in a pincer grip between Kremlin troops. The fear is that if Ukraine fell, Russia would advance through it next, possibly cutting off the Baltic states in days. The scars of Soviet occupation run deep in this part of Europe. Tens of thousands of Lithuanians were forcibly deported to gulags in Siberia and the far north by the Soviets in the 1940s and 1950s. Almost 30,000 Lithuanian prisoners perished in the forced labor camps. ""My father was sent to Sakhalin in Russia's far west for 15 years,"" said Grudzinskas. ""He ate grass the first year to survive."" So, when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Grudzinskas joined Lithuania's century-old volunteer militia -- the Riflemen -- and took up arms in his own backyard. That means he's the first line of defense if the Kremlin's troops, stationed 60 feet away in the Russian exclave, put one foot on NATO soil. ""How can you trust Russia? With our history?"" he asked. ""Of course, I'm scared. How could I not be?"" he added. ""My family is here. I built this house with my bare hands."" The 103-year-old Riflemen militia has seen its numbers balloon since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, according to its commanding officer. Currently there are about 12,000 volunteer members, said Egidijus Papeckys, commander of the Riflemen's 4th Regional Command. And that number is increasing each month by tenfold, he said. Since the first days of the Ukraine war, the number of new recruits seeking to join each month has risen from 10 to 12 to more than 100. At his headquarters in the city of Marijampole, deep in the Suwalki corridor, Papeckys shows off some of the arsenal at his unit's disposal, including assault rifles, handguns and grenade launchers. The 51-year-old is also desperate to avoid a return to Russian rule. His father was sent to Siberia, as were his wife's relatives. ""We remember the Soviet occupation, and we do not like to be occupied any more. We are free people,"" Papeckys said. At a swearing-in ceremony held on the 103rd anniversary of the Riflemen in the neighboring city of Kalvarija, new member Karolis Baranauskas says he was always interested in the organization but that the war in Ukraine called him to action. Although he was born in 1990, the year Lithuania became independent from the Soviet Union, he says that ""every Lithuanian knows that Russia is a threat. The recent events prove that."" To better protect the Baltics, NATO has radically overhauled its defense planning in this part of the world, announcing ahead of a summit in Madrid this week that it would increase its presence in the region enough to repel any attack in real time, rather than sending in troops to recapture territory once it's been seized. That will mean thousands more troops, which Lithuania would like to see based permanently around the small country's 621-mile-long borders with Belarus and Russia. Deputy Minister of Defense Margiris Abukevicius concedes it could take two years for such troops to be in place. But he says there's now an understanding that military capabilities need a substantial upgrade around Suwalki and elsewhere. The corridor, also known as the Suwalki Gap, has always been a cause of worry, according to Abukevicius. It's understood to be a ""weak point"" by the Baltics and NATO. ""In the current situation we understand the vulnerability much clearer,"" he told CNN in an interview on Tuesday at the Ministry of Defense in Vilnius, the capital. ""I think NATO understands that and takes decisions,"" he said. ""I really hope that NATO's summit this week will give a very strong response and a very clear direction where NATO's long-term adaptation should go."" At the same time, Lithuania says it has been fending off ongoing Russian cyberattacks on its state institutions and private sector in recent days following its decision last week to block some goods like grain and steel -- which are subject to EU sanctions -- from being transported by train into Kaliningrad. Although cyberattacks by Russian hackers are relatively common in Lithuania, Abukevicius says the blockade was the ""trigger point."" ""We are seeing an increase in activity at state institutions against some critical operators -- especially transport and the media,"" Abukevicius said.

2022-06-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/politics/joe-biden-nato-day-2/index.html,NATO formally invites Finland and Sweden to join alliance,"NATO formalized its invitation to Sweden and Finland to join its alliance Wednesday, a historic expansion of the defense bloc that directly undercuts Russian President Vladimir Putin's aims as his war in Ukraine grinds ahead. The group collectively decided to approve countries' applications to join after Turkey dropped its objections Tuesday, paving the way for NATO's most consequential enlargement in decades. ""The accession of Finland and Sweden will make them safer, NATO stronger, and the Euro-Atlantic area more secure. The security of Finland and Sweden is of direct importance to the Alliance, including during the accession process,"" the statement said. The decision will now go to the 30 member states' parliaments and legislatures for final ratification. NATO's leaders said they expected the process to move quickly, allowing for an unprecedentedly swift accession and a show of unity against Putin. The leaders entered Wednesday's talks propelled by a diplomatic victory after Turkey dropped its objections to the two nations joining NATO, setting the stage for the two longtime neutral countries to enter the defensive bloc. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg called the formal invitation from the alliance to Sweden and Finland to join the defense bloc a ""historic decision."" ""The agreement concluded last night by Turkey, Finland and Sweden paved the way for this decision,"" the secretary general said in a news conference. He recounted how two rounds of talks were held by senior officials in Brussels under his auspices in the advance of Monday's consequential meeting between Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Turkey agreed on Tuesday to drop its objections to their membership bids, removing a major hurdle to them joining NATO. The expansion vote, paired with substantial new commitments bolstering NATO's force posture in Europe, combined to make this week's summit in Madrid one of the most productive in recent memory. The alliance endorsed a new ""Strategic Concept"" document that outlines the NATO's goals for the next decade. The document, last updated in 2010, lays out the security challenges facing the defensive alliance while outlining a course of actions. For the first time, the document outlined the China ""challenge,"" saying that the country's ""ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values."" This was the first time the Strategic Concept document mentioned China; the 2010 version made no mention of Beijing. It also states that climate change is ""a defining challenge of our time."" The document identifies Russia as the ""most significant and direct threat to allies' security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area"" and addresses NATO's support for an independent Ukraine. In the 2010 version of the document, Russia was referred to as a ""Euro-Atlantic partner."" The outcome is exactly what Putin was hoping to fend off when he invaded Ukraine more than four months ago. ""I said Putin's looking for the Finlandization of Europe. He's going to get the NATOization of Europe. And that is exactly what he didn't want, but exactly what needs to be done to guarantee security for Europe. And I think it's necessary,"" US President Joe Biden said when he arrived at the summit site in Madrid. Biden announces strengthening of NATO forces Biden and fellow NATO leaders assembled in the Spanish capital to unveil a significant strengthening of forces along the alliance's eastern flank as Russia's war in Ukraine shows no signs of slowing. Speaking alongside Stoltenberg, Biden listed new troop movements, equipment shipments and military installations meant to demonstrate the importance of security in the face of Moscow's aggression. ""The United States and our allies, we are going to step up -- we are stepping up. We're proving that NATO is more needed now than it ever has been and is as important as it ever has been,"" Biden said. He said the US would establish a permanent headquarters for the Fifth Army Corps in Poland, maintain an extra rotational brigade of 3,000 troops in Romania, enhance rotational deployments to the Baltic states, send two more F-35 fighter jet squadrons to the United Kingdom and station additional air defense and other capabilities in Germany and Italy. ""Together with our allies, we are going to make sure that NATO is ready to meet threats from all directions -- across every domain, land, air and the sea,"" Biden said. The United States did not convey to Russia its plans to bolster its force posture in Europe ahead of time. ""There has been no communication with Moscow about these changes nor is there a requirement to do that,"" John Kirby, the NSC coordinator for strategic communications, said after Biden announced the series of measures. A second official told reporters the announcements did not violate any agreements between Russia and NATO, which stipulate parameters for positioning troops in Europe. ""The decision to permanently forward station the Five Corps headquarters forward command post does not, you know, is consistent with that commitment and our understanding of the NATO Russia founding act,"" said Celeste Wallander, United States assistant secretary of defense for international affairs. Zelensky asks what Ukraine has to do to join NATO Yet even if Putin's aims have backfired and the conflict grinds on, momentum is favoring Russia at the moment. That has left Biden and fellow western leaders this week searching for ways to alter the trajectory of the war. Despite enthusiasm at the summit for NATO's two newest members, another leader -- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky -- voiced frustration that his country's NATO ambitions have been ignored, despite coming under siege by Russia. Addressing the NATO summit in Madrid virtually, Zelensky asked rhetorically, ""Has Ukraine not paid enough"" to join the alliance and review its open door policy. ""Is our contribution to the defense of both Europe and the whole civilization still insufficient?"" he asked. ""What else is needed then?"" Ukraine has sought unsuccessfully to join NATO for years, hampered by concerns over provoking Russia and other issues related to its governance practices. Speaking after Zelensky's address, Stoltenberg said the alliance welcomed the speech. ""Ukraine can count on us for as long as it takes,"" Stoltenberg stressed to journalists. He commended Zelensky's ""leadership and courage"" and called the Ukrainian leader ""an inspiration to us all."" Alliance turns the pressure up on Russia but wary of effects back home Already this week, the US and European nations have slapped new rounds of sanctions on Moscow, banned new imports of its gold and agreed to limit the price of its oil. New rounds of security assistance, including a US-provided missile defense system, have been added to the queue of artillery and ammunition flowing in Ukraine. Whether any of that is enough to fundamentally alter the way the war is going remains to be seen. Zelensky told leaders attending the G7 summit in Germany he wanted their help staging a major initiative to win the war by the end of the year. In an interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto on ""Newsroom"" Wednesday, Kirby pushed back on the idea that the US would lean on Zelensky to give up territory to Russia in order to end the war. ""This victory has got to be decided by President Zelensky, and he gets to decide what that looks like for his country. Our job is to make sure he can continue to defend himself,"" Kirby said. Leaders worry the growing cost of the war, seen in rising gas and food prices, could lead to diminished support for Ukraine in the months ahead. A few have warned that fatigue is setting in, adding to the growing concerns that the alliance could fracture. ""When we agreed we were going to respond, we acknowledged there was going to be some costs to our people, our imposition of sanctions on Russia. But our people have stood together. They've stood up and they've stood strong,"" Biden said Tuesday when he was meeting with King Felipe VI at the Royal Palace in Madrid. It was during that meeting Biden received word Turkey was dropping its objections to Finland and Sweden's applications to join NATO, ending a months-long standoff with NATO's most challenging member. In order to get the deal struck before the summit, Biden dangled the prospect of a formal bilateral meeting with Erdoğan in a phone call on Tuesday morning. The leaders met Wednesday to discuss the myriad issues that have caused the relationship between Washington and Ankara to sour over the past several years. ""I want to particularly thank you for what you did, putting together the situation with regard to Finland and Sweden, and all the incredible work you're going to try to get the grain ... out of Ukraine,"" Biden told Erdogan. Biden also met jointly with Japan's Prime Minister and South Korea's President to focus on the threat from North Korea. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and President Yoon Suk Yeol are invited guests of the NATO summit, but their countries' ties have deteriorated recently amid disputes over wartime histories, making the joint meeting with Biden a rarity.",29,3.9947313621566067,0.7455027342223273,3.2492286279342792,9
2022-06-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/europe/nato-sweden-finland-summit-explainer-intl/index.html,"Sweden and Finland are on the cusp of joining NATO. Here's why that matters, and what comes next","Sweden and Finland are set formally to end decades of neutrality and join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in a historic breakthrough for the alliance that deals a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The last major hurdle to the two nations' entry to the bloc was removed when Turkey dropped its opposition on Tuesday. That breakthrough came during a NATO summit in Madrid that has already become one of the most consequential meetings in the history of the military alliance. The two countries are now expected to become full NATO members quickly, shoring up the bloc's eastern flank within months of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Here's all you need to know about why the move happened, what comes next and why it matters. What are the latest developments? Sweden and Finland both announced their intention to join NATO in May, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused a sudden shift in attitudes toward joining the bloc. That announcement was welcomed by almost all of NATO's leaders -- but there was one significant obstacle. Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not looking at both countries joining NATO ""positively,"" accusing them of housing Kurdish ""terrorist organizations."" Under NATO rules, just one member state can veto a new applicant's membership. However, a big diplomatic breakthrough between the three countries took place at the NATO summit in Madrid on Tuesday. Turkey signed a trilateral memorandum with Finland and Sweden, lifting its opposition and officially welcoming them to join the bloc. ""In NATO, we have always shown that whatever our differences, we can always sit down, find common ground and resolve any issues. NATO's open door policy has been an historic success,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told journalists in Madrid. On Wednesday, NATO formally invited Sweden and Finland to join, kickstarting a multistage process that will end with both countries holding full membership. What happens next? Stoltenberg said Wednesday that he expects Sweden and Finland to become members of the military alliance quickly. The invitation sparks a seven-step accession process. Key moments along that path include talks between NATO and the candidate countries. The candidates must formally accept the obligations of membership, and then current member states sign an Accession Protocol, before individually ratifying it back home. ""We need a ratification process in 30 parliaments -- that always takes some time but I expect also that to go rather quickly because allies are ready to try to make that ratification process happen as quickly as possible,"" Stoltenberg explained Wednesday. After that, the candidate country is formally invited to accede to the Washington Treaty, the founding document of the alliance. NATO has an ""open door"" policy -- any country can be invited to join if it expresses an interest, as long as it is able and willing to uphold the principles of the bloc's founding treaty. The ratification process usually takes about a year, from the signing of the Accession Protocol by existing members to the country joining the Washington Treaty. But the war in Ukraine has added unprecedented urgency to Sweden and Finland's membership, and the timeline could be accelerated accordingly. How have leaders reacted? US President Joe Biden praised the breakthrough with Turkey, saying it sent a clear signal to Russia that NATO was united and growing. Sweden and Finland's ""decision to move away from neutrality and the tradition of neutrality to join the NATO alliance is going to make us stronger and more secure and NATO stronger,"" Biden said. ""We are sending an unmistakable message in my view... that NATO is strong, united, and the steps we are taking during this summit are going to further augment our collective strength."" Biden said the two Nordic countries' accession was a sign Putin's aims had backfired. ""Putin was looking for the Finlandization of Europe,"" he said, referring to the so-called Finlandization dynamic that saw Russia dominant over the foreign policy of its smaller neighbor for decades. ""He's going to get the NATOization of Europe, and that is exactly what he did not want, that's exactly what needs to be done to guarantee security for Europe. And I think it's necessary,"" Biden said. The move was met with delight across the countries that make up NATO's eastern front, many of which have expressed concern that they could be next in Russia's crosshairs if it is successful in Ukraine. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said the step was ""significant,"" and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda called it ""wonderful news."" What does NATO membership entail? The reason most countries join NATO is because of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which stipulates that all signatories consider an attack on one member an attack against all. Article 5 has been a cornerstone of the alliance since it was founded in 1949 as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. The point of the treaty, and Article 5 specifically, was to deter the Soviets from attacking liberal democracies that lacked military strength. Article 5 guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance -- including the massive US military -- can be used to protect any single member nation, such as smaller countries that would be defenseless without their allies. Iceland, for example, has no standing army. Former Swedish leader Carl Bildt told CNN didn't foresee new big military bases being built in either country if they joined. He said joining the alliance would probably mean more joint military training and planning between Finland, Sweden and the 30 current members. Swedish and Finnish forces could also participate in other NATO operations around the globe, such as those in the Baltic states, where several bases have multinational troops. ""There's going to be preparations for contingencies as part of deterring any adventures that the Russians might be thinking of,"" Bildt said. ""The actual change is going to be fairly limited."" Why haven't Finland and Sweden already joined NATO? While other Nordic countries like Norway, Denmark and Iceland were original members of the alliance, Sweden and Finland did not join the pact for historic and geopolitical reasons. Both Finland, which declared independence from Russia in 1917 after the Bolshevik revolution, and Sweden adopted neutral foreign policy stances during the Cold War, refusing to align with either the Soviet Union or the United States. Sweden's policy of neutrality goes back to the early 1800s, when the country steadfastly stayed out of European conflicts. Its King Gustav XIV formally adopted that neutral status in 1834, according to NATO, and Sweden declared a policy of ""non-belligerency"" during World War II -- allowing Nazi troops to pass through its land into Finland, while also accepting Jewish refugees. Sweden opted to maintain its neutral status after the war ended. Finland's neutrality has historically proved more difficult, as it shared a long border with an authoritarian superpower. A Finno-Soviet treaty known as the Agreement of Friendship, signed in 1948 and extended on occasion through the decades, prohibited Finland from joining any military alliance considered hostile to the USSR, or from allowing a Western attack through Finnish territory. To keep the peace, Finns adopted an arrangement sometimes called Finlandization, in which leaders acceded to Soviet demands from time to time. The term was coined during the Cold War and has been applied to other countries in which a superpower exerts control over smaller neighboring states. Both countries' balancing acts effectively ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Sweden and Finland joined the European Union together in 1995 and gradually aligned their defense policies with the West, while still avoiding joining NATO outright. How Russia's invasion changed everything Sweden and Finland have been inching toward the West on security issues since joining the EU shortly after the end of the Cold War. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine dramatically accelerated that process, pushing them to pull the trigger on NATO membership. If the Kremlin was willing to invade Ukraine -- a country with 44 million people, a GDP of about $155 billion, and armed forces of 200,000 active troops -- what would stop Putin from invading smaller countries like Finland or Sweden? ""Everything changed when Russia invaded Ukraine,"" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said in April. ""People's mindset in Finland, also in Sweden, changed and shifted very dramatically."" Since the invasion of Ukraine in February, Finnish public support for joining NATO has leaped from around 30% to nearly 80% in some polls. The majority of Swedes also approve of their country joining the alliance, according to opinion polls there. How has Russia reacted? Russia lambasted the May decision by Finland and Sweden to seek to join the alliance. Its Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said at the time that the move would be a ""mistake"" with ""far-reaching consequences,"" according to Russian state news agency TASS. That followed similar threats from high-ranking Moscow officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said after the announcement that ""NATO expansion does not make the world more stable and secure."" He added that Russia's reaction would depend on ""how far and how close to our borders the military infrastructure will move."" Russia currently shares about 755 miles of land border with five NATO members, according to the alliance. Finland's accession would mean that a nation with which Russia shares an 830-mile border would become formally militarily aligned with the United States. The addition of Finland and Sweden would also benefit the alliance, which would frustrate Russia. Both are serious military powers, despite their small populations. But Putin has so far been more muted in his rhetoric than some of his officials. Last month he said that ""Russia has no problems with these states,"" adding that the expansion of NATO ""does not pose a direct threat to Russia."" ""But the expansion of military infrastructure into this territory will certainly cause our response,"" he added at the Collective Security Treaty Organization in Moscow. ""We will see what it will be based on the threats that will be created for us."" Why is Russia so opposed to NATO? Putin sees the alliance as a defense against Russia, despite the fact that it spent much of the post-Soviet era focusing on issues like terrorism and peacekeeping. Before Putin invaded Ukraine, he made clear his belief that NATO had edged too close to Russia and should be stripped back to its borders of the 1990s, before some countries that either neighbor Russia or were ex-Soviet states joined the military alliance. Ukraine's desire to join NATO, and its status as a NATO partner -- seen as a step on the way to",29,0.7568094739446016,0.5731084347658827,0.18370103917871894,13
2022-06-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/politics/joe-biden-g7-nato/index.html,"Turkey drops objections to Finland and Sweden joining NATO, removing major hurdle to two nations joining the alliance","Finnish President Sauli Niinistö said on Tuesday that Turkey has agreed to support Finland and Sweden's NATO membership bids, removing a major hurdle to the two countries joining the alliance. Niinistö said in a statement that a joint memorandum on the matter was signed by Turkey, Finland and Sweden on Tuesday in Madrid ahead of what is shaping up to be a critical summit. The joint memorandum underscores the commitment of Finland, Sweden and Turkey ""to extend their full support against threats to each other's security,"" Niinistö said. ""The concrete steps of our accession to NATO will be agreed by the NATO allies during the next two days, but that decision is now imminent,"" he added. US and European officials had been eyeing the summit for potential progress in moving Finland and Sweden's applications forward to join NATO. The two nations formally applied to be part of the security alliance in May, propelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had said repeatedly Turkey wouldn't support the bids, accusing the two countries of harboring members of the separatist militant Kurdistan's Workers Party, also known as PKK, which Turkey views as a terrorist organization. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said he is ""confident"" that Finland and Sweden will be able to successfully join NATO after the signing of the trilateral memorandum of understanding. ""I'm pleased to announce that we now have an agreement that paves the way for Finland and Sweden to join NATO. Turkey, Finland and Sweden have signed a memorandum that addresses Turkey's concerns, including around arms exports, and the fight against terrorism,"" Stoltenberg said, speaking to journalists in Madrid following the signing of the memorandum. On Wednesday, allied leaders will then decide whether to invite Finland and Sweden to join NATO, he said, adding that after this decision a ratification process will need to take place in all NATO capitals. The NATO chief said that following the signing of this trilateral memorandum however he was ""confident"" that Sweden and Finland becoming NATO members is ""something that will take place."" US President Joe Biden and Erdoğan spoke on the phone ahead of the summit and are expected to meet on Wednesday, said Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. ""We do expect at some point tomorrow, President Erdogan and President Biden have the chance to talk,"" Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One, but added that details of the meeting are still being worked out. ""There's not a fixed time or framework for the meeting, but they'll have a chance to spend some time together,"" he said, noting that they will discuss ""strategic issues"" between the two countries. As recently as earlier on Tuesday, Erdoğan had told reporters that he had spoken with Biden over the phone before leaving for Madrid, and said Sweden and Finland's applications to join NATO will be top of mind, Erdoğan said. ""The PKK will be on our agenda in my bilateral meetings. We will explain our position to Sweden and Finland once again. The PKK should be prevented from acting in these countries,"" he said, adding, ""If they are to become a member of NATO, they have to address Turkey's security concerns. We do not want dry words, we want results."" A critical summit Biden arrived in Spain on Tuesday for a NATO summit expected to significantly bolster the alliance's defense posture along its eastern edge, including ramping up troop levels and positioning heavy equipment, as Western leaders contemplate the next phase of the war in Ukraine. The announcements expected over the course of the two-day summit would harden the collective's defenses as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its fifth month, including scaling up the number of troops on high alert to 300,000 -- a sevenfold increase. Not since the Cold War has NATO made such significant enhancements to its posture. The announcements come amid mounting concerns that the West's resolve in confronting Russia could soon fracture amid rising energy prices and waning interest in the grinding conflict. ""The alliance is strengthening its posture, is dealing with the threats and strengthening our posture against the threats from the east, and challenges from the south. NATO is focused on all directions and domains land, air and sea,"" Biden said shortly after he arrived. Speaking alongside the Spanish prime minister, Biden detailed plans to add two US destroyers based at the Rota Naval Station in Spain, bringing the total number of US destroyers based there to six. ""As I said before the war started, if Putin attacked Ukraine, the United States would enhance our force posture in Europe and respond to the reality of a new European security environment,"" he said. ""Together, the new commitments will constitute an impressive display of allied unity and resolve and NATO's 360-degree approach to our security,"" he continued. Biden and his fellow leaders are eager to change the momentum on the ground in Ukraine, where Russia continues to make gains in the East. At the same time, rising energy prices have put pressure on leaders to find a resolution to the conflict. On Tuesday, his administration announced new sanctions on Moscow, including implementing a ban on new imports of Russian gold that was agreed to at the G7 summit. A missile strike Monday on a shopping mall in the in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk was a reminder of Russia's continued brutality. ""Russia's attack on civilians at a shopping mall is cruel. We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people,"" Biden wrote on Twitter. ""As demonstrated at the G7 Summit, the US along with our allies and partners will continue to hold Russia accountable for such atrocities and support Ukraine's defense."" Biden arrives to the NATO gathering after wrapping up final meetings with G7 leaders in Germany, where the Ukraine crisis dominated conversations among leaders. Agreements on sanctions and trying the limit the price of Russian oil were expected to come out of the gathering. Biden met Tuesday morning with Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom on the margins of the G7, which is taking place in Germany's Bavaria region. The group has played the most significant role in orchestrating the Western response to the war in Ukraine, though differences in opinion exist over how and when to engage Russian President Vladimir Putin in negotiations to end the war. New announcements on food security G7 leaders are announcing up to $5 billion funding in global food security Tuesday in the latest effort to counter global effects from the war in Ukraine, more than half of which will come from the United States. As part of Tuesday's announcement, the Biden administration is committing $2.76 billion ""to support efforts in over 47 countries and regional organizations,"" including $2 billion in direct humanitarian aid and $760 million ""for sustainable, near and medium-term food assistance to help enhance the resilience and productivity of food systems around the world, particularly in vulnerable regions,"" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday. According to White House estimates, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent destruction of agriculture equipment and blockade of grain shipments will push up to 40 million people into poverty in 2022. The Biden administration has attempted a number of stopgap measures to move the grain and avert a ""catastrophic food shortage"" in parts of the world. ""Obviously, Putin's actions have been at the core, and the thing from which you can draw a direct line to all of the vulnerabilities that we're seeing around the world in terms of food security -- his actions have strangled food and agricultural production, using food as a weapon of war,"" the official said. ""This is just one piece of our efforts, and we're committed to do everything we can, both as the United States and the G7, to work with partners around the world to address."" The US's commitment will come from the second Ukraine supplemental assistance package lawmakers passed last month, and is expected to be allocated and delivered by the end of the fiscal year. According to the official, leaders also discussed ""a range of approaches"" to get Ukraine's grain to market and address global shortages, adding the issue was ""at the very top of the list of priorities the leaders have with respect to addressing the food security challenge."" Tuesday's announcement comes on the last day of the G7 Summit in Schloss Elmau, Germany, where leaders are also expected to condemn the harms caused by China's ""non-transparent market distorting industrial practices,"" in a communique wrapping the summit. Crucial NATO summit begins Tuesday The President arrived in Madrid in the afternoon for a summit where leaders are expected to endorse a new ""Strategic Concept"" that outlines the defense alliance's goals for the next decade. These priorities include ""building resilience against transnational threats including cyber and climate"" and ""deepening partnerships with democratic partners in Europe and Asia in order to strengthen the rules-based international order,"" the White House says. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday the alliance would scale up the number of troops on high alert to 300,000, a sevenfold increase that reflects the grinding war in Ukraine. Stoltenberg said Russia had walked away from any partnership with NATO, and the group was obligated to respond. ""They have chosen confrontation instead of dialogue. We regret that -- but of course, then we need to respond to that reality,"" he said. Biden described NATO as ""united and galvanized"" Tuesday but acknowledged the growing costs of the grinding war in Ukraine during a brief photo-op with Spanish King Felipe VI. ""We are ready to face threats of Russian aggression because frankly there's no choice,"" he said, calling Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""the most significant abuse of power since World War II."" ""Some people thought it was not likely to happen again but it did. But we responded. We responded in unison,"" he said. ""When we agreed we were going to respond, we acknowledged there was going to be some costs to our people, our imposition of sanctions on Russia. But our people have stood together. They've stood up and they've stood strong,"" he said. The President and first lady Jill Biden will then attend a dinner Tuesday evening for leaders attending the NATO summit, which will be hosted by King Felipe VI and Her Majesty Queen Letizia of Spain. Challenges at home and abroad The summit comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine stretches into its fifth month and as the US looks to keep allies united in its support for Ukraine and sustain the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin. But it also comes as",29,1.009380728908415,4.284902554091216,-3.2755218251828015,2
2022-06-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/politics/white-house-ukraine-projection/index.html,Biden officials privately doubt that Ukraine can win back all of its territory,"White House officials are losing confidence that Ukraine will ever be able to take back all of the land it has lost to Russia over the past four months of war, US officials told CNN, even with the heavier and more sophisticated weaponry the US and its allies plan to send. Advisers to President Joe Biden have begun debating internally how and whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should shift his definition of a Ukrainian ""victory"" -- adjusting for the possibility that his country has shrunk irreversibly. US officials emphasized to CNN that this more pessimistic assessment does not mean the US plans to pressure Ukraine into making any formal territorial concessions to Russia in order to end the war. There is also hope that Ukrainian forces will be able to take back significant chunks of territory in a likely counteroffensive later this year. A congressional aide familiar with the deliberations told CNN that a smaller Ukrainian state is not inevitable. ""Whether Ukraine can take back these territories is in large part, if not entirely, a function of how much support we give them,"" the aide said. He noted that Ukraine has formally asked the US for a minimum of 48 multiple launch rocket systems, but to date has only been promised eight from the Pentagon. And not everyone in the administration is as worried -- some believe Ukrainian forces could again defy expectations, as they did in the early days of the war when they repelled a Russian advance on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. National security adviser Jake Sullivan has remained highly engaged with his Ukrainian counterparts and spent hours on the phone last week discussing Ukrainian efforts to recapture territory with Ukraine's defense chief and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, officials familiar with the call told CNN. The growing pessimism comes as Biden is meeting with US allies in Europe, where he will try to convey strength and optimism about the trajectory of the war as he rallies leaders to stay committed to arming and supporting Ukraine amid the brutal fight. ""We have to stay together. Putin has been counting on from the beginning, that somehow NATO and the G7 would splinter, but we haven't and we're not going to,"" Biden said Sunday while at the G7 summit in the Bavarian Alps. The administration announced another $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine last week, including additional rocket launch systems, artillery ammunition and patrol boats. The US is also expected to announce as soon as this week that it has purchased an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, called a NASAMS, for Ukrainian forces. Biden indicated in an op-ed earlier this month that he is committed to helping Ukraine gain the upper hand on the battlefield so that it has leverage in negotiations with Russia. The mood has shifted over the last several weeks, though, as Ukraine has struggled to repel Russia's advances in the Donbas and has suffered staggering troop losses, reaching as many as 100 soldiers per day. Ukrainian forces are also burning through their equipment and ammunition faster than the West can provide and train them on new, NATO-standard weapons systems. A US military official and a source familiar with Western intelligence agreed it was unlikely that Ukraine would be able to mass the force necessary to reclaim all of the territory lost to Russia during the fighting -- especially this year, as Zelensky said on Monday was his goal. A substantial counteroffensive might be possible with more weapons and training, the sources said, but Russia may also have an opportunity to replenish its force in that time, so there are no guarantees. ""Much hinges on whether Ukraine can retake territory at least to February 23 lines,"" said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at the Center for Naval Analyses. ""The prospect is there, but it's contingent. If Ukraine can get that far, then it can likely take the rest. But if it can't, then it may have to reconsider how best to attain victory."" Russian forces gaining ground Russian forces now control more than half of the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk region military administration, said Thursday. Ukrainian forces retreated from the key eastern city of Severodonetsk on Friday after weeks of bloody battle. Russian forces last week also captured ground around Lysychansk, the last city in the eastern Luhansk region still controlled by Ukraine. Ukrainian military commanders are now grappling with the reality that they may have to withdraw from the area to defend territory further west. In the meantime, Russian oil revenues have only been going up as oil prices have skyrocketed, even amid the harsh sanctions imposed by the West. US officials said on Monday that the US and its allies are going to try capping the price of oil so Russia does not profit from it anymore, but how and when that cap will take effect remains to be seen. Internally, there is a sense among some in the Biden administration that Zelensky will need to start moderating expectations for what Ukrainian forces can realistically achieve. Zelensky said late last month that he would ""consider it a victory for our state, as of today, to advance to the February 24 line without unnecessary losses."" He reiterated that goal last week. ""We don't have any other choice left but to move forward -- move to liberate all of our territories,"" he said in a Telegram post. ""We need to kick the invaders out of the Ukrainian regions. Though the width of the frontlines is as long as over 2,5000 km, we feel that we hold the strategic initiative."" And on Monday, he put a timeline on it: He wants the war over, and for Ukraine to win, by the end of 2022, he told G7 leaders. Russia is suffering acute combat losses as well, losing as much as a third of its ground force in four months of war, US intelligence officials estimate. Officials have also said publicly that Russia will struggle to make any serious gains further west, using the Donbas region as a staging ground, without a full mobilization of its reserve forces. But Russia believes it can maintain the fight, wearing down Ukrainian and western resolve as the global economic effects of the war become more severe, officials have told CNN. The hunt for Soviet-era weaponry As CNN has previously reported, Russia is looking in particular to exploit the gap between how much Soviet-style ammunition Ukraine and its allies have in their stockpiles, and how long it will take the west to provide Ukraine with modern, NATO-standard weapons and munitions that require time-consuming training. A senior defense official acknowledged to CNN that the Soviet-era stocks are ""dwindling,"" but haven't yet reached ""rock bottom."" The official said that some eastern European countries still have more they could provide -- but only if they continue to be backfilled by allies with more modern equipment. The US and its allies, meanwhile, have been scrounging the world for the kind of Soviet-era ammunition that fits the equipment Ukraine already has, including 152 mm artillery ammunition. NATO-standard weapons fire larger, 155mm rounds. But another US defense official told CNN that effort is effectively reaching its end, with almost everything available that countries are willing to provide having already gone in. Given the prodigious rate at which the Ukrainians have gone through their older ammunition in the bruising artillery fight in the Donbas, the official said, ""Soviet-era weapons are being wiped off the earth.""",14,2.496084346304727,4.737999610069198,-2.2419152637644713,21
2022-06-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/politics/lithuania-cyber-attack-pro-russian-group/index.html,"Pro-Russia hackers claim responsibility for 'intense, ongoing' cyberattack against Lithuanian websites","An ""intense, ongoing"" cyberattack has hit the websites of government agencies and private firms in Lithuania, the Baltic country's defense ministry said Monday. A Russian-speaking hacking group, known as Killnet, claimed responsibility for at least some of the hacks, saying they were in retaliation for Lithuania blocking the shipment of some goods to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, which is wedged between Lithuania and Poland. Monday's cyberattacks were aimed in part at Lithuania's Secure Data Transfer Network, a communications network for government officials that is built to withstand war and other crises, according to the defense ministry. ""Part of the Secure National Data Transfer Network users have been unable to access services, work is in progress to restore it to normal,"" Lithuania's National Cyber Security Centre (NKSC) said in a statement issued by the defense ministry. ""It is highly probable that such, or even more, intense attacks will continue into the coming days, especially against the communications, energy and financial sectors,"" acting NKSC Director Jonas Skardinskas said in a statement. The type of hack in question is known as a distributed denial of service attack, which floods websites with phony traffic to knock them offline. It's a common tool favored by ""hacktivists"" like Killnet -- suspected non-state actors who conduct cyberattacks for political causes. Since Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February, a bevy of pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian hacking groups have caused disruptions to an array of organizations in Ukraine and Russia. A group known as the Belarusian Cyber-Partisans, for example, has claimed hacks on the IT systems that support trains moving Russian soldiers near the front lines in Ukraine. Lithuania is a member of NATO, the 30-country alliance that includes the US, which has been on guard for pro-Russian hacks for months. CNN has requested comment from NATO on Monday's hacking incidents.",3,7.195593854460388,6.80086764586225,0.39472620859813823,23
2022-06-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/europe/kremenchuk-shopping-mall-airstrike-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Russian airstrike hits busy shopping mall in central Ukraine, sparking fears of mass casualties","A Russian airstrike struck a bustling shopping mall in Kremenchuk, central Ukraine on Monday, setting the building ablaze and prompting a search and rescue operation that continued overnight. At least 18 people were killed, Dmytro Lunin, the head of the Poltava region military administration, said on Tuesday. He had earlier said the death toll could rise. ""Another 36 people are missing,"" he said, adding that more than 1,000 people -- including rescuers, police, medics and volunteers -- worked through the night. ""We continue the search."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said after the strike that up to 1,000 people were in the mall before the air raid was announced. ""Fortunately, as far as we know, at that time, many people managed to get out, they managed to get out, but there were still people inside -- workers and some visitors,"" he said. At least 58 people were injured, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Services, while Lunin said 25 people were admitted to intensive care at the hospital in Kremenchuk. Video from the scene showed heavy smoke billowing from the building, which was engulfed by fire. The mall measures about one hectare -- roughly the size of two football fields -- and the strike occurred around 4 p.m. local time, according to Volodymyr Solohub, a regional official in the Poltava Oblast local administration. ""We don't know how many more people might be under the rubble,"" Solohub said. Zelensky called the strike ""one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history,"" in his evening video address. ""A peaceful city, an ordinary shopping mall with women inside, children, ordinary civilians inside,"" he said. ""Only totally insane terrorists, who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object. And this is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike -- exactly at this shopping mall."" The attack targeted a site in central Ukraine far away from the epicenter of Russia's war, which has recently been focused in the east of the country. Ukrainian officials said the attack was conducted by a Russian KH-22 missile, which is capable of carrying an explosive warhead of up to 1 ton (2,240 pounds). It came as G7 leaders met at a summit in Germany that was mostly geared toward coordinating the Western response to Russia's invasion. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said from that meeting that the attack showed the ""depths of cruelty and barbarism"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the UK's PA news agency reported. ""This appalling attack has shown once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink,"" Johnson said, according to PA. In a tweet Monday, US President Joe Biden condemned the attack, saying, ""Russia's attack on civilians at a shopping mall is cruel. We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people."" ""As demonstrated at the G7 Summit, the U.S. along with our allies and partners will continue to hold Russia accountable for such atrocities and support Ukraine's defense,"" Biden added. French President Emmanuel Macron called the attack an ""abomination,"" in a tweet that included video of the burning shopping mall. ""The Russian people have to see the truth,"" he said. And Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmitro Kuleba, said on Twitter: ""Russia is a disgrace to humanity and it must face consequences. The response should be more heavy arms for Ukraine, more sanctions on Russia, and more businesses leaving Russia."" Those issues were on the table at the summit in Germany. The G7 vowed to continue providing support for Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"" in a joint statement, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told CNN on Monday that she would not ""bet on Russia"" winning the war. The US plans to announce as early as this week that it has bought an advanced, medium-to-long-range surface-to-air missile defense system for Ukraine, a source familiar with the announcement told CNN. However despite the outward confidence of Western leaders, Russia has seen military successes in eastern Ukraine in recent days. Russian forces captured the city of Severodonetsk after weeks of fighting and have also picked up territory south of Lysychansk. They have eliminated most Ukrainian defenses in the Luhansk region and consolidated control of a belt of territory in the south, bringing strategic benefits and blunting the effectiveness of Ukrainian counterattacks. Russian forces have also stepped up attacks in the Donetsk region, getting slightly closer to the belt of industrial towns in the region that runs south from Sloviansk through Kramatorsk to Kostiantynivka. ""Zelensky was very much focused on trying to ensure that Ukraine is in as advantageous a position on the battlefield as possible in the next months as opposed to the next years, because he believes that a grinding conflict is not in the interest of the Ukrainian people,"" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said after the Ukrainian President met virtually with leaders at the G7. Earlier, a source familiar with the matter told CNN that Zelensky told leaders he wanted the war to be over by the end of the year, before winter sets in.",17,4.434690641938113,3.1982127334605046,1.2364779084776085,7
2022-06-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/europe/russia-ukraine-war-tide-turning-lister-intl-hnk/index.html,Tide turns in the Ukraine war as Russia makes progress in the east,"Russian forces are arguably having their best spell since the invasion of Ukraine began four months ago. They have eliminated most Ukrainian defenses in the Luhansk region, consolidated control of a belt of territory in the south, improved their logistics and command structure and blunted the effectiveness of Ukrainian attack drones. Within the last week, the Russians have been rewarded for their intense -- some would say merciless -- bombardments of the remaining parts of the Luhansk region held by Ukrainian forces, which have finally given up Severodonetsk and lost territory south of Lysychansk. The head of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic, Leonid Pasechnik, predicted last Friday that Russian forces would completely encircle Lysychansk within two or three days. So far they haven't, but the city is in imminent peril. Russian forces have also stepped up attacks in the Donetsk region, getting slightly closer to the belt of industrial towns in the region that runs south from Sloviansk through Kramatorsk to Kostiantynivka. In Lysychansk and many of the towns studded across the meandering front lines that pass through five regions, the Ukrainians may well face a repeat of what happened in Severodonetsk, where they were bombarded into withdrawing. There was simply nothing left that could be defended. The immediate dilemma for the Ukrainian military is whether it remains committed to defending Lysychansk, with the risk of losing troops and weapons if the city is encircled -- and whether Ukraine's political leadership will order a withdrawal to new defensive lines. If so, can the units now in the pocket of territory held by Ukraine retreat without being decimated? Large sections of the highway from Lysychansk to Bakhmut are littered with wreckage, and Russian units are edging closer to Bakhmut itself. It appears the Russians are not currently making much progress from Izium in the north towards Sloviansk, despite repeated attempts to break through Ukrainian lines. Even so, Ukrainian officials cautioned Sunday that Russian forces were ""accumulating"" north of Sloviansk. The Russian military can quickly mobilize a handful of battalion tactical groups sitting across the border. Some Russian military bloggers are not getting carried away with optimism. Yuri Kotyenok, for one, believes that Russian forces do not have enough manpower to encircle the heavily fortified cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. In the longer run, the Ukrainians' best hope is that as they deploy more Western weaponry capable of destroying Russian artillery, rocket systems and command posts far behind the front lines, they can gradually reduce the deficit in firepower. But weapons such as the HIMARS rocket system, which has a range of 70 kilometers (43 miles) in the configuration supplied to Ukraine, require several weeks of training. And in Donbas, several weeks is a long time given the current pressure on Ukrainian forces. That pressure is all the greater because many of the units deployed to the region are among the most experienced that Ukraine has. They have been worn down by the sheer intensity of Russian bombardment and are not easily replaced. And the Ukrainian military has already lost in combat some of the weapons rushed to the front. Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed last week that Russian strikes had already eliminated some of the US-supplied M777 howitzers. The Russian offensive has also learned from mistakes made during the initial and abortive drive towards Kyiv. Air defenses, principally the S-300, have been deployed to provide extensive rather than local cover, making Ukrainian attack drones less effective. Anecdotally, it seems fewer videos have been posted recently on social media showing Ukrainian combat planes in action. Russia appoints new commanders The Russian hierarchy has also been reorganized, with new commanders for the southern and central forces committed to Ukraine under the overall leadership of Deputy Defense Minister Gennady Zhidko. The Institute for the Study of War said the ""Russian high command is reshuffling and restructuring military command in order to better organize operations in Ukraine."" It's perhaps no accident that the first reported visit of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and senior commanders to forces involved in the ""special military operation"" came as the tide seemed to flow in Russia's favor. Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan. Rob Lee, an analyst of the Russian military at King's College London, noted that Zhidko sat next to Shoigu at meetings during his visit. Lee recalled that Russia apparently ""had no overall commander in the initial phase (in March), violating the unity of command principle."" The great unknown is whether Russian success in rolling up Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk might encourage a further expansion of its war aims beyond the special military operation -- perhaps an effort to sustain the momentum as far as the Dnipro river, which essentially divides Ukraine into two. That is the worst-case scenario for the Ukrainians and for now it remains a distant possibility rather than an imminent risk. Ukrainian forces are still defending some 12,000 square kilometers (4,600 square miles) of Donetsk alone (an area the size of Connecticut.) Despite Ukrainian reverses in recent weeks, there is still plenty of evidence that Russian armor is also suffering a high rate of attrition. Western officials believe some battalion tactical groups have been reconstituted. And there may be a silver lining for Ukraine in its battlefield reverses: they make the case for an accelerated weapons pipeline from the West just as the G7 leaders meet. One of President Zelensky's most committed backers, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, is aware of the risk of ""Ukraine fatigue"" as the battlefield appears to turn in Russia's favor. ""The first few weeks and months of the Ukrainian resistance have been characterized by overwhelming global unity and a huge surge of support for the Ukrainian people,"" he said as the G7 got underway in Germany. ""It is essential that this is sustained for the long term. Russia's behavior and the atrocities Putin is committing must not become normalized in the eyes of the world."" US President Joe Biden issued a similar appeal. ""We have to stay together. Putin has been counting on from the beginning that somehow NATO and the G7 would splinter, but we haven't and we're not going to,"" he said. There is -- for now -- no sign that either side is going to blink, not least because so much is at stake. Hal Brands, writing in Foreign Affairs, said the conflict ""has both highlighted and deepened the fundamental global cleavage today -- the clash between advanced democracies that are committed to the existing international order and the Eurasian autocracies trying to overturn it."" But for Putin, this war of choice is an installment (a big one) of an existential struggle against US hegemony. The Institute for the Study of War concluded that the Kremlin ""intends to conduct a protracted conflict in Ukraine and is seeking to advance mobilization efforts to support long-term military and political goals in occupied areas of Ukraine.""",14,2.3260010692175586,6.241190312069566,-3.9151892428520076,21
2022-06-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/politics/nato-turkey-finland-sweden/index.html,US and European officials eye summit for progress for Finland and Sweden joining NATO,"European and US officials do not expect that Turkey's concerns about Finland and Sweden joining NATO will be assuaged before the alliance's summit this week, US and European officials told CNN. Yet some officials believe that Turkey may be eying the summit as a place to finally make agreements that could propel the process forward. ""My best projection based on what I've seen is that they will run this to the wire at Madrid. They also always prefer if they're going to make concessions to do it at the leader level, they believe that enhances that status,"" said one European official when discussing the matter. ""It is Turkey's standard operating procedure not to give concessions till the last possible moment. And that last possible moment is usually defined as a bilateral with the US president, followed by a leaders meeting."" But Turkish officials have said that they do not see any ""limited timetable"" to the talks, and some US and European are less convinced that Turkey is ready to strike an agreement in Spain. White House officials have been circumspect about whether US President Joe Biden and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will meet in Spain. But one person familiar with the matter said they expected the men to speak at some point about the accession process, though it may not be elevated into a formal bilateral meeting. Speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in Germany, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the goal ahead of the Madrid summit was to ""create as much positive momentum as we can behind the candidacies of Finland and Sweden,"" though he cautioned, ""I am not sitting here today suggesting that all issues will be resolved by Madrid."" He said no formal bilateral meeting was scheduled between Biden and Erdoğan, but that they ""may very well have the opportunity to see one another."" ""Let's see how the next 24 hours unfold. There is a flurry of diplomatic activity occurring today,"" he said. Biden, he said, was following the developments ""very closely."" ""His team is working it with the Finns, Swedes and Turks, and I'm on the phone daily with my counterparts,"" he said. ""So, let's see how things go."" US officials have been wary about inserting Biden directly into the discussions, aware that having the US so closely involved could raise the stakes and escalate Erdoğan's demand -- including the likely extradition request for a US-based cleric Erdoğan accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. Still, US officials are still confident the applications from Finland and Sweden will eventually be successful. Erdoğan has accused the two countries of harboring members of the separatist militant Kurdistan's Workers Party, also known as PKK, which Turkey views as a terrorist organization. Turkey also wants the countries to get rid of an embargo on arms sales to Turkey that was put into place after Turkey's military intervention in northern Syria in 2019. As talks have lasted for over a month, US and European officials are growing quietly frustrated with how Turkey has drawn out what they initially hoped would be a quick entry to the defensive alliance for the two countries. Some officials are now concerned that Turkey may want more in terms of concessions than it is publicly stating. ""There is concern over the delay, and what else Turkey may begin to push for as they recognize the leverage that they have right now,"" said a second European official. A lack of progress on the two countries joining late would put a damper on the high-profile gathering where leaders are looking for ways to bolster the defensive military alliance. In recent weeks, officials had stated a desire to have the challenge in the rear-view mirror by the time of the meeting in Spain. At one point, officials privately said they hoped the Madrid summit would act as a welcoming party for the alliance's two newest members. It would have sent a clear message to Russia about NATO's growing capabilities. ""My intention is to have this in place before the NATO summit,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said of the process to get Finland and Sweden to join NATO, as he stood next to Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier this month. ""At the same time, I know that to make progress we need 30 Allies to agree."" Last week Turkey met with officials from both countries and NATO, but there was no breakthrough after the meeting. And meanwhile, with the ongoing war in Ukraine, Turkey has also been involved in some direct talks with Russia -- which ardently opposes NATO expansion -- about the need to get Ukrainian grain out of the country.",29,5.206568382798981,3.1548867111296377,2.051681671669343,2

One person died and at least six were wounded in a Russian missile strike that hit a residential apartment block in Kyiv. The city's Deputy Mayor, Volodymyr Bondarenko, said four of the injured were admitted to the hospital as search and rescue operations continue. Bondarenko also said a kindergarten was hit in the missile strike but no one was injured, and video from Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs showed a large missile funnel in the backyard of the kindergarten. Those injured in the residential block included a 7-year-old girl, he said. Her mother, a 35-year-old woman named Katerina, was rescued from the rubble and put into an ambulance. She is a citizen of Russia, but had lived in Kyiv for a long time. A CNN team on the ground spoke to the injured girl's grandmother, Natalia Nikitina, who found out about the attack online and rushed to the apartment block, where she cried as she watched teams trying to rescue her daughter-in-law. ""There is nothing worse than losing loved ones. Why do we deserve this?"" she said. A huge plume of smoke continued to billow from the building two hours after the strike, while nearly every window was blown out on the top floor, and the ground was covered in debris and twisted metal. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat said ""strategic bombers"" were used to hit the capital, with ""four to six missiles"" launched. He added that on Saturday, Russia had used Tu22M3 long-range bombers from the airspace of Belarus for the first time in a Ukrainian air strike. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram there had been several explosions in the city's Shevchenkivskyi district, and that search and rescue operations were launched after a fire broke out when a residential building was hit by a rocket. ""There are people are trapped under the rubble. Some residents have been evacuated, with two victims hospitalized. Rescuers are continuing their work,"" he said. Speaking to CNN onsite, Klitschko said Russia's war on Ukraine was ""senseless"" and thousands of civilians had died, and added, ""We have to do everything to stop this war."" The Ukrainian State Emergency Service said the fire was caused by ""enemy shelling"" and was over an area of 300 square meters, in ""a 9-storey residential building with partial destruction of the 7th, 9th and 9th floors."" The same neighborhood was hit by a missile strike in early May, and was also targeted in March. Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs, said on Ukrainian television that there are ""a number of military infrastructure facilities located in the Shevchenkivskyi district of the Ukrainian capital. This is the reason why the Russians are shelling this district."" US President Joe Biden called Sunday's attack ""more of [Russian] barbarism."" He declined to respond when asked whether the strikes were a deliberate provocation during the G7 summit. Russian offensive continues in eastern Ukraine After the key city of Severodonetsk was confirmed by Ukraine to be ""completely under Russian occupation"" on Saturday, the country's eastern Luhansk region is now almost entirely under Russian control. However, Ukrainian forces continue to defend the neighboring city of Lysychansk, which is coming under growing Russian artillery and rocket attacks. On Sunday, the head of the neighboring Donetsk region's military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Russian forces were gathering for fresh assaults in the region, nearly half of which is under Ukrainian control. ""We are now witnessing the accumulation of manpower, heavy armored vehicles and artillery in the direction of Sloviansk,"" Kyrylenko said on Ukrainian television. ""The enemy is using its well-known tactics, trying to move closer to our line of defense in order to fire artillery at the cities. Enemy artillery is already reaching certain parts of Sloviansk. This is another confirmation that people should evacuate."" Throughout the offensive in the east, Russian forces have used intense artillery and rocket bombardment ahead of trying to take ground. They are attacking areas of Donetsk from three directions. Kyrylenko said there had been a missile strike and rocket attacks on Kurakhove, a town on the southern front line in Donetsk that has been a target of Russian attacks for more than two months. Avdiivka had also been hit by rockets, he said. As Russian forces step up the momentum of their offensive in eastern Ukraine, the city of Kharkiv and surrounding areas have come under increasing artillery fire again. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu also visited Russian troops involved in what the Kremlin has called the special military operation in Ukraine, according to the Defense Ministry. Video released by the news agency RIA Novosti shows Shoigu disembarking from a helicopter in an unknown location and meeting officers inside what appears to be a command center. The Telegram channel of the Russian Defense Ministry said Shoigu ""listened to reports from commanders on the current situation and the actions of the Russian Armed Forces in the main operational areas at command posts."" Shoigu is also seen conferring medals on several soldiers, including ""the Gold Star Medals of the Hero of the Russian Federation and the Order of Courage,"" according to the Telegram post. It's unclear exactly which locations Shoigu visited and whether they were inside Ukraine. Putin says Russia will supply nuclear-capable missiles to Belarus Russia will transfer nuclear-capable Iskander-M missile systems to Belarus over the coming months, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko at a meeting in St. Petersburg on Saturday. ""In the next few months, we will transfer to Belarus the Iskander-M tactical missile systems, which, as you know, can use both ballistic and cruise missiles, both in conventional and nuclear versions,"" Putin told Lukashenko, according to the Kremlin. In a transcript of the meeting, Lukashenko expressed to Putin his ""stress"" and concerns and over what he alleged are flights by United States and NATO planes ""training to carry nuclear warheads"" close to Belarus' border. Lukashenko asked Putin to consider ""a mirrored response"" to the flights or to convert Russia's Su-35 fighter jets, that are currently deployed to Belarus, so that ""they can carry nuclear warheads."" Putin replied that although it is possible to match the US flights, ""there is no need,"" and suggested that because Belarus' military has a large number of Su-25 aircraft that can be converted to nuclear-capable instead. The Iskander-M is a Russian built short range ballistic missile system that can carry conventional or nuclear warheads with a maximum range of up to 500 KM (310 miles),according to Janes Defense. On Saturday, Ukraine said it had been hit by attacks launched from the Belarusian airspace for the first time. G7 announces ban on import of Russian gold President Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson formally announced Sunday that the G7 countries will ban the import of Russian gold, the country's second-largest export after energy. Biden tweeted on the announcement Sunday in Germany, ""The United States has imposed unprecedented costs on Putin to deny him the revenue he needs to fund his war against Ukraine. Together, the G7 will announce that we will ban the import of Russian gold, a major export that rakes in tens of billions of dollars for Russia."" Biden also remarked on the unity of the G7 and NATO on Ukraine and the Russian invasion, telling German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that the G7 and NATO will stay together and not ""splinter."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the price of allowing Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""continue with his program of conquest"" is far higher than the current cost. ""The price of backing down, the price of allowing Putin to succeed, to hack off huge parts of Ukraine, to continue with his program of conquest, that price will be far, far higher.

""The [Russians] appointed a commandant. But the city is so destroyed that it will be difficult for people to cope with this situation,"" said military administration chief Oleksandr Striuk. Regional military officials said Friday that the last troops in Severodonetsk had been ordered to leave, as it was impossible to keep defending their positions. This effectively ceded the city to Russia and put the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk almost fully under Russian control. Severodonetsk was one of the last major Ukrainian strongholds in the area. Serhiy Hayday, a top military commander in east Ukraine, said the military made the decision to evacuate ""because the number of dead in unfortified territories may grow every day."" Russia's Ministry of Defense (MOD) on Saturday confirmed its forces have taken control of the entire left bank of the Siverskyi Donets, the eastern side of the river, and all the borders of pro-Russian breakaway Luhansk People's Republic. Russian forces ""as a result of successful offensive actions, completely liberated the cities of Severodonetsk and Borivske, the settlements of Voronove and Syrotyne of the Luhansk People's Republic,"" MOD spokesperson Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said in a statement. ""Currently, there is no possibility to leave the city, people can try to leave only in the direction of the occupied territory. We will facilitate the evacuation, but so far there is no such opportunity,"" Striuk said. Several hundred civilians had taken shelter at the Azot chemical plant and rejected pleas to leave. Earlier on Saturday, Hayday said Russian forces were still shelling the plant. ""Civilians are leaving the territory of the Azot plant, they [the Russians] shoot propaganda videos with them. People spent almost 3 months in basements, shelters. At the moment, they need physical and psychological help,"" Striuk added. Konashenkov said in the statement ""the territory of the Azot plant in Severodonetsk is controlled by the LPR forces"" and the attempt of Ukrainian forces to ""turn the industrial zone of the Azot plant into a hotbed of resistance has been thwarted."" Avalanche of missile strikes Ukraine has been hit by an avalanche of missile strikes, with official accounts there estimating that Russia fired more than 40 missiles at targets in Ukraine in the past 24 hours. The General Staff of the Ukrainian military said there was more shelling around Kharkiv, and the Russians had tried to launch an assault near the settlement of Uda, north of Kharkiv, but ""were decisively suppressed by our soldiers."" North of Sloviansk, the Ukrainian military reported continuing battles in areas that have been on the front lines for months. The Russians used artillery and air strikes against Ukrainian positions some 20 kilometers north of the city. On the southern front, the Ukrainian military reported that a Russian assault to recover previously lost ground in Kherson had been repulsed. Ukrainian forces have been pushing into Kherson, with limited success, from Mykolaiv region. The mayor of the city of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Sienkevyck, reported explosions there overnight. On Friday, he urged ""everyone who wants to stay alive to leave the city,"" and said it was being ""shelled every day,"" with 111 people killed so far. Explosions were also reported by the regional military administration in Zhytomyr in central Ukraine, killing one soldier and wounding another, although the city's mayor said Zhytomyr itself was ""not hit."" The head of the military administration said ""about 10 missiles"" had been shot down by Ukrainian defenders. Regional authorities in Lviv in western Ukraine also reported missile strikes against military facilities. Offensive continues in eastern Ukraine Two US officials with direct knowledge of US intelligence assessments told CNN Russian forces were gaining an advantage in eastern Ukraine as they learned from mistakes made during the earlier stages of their invasion of the country, including better coordination of air and ground attacks as well as improvements to logistics and supply lines. Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops in the eastern city of Lysychansk are under growing pressure from Russian forces that have taken territory to the south of the city. Hayday said Russian forces tried to enter Lysychansk from the south and to surround the city -- and had also carried out an airstrike on the city. The Ukrainian military's General Staff said Saturday that Russian efforts to cut off the main route from Bakhmut to Lysychansk continued. It said Ukrainian soldiers had stopped the advance of Russian infantry near Volodymyrivka, which is 5 kilometers from the highway. But the General Staff acknowledged the Russians had advanced 1 kilometer as they close in on Bakhmut. The Russian goal appears to be to cut off Ukrainian forces in a pocket of Luhansk and Donetsk regions. If they capture Bakhmut they would be able to prevent most resupply efforts to Ukrainian defenders in Lysychansk and surrounding districts. Ukraine claims attacks launched from Belarus airspace As Ukrainian authorities assessed the damage from dozens of missile strikes overnight, the Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate said that many of the missiles were fired from Belarusian airspace. The Directorate said that ""missile strikes from the territory of Belarus are a large-scale provocation of the Russian Federation in order to further involve Belarus in the war against Ukraine."" It said '""Russian bombers hit directly from the territory of Belarus. Six Tu-22M3 aircraft were involved, which launched 12 Kh-22 cruise missiles."" The Directorate said the missiles had been launched from airspace above the district of Petrikov in southern Belarus. ""After launching the missiles, they returned to Shaikovka airfield in Russia. The strike was launched on Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions."" ""This is the first case of an air strike on Ukraine directly from the territory of Belarus,"" the Directorate said. CNN cannot confirm that allegation. Ukraine's air force command has echoed the Defense Ministry's comments, saying on its Facebook page that ""more than fifty missiles of various types were fired: air, sea and ground-based."" There has been no word from the Belarus government on the alleged use of its airspace for the latest strikes against Ukraine. Ukraine denies Russian claim of attack on Polish 'mercenaries' A Russian missile hit the town of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Saturday, according to both local authorities and the Russian Ministry of Defense. But the two sides' versions of what was targeted differ. Oleksii Roslov, head of Kostiantynivka civil military administration, said an ""object of critical infrastructure was hit,"" affecting gas supply and killing one person. The Russian Ministry of Defense published a short video of the missile attack, saying it targeted Polish mercenaries based at the Megatex plant in Kostiantynivka and had killed up to 80 of them, as well as rocket launchers. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, said: ""The enemy continues to suffer significant losses. Up to 80 Polish mercenaries, 20 armored combat vehicles and eight Grad multiple launch rocket systems were destroyed as a result of strikes with high-precision weapons of the Russian Aerospace Forces on the buildings of the Megatex zinc plant."" Roslov denied the claim. ""There weren't any military there. Many people were there after the strike, everyone can confirm there were no military,"" Roslov told CNN. Around 45,000 people remain in the town, which is some distance from the front lines.",14,1.441347739705192,1.524338914567061,-0.08299117486186902,29
2022-06-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/europe/severodonetsk-luhansk-russia-ukraine-intl/index.html,Ukraine to withdraw from key city of Severodonetsk as Russia's advance grinds on,"Ukrainian forces are withdrawing from Severodonetsk, effectively ceding the city to Russia and putting the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk almost fully under Russian control following months of grueling and bloody fighting Severodonetsk was one of the last major Ukrainian strongholds in the area. Serhiy Hayday, a top military commander in east Ukraine, said the military made the decision to evacuate ""because the number of dead in unfortified territories may grow every day."" ""It makes no sense to stay,"" Hayday said. It's unclear if Ukrainian forces are currently leaving the city, or if they have already evacuated. Though the capture is a symbolic breakthrough for Russia, it comes after a lengthy and costly battle in which Moscow's forces were met with a stubborn Ukrainian resistance. Russian forces have diverted much of their firepower toward overrunning the city, simply destroying every defensive position the Ukrainians have adopted. The strategy played out slowly, with the Russians making labored and sluggish gains around Severodonetsk throughout the spring and early summer. Ukrainian forces were, little by little, pushed into a few square blocks around the Azot chemical plant, where some 500 civilians, including dozens of children, have taken shelter -- a scene reminiscent of the siege of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. With the military evacuating the city, however, the fate of those inside the Azot plant is unclear. Hayday, the head of the Luhansk regional military administration, has repeatedly accused Moscow of scorched-earth tactics, flattening cities with little regard for casualties as it attempts to take them. ""All the infrastructure of the city is completely destroyed,"" he said of Severodonetsk on Friday. The battle now moves across the Siverskyi Donets river to Lysychansk, the last city in Luhansk held by Ukrainian forces. And there are already signs that the Russians will use the same merciless tactic of aerial bombardment to grind down Ukrainian forces, deploying combat planes, multiple launch rocket systems and even short-range ballistic missiles. Ukraine's control over Lysychansk has become more tenuous in recent days. Russian forces have advanced into several villages south of the city, though not without sustaining losses from Ukrainian artillery fire. The Ukrainian military claims that some Russian battalion tactical groups are being consolidated or withdrawn to restore their combat capabilities. The Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank that follows the campaign closely, said the Russian breakthrough from the south means they ""may be able to threaten Lysychansk in the coming days while avoiding a difficult opposed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets River."" A win for Putin, but at what cost? Luhansk and neighboring Donetsk together make up Ukraine's Donbas region, an industrial heartland dotted with factories and coal fields that has been home to sporadic fighting since 2014, when Russian-backed separatists seized control of two territories -- the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The Kremlin has been quietly supporting troops there since 2014, and even began granting passports to residents in 2018, with more than half a million distributed by mid-2021, according to Russian state media. Shortly before invading Ukraine in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the two separatist territories as independent states, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in defiance of international law. The capture of Severodonetsk gives Putin an important propaganda victory in a war which, so far, has been mostly marked by Moscow's military setbacks. A key goal of Russia's so-called ""special military operation"" -- the Kremlin's official euphemism for the invasion of Ukraine -- was to take control of Donbas. Experts expected a quick fight in the region, unlike the battles around Kyiv in the initial days of the war that Russia lost. The fighting near the Ukrainian capital was mostly urban warfare, which allowed Ukraine's military to stymie Russia's advantages in manpower and hardware by keeping the battles in tighter corridors, where Ukraine's highly motivated fighting force could capitalize on its better knowledge of the local environment. Donbas, however, is a region of plains and open spaces. The battles there have involved long-range weaponry, a type of warfare that favors Russia and its superior power and larger armed forces. After little success in the first month of the conflict, Russian forces retreated from around Kyiv, regrouped and concentrated on eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin's new offensive to take the Donbas region was launched April 18, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia's progress was, initially, ""slow and uneven,"" according to US officials, as its army appeared to still be learning from its mistakes in the initial days of the invasion. The tide began turning in mid-May, when Mariupol, a strategically important port city, finally completely fell to Russian forces following an intense, three-month long bombing campaign that Ukrainian officials say left as many as 22,000 people dead. The fight there was markedly similar to the battle for Severdonetsk, both in terms of Russia's tactical decisions and with Ukrainian fighters and civilians holing up in structures that, before the war, were used for heavy industry. Russian then increased the intensity of their bombardment in other parts of the Donbas region, a strategy Zelensky likened to genocide. Eyes shift to Donetsk Some experts have questioned whether Russia's efforts to take Severodonetsk were strategically worth it. ""The loss of Severodonetsk is a loss for Ukraine in the sense that any terrain captured by Russian forces is a loss -- but the battle of Severodonetsk will not be a decisive Russian victory,"" said the Institute for War. ""Ukrainian troops have succeeded for weeks in drawing substantial quantities of Russian personnel, weapons, and equipment into the area and have likely degraded Russian forces' overall capabilities while preventing Russian forces from focusing on more advantageous axes of advance."" If Russian forces capture Lysychansk, and with it the Luhansk region, they will likely concentrate more troops on Donetsk, where progress has come much more slowly. Ukraine's regional military administration says about 45% of Donetsk is held by Ukrainian forces, including the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. It's unclear whether the losses inflicted on Russian forces in recent weeks will impair their ability and desire to gobble up more territory, but the Kremlin has not veered from its ultimate objective of taking those two cities. Equally, it remains to be seen whether the punishment endured by Ukrainian units has left them with enough resources to launch counterattacks against the Russians. Ukrainian officials have made repeated calls for more military assistance from its allies. Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said on June 14 that the country had received just 10% of military assistance it had requested. ""No matter how professional our army is, without the assistance of our Western partners Ukraine will not be able to win this war,"" said Maliar. Ukrainian commanders will now have to decide whether it is strategically worthwhile to keep defending Lysychansk, as Kyiv could abandon the city and divert resources for a more consolidated defense of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka, the industrial belt of Donetsk. The Kremlin has not veered from its ultimate objective of taking all of Donetsk and Luhansk. It now has almost all of the latter. But completing the so-called ""special military operation"" will likely take many more months, setting up a war of attrition.",14,1.2917985858711465,6.542862222194479,-5.251063636323333,21
2022-06-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/russian-spy-johns-hopkins-classmates-accent-suspicious/index.html,"Suspected Russian spy was well-liked by classmates, but something just seemed a little off","Victor Muller's accent just didn't sound right. The man now alleged to be a Russian spy was studying at the prestigious Johns Hopkins' School of Advanced International Studies, an elite graduate program favored by US military personnel, young diplomats and, sources say, future spies. Gregarious, smart, and often seen toting a helmet for his beloved motorcycle, ""Muller"" was known, and even liked, by his fellow students and the faculty at SAIS. But his muddled accent caught the ear of a few classmates. On one occasion, a fellow student asked him outright: Are you Russian? The spy brushed off the question. He was from Brazil, he said in what turned out to be part of the elaborate cover identity he spent years building. ""Looking back, it was a red flag,"" the former classmate told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""I remember thinking at the time it didn't really make sense."" ""Muller"" graduated from SAIS in 2020. Last week, a Dutch intelligence agency publicly identified him as Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, a Russian military intelligence officer who in April traveled to the Netherlands to start an internship at the International Criminal Court (ICC). From there, he would have had a perch to spy on war crimes investigations into Russian military actions in Ukraine and elsewhere, sources say. Dutch officials stopped him at the border and sent him back to Brazil, where he had been living under the forged identity of a Brazilian man whose parents are deceased, according to Brazilian police. It was not immediately clear when the US became aware of Cherkasov's true identity. The FBI has an active investigation open, according to one source familiar with the intelligence. US and Dutch intelligence agencies shared information about Cherkasov some time ago, according to a separate US official, though it's not clear when that occurred. Yet another US official wouldn't address how the Russian intelligence connection came to light, adding that the FBI worked closely with the Dutch authorities on tracking his activities. The revelation of Cherkasov's true identity has roiled faculty at SAIS. But to former intelligence officials, Cherkasov fits a well-known pattern: Russia, among other foreign powers, seeks to place young intelligence operatives in American academic institutions to help build their deep cover identities. Often, the mission of so-called ""illegals"" -- a spy operating under an identity not linked to the Russian government in any way -- is to do little more than simply establish legitimacy as a student, said John McLaughlin, a former deputy director of the CIA who now teaches at SAIS. ""It's not unusual,"" McLaughlin said. ""My sense is that passing through SAIS was a kind of laundering experience for him. These Russian illegals tend to go through a long process of credentialing themselves in order to establish credibility as who they claim to be."" SAIS declined to comment when reached by CNN on Friday. But in an email to faculty and students obtained by CNN, SAIS dean Jim Steinberg confirmed that Cherkasov graduated in 2020. ""We are continuing to monitor developments, but we have no further information to share at this time,"" Steinberg wrote. Cherkasov did not respond to a phone call or text message seeking comment on Friday. 'Teacher's favorite' Cherkasov appears to have carried out that mission quite successfully. One of Cherkasov's professors -- who taught a class on genocide -- wrote his reference letter for the internship at The Hague. In another SAIS class, ""he was the teacher's favorite,"" said another classmate, who like other former classmates spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation from the Russian security services. ""He was a very nice guy, very open-minded, very active in class."" ""This guy I would have never suspected [of being a spy],"" the former classmate told CNN. A third former classmate of Cherkasov, a US military officer, struck up a conversation one day with Muller about their shared love of motor bikes. Eventually he got the impression that he and Muller might go for a ride together, the military officer told CNN. But then, he asked Muller if he spoke Russian, since it sounded like he might based on his accent. Muller denied being able to speak Russian and became withdrawn, the military officer said. The motor bike ride never happened. Multiple former intelligence officials told CNN it would not be unusual for US counterintelligence officials to allow a Russian ""illegal"" to continue his studies in order to watch him and try to learn who his contacts are, whether he is operating in a larger network inside the United States, and how he is building his cover. It's possible the US tipped off the Dutch intelligence service, these people said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the case. But another former counterintelligence officer noted that US intelligence services sometimes aren't aware of student spies until they become more actively engaged in carrying out espionage -- and only then, do they trace their histories back to SAIS or other academic institutions in the United States with a foreign policy bent. 'Insider threat' Why the Kremlin would want to plant a spy in the International Criminal Court is clear, former intelligence officials say: It would offer Russia a crucial window into the investigation into alleged Russian war crimes -- in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine in 2022. ""For those reasons, covert access to International Criminal Court information would be highly valuable to the Russian intelligence services,"" Dutch intelligence said in its statement. Effectively planting a spy is increasingly difficult for intelligence services across the globe, thanks to ubiquitous surveillance technology and the degree to which most people live their entire lives online in 2022. An online profile that only popped up a few years ago, or a profile that suddenly goes inactive, can be a tip-off for counterintelligence officers trying to spot spies. The problem is equally difficult for American spies operating abroad under ""nonofficial cover,"" a so-called NOC. ""Any sort of durable long-term illegal is not a dying breed but far more difficult to do now than it once was,"" said one former US counterintelligence official. ""And that's true for everybody."" The US arrested and deported 10 Russian operatives as part of a spy swap with Moscow in 2010, one of whom had graduated from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government 10 years before and had been living in Cambridge with his wife and two children. Harvard subsequently stripped Andrey Bezrukov -- who went by the name Donald Heathfield -- of his degree. His wife, Elena Vavilova, graduated from McGill University and was deported as part of the same swap. Cherkasov had similarly sought to quietly build an alternate identity over the course of years. The Dutch intelligence agency published a crude ""legend"" that it says was probably written by Cherkasov in mid-2010, laying out his false history as a Brazilian man born in Rio de Janeiro in 1989. He details this fake family history through multiple generations, offering a myriad of small personal idiosyncrasies: a hatred for fish, a beloved aunt, a crush on a geography teacher. In 2014, Cherkasov began attending college at Trinity College Dublin, studying political science and graduating in 2018. The same year, he traveled to the United States to obtain his master's degree at SAIS. Unanswered questions Throughout his time as a student, Muller maintained an active digital life. In 2017, he started a blog on geopolitics, according to the open-source intelligence company Bellingcat. He maintained a Facebook and a Twitter account, full of friends from both schools and, in September 2018, published a YouTube video introducing his new motorcycle. In the video, a man whom Bellingcat identifies as Cherkasov can be heard chuckling and greeting at a trolley of tourists riding near the Potomac River. Although it's not clear how far back Russian intelligence plotted to place Cherkasov at The Hague -- some former intelligence officials said it might have been opportunistic rather than a long-running plan -- Cherkasov did take classes that made sense for a student interested in The Hague as a career path, including a class on genocide. A policy memo that Cherkasov wrote for one of his SAIS classes exhibits the sober and anecdote-rich analysis one might expect from a student of international affairs. The memo, obtained by CNN, advocates potential US responses at the United Nations to help stop a genocide. It's the sort of US policy discussion that has in recent months applied to trying to curtail Russian violence in Ukraine. And according to multiple people familiar with him while at SAIS, Cherkasov was a good student -- smart, engaged and talkative in class. One class that Muller either enrolled in or audited was on strategic diplomacy, popular with US military and intelligence professionals, and taught by Steinberg, a former deputy secretary of State in the Obama administration and current dean of SAIS, according to one of the former SAIS students. SAIS faculty and students have been left stunned by the revelation that the Brazilian student with the funny accent was, in fact, a Russian spy. SAIS faculty who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity say that the school's communication to them has been bare bones, little more than an acknowledgment of the public reporting. ""It's off-putting,"" said the former SAIS student who pressed Cherkasov on his accent. ""For me, it raises a lot of questions about how he was admitted to SAIS, how he was able to travel.""",3,7.869853672468937,6.4240505622099136,1.4458031102590239,3
2022-06-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/russian-forces-advantage-eastern-ukraine-war-intelligence/index.html,"Russia is gaining advantage in eastern Ukraine as forces learn from earlier mistakes, US officials say","Russian forces are gaining an advantage in eastern Ukraine as they learn from mistakes made during the earlier stages of their invasion of the country, including better coordinating air and ground attacks and improving logistics and supply lines, two US officials with direct knowledge of US intelligence assessments told CNN. The US does not expect new weapons systems recently supplied to Ukrainian forces, including the HIMARS multiple rocket launch system, to immediately change the situation on the battlefield in part because those systems are so far being sent with both a limited range and a limited number of rockets to ensure they are not fired into Russian territory. Additionally, Russian forces have been able to destroy some of the new Western-supplied weapons, including M777 howitzers, in targeted attacks. The US assessments, which increasingly envision a long and punishing battle in eastern Ukraine, come as the months-long war there has reached a pivotal moment in recent days. Ukraine's military has been burning through Soviet-era ammunition that fits older systems, and Western governments are facing a tough decision on whether they want to continue increasing their assistance to the country. The US assessments paint a dismal image of the future of the war, with high personnel and equipment losses on both sides. US officials believe that Russian forces plan to maintain intense attacks in the east, characterized by heavy artillery and missile strikes, with the intention of wearing down Ukrainian forces and NATO resolve over time. Russia's advancements were brought into plain view in recent days after Ukraine's defense of Lysychansk -- the last city in the Luhansk region it still holds -- became a lot more tenuous. In the last couple of days, Russians have advanced into several villages south of Lysychansk, though not without sustaining losses from Ukrainian artillery fire. In the coming weeks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will virtually address the upcoming G7 and NATO summits, senior US administration officials have said, with the leader looking to shore up Western support for his country. During the G7, President Joe Biden will unveil steps alongside other leaders to increase pressure on Russia for its invasion. And at NATO, the US will announce measures to ""strengthen European security, alongside expected major new contributions from allies,"" one official said. Members of the Ukrainian parliament have told US lawmakers that the Russian military has calculated how much ammunition Western allies have in stockpiles for the Ukrainian military's mostly Russian-made artillery -- and plan to wait for Ukrainian forces to run out over time. ""Putin is not deterred and I don't think he will ever be deterred,"" Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN. ""This war could last years,"" he added. At home, US and NATO partners are beginning to see the limits of their own supplies of certain advanced weapons, including shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles. These weapons systems have their own complicated supply lines, meaning it could take years to replace the thousands of such missiles already supplied to Ukrainian forces. Meanwhile, the US Defense Department's watchdog has opened an evaluation of the department's plans to restock its own munitions and equipment stockpiles as it continues to supply significant quantities to Ukraine, the agency announced Wednesday. ""The objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the DOD has planned to restock its equipment and munitions provided to Ukraine,"" the department's inspector general said in a statement.",14,4.5828103247984595,4.345679113324739,0.23713121147372007,21

For weeks, Russian forces have been trying to obliterate Ukrainian defensive positions to the south and east of the city, in an effort to encircle and cut off Ukrainian troops tasked with holding it. In the last couple of days, the Russians have advanced into several villages south of Lysychansk, though not without sustaining losses from Ukrainian artillery fire. Indeed, the Ukrainian military claims that some Russian battalion tactical groups are being consolidated or withdrawn to restore their combat capabilities. The Institute for the Study of War, in its latest daily analysis of the battlefield, says the Russian breakthrough from the south means they ""may be able to threaten Lysychansk in the coming days while avoiding a difficult opposed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets River."" The settlements that Ukrainian officials confirmed as lost Wednesday are all on the western Siverskyi Donets Riverbank, within 10 kilometers of the southern outskirts of the city. ""The Russians are approaching Lysychansk, entrenching in nearby towns. The city is being shelled by aircraft,"" according to Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk regional military administration. Hayday acknowledged it was ""difficult"" in the area south of Lysychansk. ""The enemy entered Toshkivka, which allowed it to increase fire on other settlements."" He said Russian forces were entrenched in several villages immediately to the south of Lysychansk, including Ustynivka, Pidlisne and Myrna Dolyna, and were advancing at Bila Hora. ""It is not easy for our soldiers to keep the defense,"" he admitted. Throughout its campaign, Russia has used the tactic of intense bombardment before trying to take territory. Hayday's comments suggest that Ukrainian defenses around Lysychansk have begun to succumb to much greater Russian firepower, after weeks of bombardment. Ukrainian forces continue to fight on the fringes of the neigboring city of Severodonetsk, and in adjacent communities -- and they benefit from higher ground in Lysychansk. But their already-compromised supply lines are becoming more tenuous, and the sheer magnitude of Russian firepower is grinding down defensive positions. The reverses suffered in the past few days, after weeks of determined resistance, probably mark the most difficult week for the Ukrainian military since the surrender of the last defenders in Mariupol. The attacks near Lysychansk are being carried out in tandem with renewed Russian efforts to cut the highway that runs west to Bakhmut, a critical line of communication for the Ukrainians. In some places, Russian forces are within a few kilometers of the highway. The Ukrainian defense of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk has consumed the firepower of many Russian units and blunted their efforts to make progress in the neighboring Donetsk region. However, the Russians can still call on reserves being held in nearby areas of southwest Russia -- while some of Ukraine's best units are seriously depleted by months of missile, rocket, artillery and air attacks. But if the Ukrainians decide to dig in around Lysychansk, it will likely require substantial Russian efforts, possibly over weeks, to take it. By then it may resemble the partially flattened cities of Severodonetsk, nearby Popasna and Mariupol.",14,2.414736690541685,5.157072209986883,-2.742335519445198,21
2022-06-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/politics/microsoft-russia-hackings/index.html,Microsoft says Russia has stepped up cyber espionage against the US and Ukraine allies,"Russian intelligence agencies have increased their efforts to hack US and allied government computer networks to gather intelligence since the war in Ukraine began, Microsoft said in new findings published Wednesday. American organizations were the top target of the Russian hacking attempts outside of Ukraine, according to Microsoft, but the alleged Russian hacking has spanned 42 countries, and a range of sectors that might have valuable information related to the war, from governments to think tanks to humanitarian groups. It's a reminder of the voracious appetite that Russian cyber operatives have for strategic information as the Kremlin is more isolated on the international stage than it has been for decades. Those hacking attempts have successfully penetrated defenses 29% of the time, according to Microsoft. Of those successful breaches, a quarter resulted in data stolen from networks. But measuring the ""success"" of a Russian cyber-espionage is difficult, and Microsoft said it didn't have a full view of the hacking because some customers stored data on their own systems rather than in Microsoft's cloud computing infrastructure. CNN has reached out to the Russian Embassy in Washington for comment. Moscow routinely denies hacking accusations. Various governments have likely stepped up their offensive cyber activities related to the Ukraine war as they search for insights on the fighting and the global fallout from it. Cyber Command, the US military's hacking unit, has conducted a ""full spectrum"" of offensive, defensive and information operations in support of Ukraine, the head of the command confirmed this month. China, too, has trained some of its very capable hackers on targets related to the Ukraine war, according to cybersecurity researchers. Suspected Chinese hackers appeared to try to break into computers linked to officials in the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk, near the Chinese border, according to cybersecurity firm Secureworks. US officials continue to study Russia's efforts to supplement its kinetic war in Ukraine with cyber operations. Significant alleged Russian hacking incidents in Ukraine since the February invasion include a hack of a satellite operator, which knocked out internet service for tens of thousands of satellite modems as the invasion unfolded, and waves of data-wiping hacks aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian government agencies. Ukrainian officials have also accused the Russians of routing internet traffic in occupied parts of Ukraine through Russian internet providers and subjecting those connections to censorship. Some of those tactics ""may form parts of China's playbook"" in future attempts by Beijing to project power beyond its borders, according to Mieke Eoyang, deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy. ""The cyber dimensions of [what Russia is trying doing in Ukraine] are incredibly important to us, especially in the Defense Department, to understand what the playbook might be if another cyber-capable country were to attempt to do this,"" Eoyang said Tuesday at an event in Washington hosted by the think tank Third Way. NATO members a focus for Russian hackers NATO, the 30-country military alliance that includes the US, Canada and European allies, has been a particular target for Russia's computer operatives, according to the Microsoft report. After the US, Poland -- a hub for delivering humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine -- was the NATO member targeted the most by Russian hackers in recent months, Microsoft researchers found. Prospective, and not just current, NATO members have had to keep their guard up for potential Russian cyberattacks. The governments of Sweden and Finland have been vigilant for Russian hacking before and after they announced their intention to join NATO in May. Swedish officials for months have encouraged critical infrastructure operators to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious cyber activity to authorities, said Johan Turell, a senior analyst in the cybersecurity department of the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, a government organization that prepares for natural and man-made crises. The Kremlin has warned Sweden and Finland, which shares hundreds of miles of border with Russia, against joining NATO. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by video conference with the Finnish parliament on April 8, a cyberattack briefly knocked offline the websites of Finland's ministries of foreign affairs and defense. The websites quickly came back online. Some digital forensics specialists linked the hack, which did not cause any serious disruption, to Russia. ""We don't know if this was Russian patriotic hackers or an entity linked more directly to [the] Russian government,"" Mikko Hyppönen, a prominent Finnish cybersecurity executive, told CNN. ""But I have no doubt that the attack was Russian,"" he said after reviewing the technical evidence. ""If Russia is trying to scare us with these attacks, they are failing,"" said Hyppönen, who is chief research officer at cybersecurity firm WithSecure.

The organization said it found several bullets and cartridge casings at the scene, the identity papers of the friend and soldier that was accompanying Levin, and identified 14 bullet impacts in the car they were traveling in. RSF said it also found several items with possible DNA evidence, attesting to the presence of Russian soldiers in the vicinity of the crime scene and, crucially, located a bullet right next to the spot where Levin's body was found. ""Analysis of the photos of the crime scene, the observations made on the spot and the material evidence recovered clearly point to an execution that may have been preceded by interrogation or even acts of torture,"" RSF Secretary General Christophe Delore said of the report. ""In the context of a war heavily marked by propaganda and Kremlin censorship, Maks Levin and his friend paid with their lives for their fight for reliable information.""

2022-06-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/europe/kaliningrad-explainer-russia-lithuania-sanctions-intl/index.html,"Why Kaliningrad, Russia's toehold in Europe, could be the next flashpoint in its war against Ukraine","Tensions are mounting around the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, an isolated but strategically significant territory on the Baltic coast that could soon be dragged into the Kremlin's war. Russia has reacted furiously after Lithuania banned the passage of sanctioned goods across its territory and into Kaliningrad. But Lithuania says it is merely upholding European Union sanctions, and the European bloc has backed it. The row now threatens to escalate strains between Moscow and the EU, which has unveiled several packages of sanctions on Russian goods. Here's what you need to know about Kaliningrad, its history and its importance to Russia. What sparked this row? Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, experts have feared that Kaliningrad could become a flashpoint in tensions between Moscow and Europe. It is Russia's westernmost territory, and the only part of the country surrounded by EU states; Lithuania stands between it and Belarus, a Russian ally nation, while Poland borders it to the south. On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the move was unprecedented and that Russia considered it illegal. ""It is part of a blockade, of course,"" he said. Other Russian officials have threatened a response. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, said, ""Russia will certainly respond to such hostile actions. Measures are being worked out in an interdepartmental format and will be taken in the near future. Their consequences will have a serious negative impact on the Lithuanian population,"" according to Russia's RIA Novosti state-owned news agency. The sanctioned products barred from being exported to Russian territory by the European Union include construction machinery, machine tools and other industrial equipment, according to Russian state news agency TASS, citing the Ministry for Economic Development. Some luxury goods are also included. Lithuania has not imposed ""unilateral, individual or additional"" restrictions, its foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday. The Charge d'Affaires of Lithuania in Moscow was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday and told that if freight transit to the Kaliningrad region was not fully restored, Russia reserved the right to take actions to protect its national interests. But the EU, whose sanctions Lithuania is enforcing by blocking transit, has backed its member state. Speaking to Reuters, Dmitry Lyskov, a representative of the regional government, was forced to urge residents not to panic buy in response to the spat. The sanctioned products will now have to travel by sea. A Lithuanian official, Rolandas Kacinskas, said Tuesday that ""the transit of passengers and EU non-sanctioned goods to the Kaliningrad region through the territory of Lithuania continues uninterrupted. [Lithuania] hasn't imposed any unilateral, individual, or additional restrictions on the transit & is acting fully in accordance with EU law."" What is Kaliningrad? Kaliningrad is a Russian exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. It was captured by Soviet troops from Nazi Germany in April 1945 and then became part of Soviet territory as a result of the Potsdam Agreement. It was renamed from the German Königsberg in 1946. For decades, it was a heavily militarized region, closed off to foreigners. But in recent years Kaliningrad has become an emerging tourist destination, and it hosted matches during Russia's 2018 World Cup. It has a population of around one million, the majority of whom live within or near the capital city of the same name. The exclave is one of the more prosperous regions of Russia, with extensive industry. Its port, Baltiysk, is the westernmost harbor in Russian territory and, significantly, is ice-free throughout the year. The streets of the main city are lined with grand examples of old German architecture alongside grim, concrete Soviet apartment blocks. But Kaliningrad's significance comes mostly from where it lies on the map. A thin strip of land south of Kaliningrad separates it from Belarus and connects Polish and Lithuanian territory. Known as the Suwalki corridor or gap, it is the only overland link between the Baltic states and the rest of the European Union. Kaliningrad is also the headquarters of the Russian Baltic Fleet. RIA Novosti reported Monday that the fleet had begun previously planned rocket and artillery drills, saying that ""about 1,000 military personnel and more than 100 units of military and special equipment of artillery and missile units are involved in the maneuvers."" In 2002, the EU and Moscow reached an agreement on travel between Russia and Kaliningrad, ahead of Poland and Lithuania joining the European Union in 2004. When those countries joined, the exclave became surrounded on three sides by EU territory. Russia says the 2002 agreement has now been violated. Nuclear presence? Kaliningrad's importance has become even greater to Russia with the planned accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Russian National Security Council said in May that the accession plans meant it ""will no longer be possible to talk about any non-nuclear status of the Baltics -- the balance must be restored."" Russia has long balked at the presence of NATO countries around Kaliningrad. ""They moved NATO infrastructure next to our borders,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told CNN in 2015, after reports that Russia had moved nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to the region. ""And this is not United States territory."" Russia has not acknowledged that it has nuclear weapons based in Kaliningrad, but in 2018 the Federation of American Scientists concluded that Russia had significantly modernized a nuclear weapons storage bunker in the region, based on analysis of satellite imagery. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania has urged NATO to increase the deployment of troops on its territory. In April, President Gitanas Nauseda said that NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence Battalion should be transformed into ""at least"" the size of a brigade, and called for reinforcement of the Suwalki corridor.",29,4.344118974748345,4.059028686406275,0.2850902883420705,9
2022-06-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/europe/russia-ukraine-severodonetsk-cmd-intl/index.html,"Two months on, Russia is still struggling to capture this small Ukrainian city","It's been nearly two months since Russian forces began their assault on the city of Severodonetsk. But despite overwhelming firepower, they still can't dislodge determined Ukrainian resistance -- nor cut the supply lines that provide the city's remaining defenders with a drip-feed of weapons and ammunition. The fierce Ukrainian defense of Severodonetsk, despite heavy losses, has forced the Russians to concentrate firepower on a relatively small area and held up their efforts to seize the 10% of Luhansk region they still do not control. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the seizure of Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions as one of the objectives of Moscow's special military operation that began in February. For now, that operation is largely stalled; a large part of Donetsk remains beyond the Russians' reach. Russian forces are making modest gains -- the Russian Defense Ministry said Sunday that the town of Metelkino just southeast of Severodonetsk had been taken. But the Russians' goal of encircling the Ukrainian troops defending the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk still appears some way off. In a campaign lacking agility and imagination, the Russians have resorted to one principal tactic: overwhelming indirect fire against any and all Ukrainian positions, regardless of the collateral destruction. The aim is to leave nothing standing that can be defended. The use of troops on the ground to take and hold urban areas has been less frequent and less successful. In a video of Ukrainian special forces in the area released at the weekend, one unidentified Ukrainian soldier says: ""They are throwing everything they have, all the munitions they have. It doesn't matter for them if it's our positions or civilian areas, they wipe everything from the face of earth and then they use artillery and then they start moving forward little by little."" Amid intense urban combat, some 500 civilians, including dozens of children, have taken shelter in the Azot chemical plant in Severodonetsk. Unlike the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, it offers little protection below ground. Ukrainian officials say people there, who previously refused to leave, do have food supplies but can no longer be evacuated from the plant because of the intense fighting. But as with Azovstal, the Azot plant and its immediate surroundings have become the focal point of Ukrainian resistance -- frustrating Russian commanders. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank in Washington, ""Russian troops are likely facing mounting losses and troop and equipment degradation that will complicate attempts to renew offensive operations on other critical locations as the slow battle for Severodonetsk continues."" Just as the defense of Mariupol drew in more than a dozen battalion tactical groups, so overcoming resistance in Severodonetsk is proving labor-intensive. Grinding down resistance The Ukrainians claim to have inflicted heavy losses on Russian forces in the area -- in part thanks to new equipment from Western allies, including anti-tank weapons and longer-range howitzers supplied by the United States and France. On Saturday, the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that units of Russia's 11th Separate Motorized Rifle Regiment had suffered significant losses and were ""withdrawn from the area of combat operations to restore combat capability."" However, Ukrainian supply lines are under constant attack, and it has become more difficult to ferry supplies from further west in Donetsk region along the highway to Lysychansk. The ISW still expects that ""Russian forces will likely be able to seize Severodonetsk in the coming weeks, but at the cost of concentrating most of their available forces in this small area."" The Russians' tactics so far suggest a campaign to grind down resistance south of the city -- in places like Syrotyne -- and then attack Ukrainian defenses from several directions. Ukrainian officials say the Russians are increasingly using drones to identify their defensive positions. ""The Russian military monitors the air day and night with drones, adjusts firepower, quickly adapts to our changes in defensive areas,"" said Serhii Hayday, head of the Luhansk regional military administration. Elsewhere along an active frontline that stretches for more than 1,000 kilometers (more than 620 miles), little territory is currently ceded or taken. The Russians' principal goals in Donbas are to take the industrial city and transport hub of Sloviansk and the town of Bakhmut, both in Donetsk -- but they've made very limited progress towards either objective. They may also be vulnerable to Ukrainian counterattacks south and west of the city of Izium. Southern Ukraine represents a different picture. The Russians appear to be consolidating gains won in the opening days of the war, along lines that allow them to defend a coastal belt in depth. Ukrainian counterattacks towards Kherson city have made limited progress, as the Russians are now well dug-in and show little appetite for trying to win more territory. As UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson put it Sunday, after his second visit to Kyiv: ""Time is the vital factor. Everything will depend on whether Ukraine can strengthen its ability to defend its soil faster than Russia can renew its capacity to attack."" Brittle morale Some of Ukraine's best military units have been punished during the defense of Donbas. Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told CNN last week that tens of thousands of Ukrainians had been killed since the Russian invasion began on February 24. Probably the vast majority have been soldiers. The UK Defense Ministry assessed this weekend that Ukrainian forces have likely suffered desertions in recent weeks -- though it believes Russian morale is much more brittle. So, it's not solely about getting accurate long-range weapons to Ukrainian forces but also stepping up training. Johnson is pushing a plan whereby allies develop the potential to train up to 10,000 soldiers every 120 days. Despite their losses, and even as they deploy vintage T62 tanks in some places, Russian forces retain huge superiority in armor and combat aviation. And despite a ponderous and predictable strategy, they can continue to obliterate Ukrainian defenses. Video emerged at the weekend revealing the scale of destruction in Lyman, near Sloviansk, just as Popasna and Rubizhne further east were leveled in April. But with an accelerated flow of weapons capable of blunting Russia's advantage in heavy artillery and rocket systems, Ukrainian forces might yet prevent the enemy from inflicting such devastation on more towns and cities further west.",14,2.8741164173028397,5.656746496419352,-2.782630079116512,21

""We still are trying to learn more about these two individuals,"" said John Kirby, the coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council. ""It's appalling that a public official in Russia would even suggest the death penalty for two American citizens that were in Ukraine. And we're going to continue to try and learn what we can about this,"" he said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday the Geneva Convention -- the charter that sets out how soldiers and civilians are treated in wartime, including banning execution of prisoners of war -- does not apply to the two detained US citizens. Peskov said the death penalty could not be ruled out, but that it was a decision for a court and not the Kremlin. Kirby said he wouldn't try and get into Peskov's or Vladimir Putin's heads, but he added whether the prospect of the death penalty was real or hypothetical, it was troubling no matter what. ""Either way, it's equally alarming, whether they actually mean what they're saying here and this could be an outcome, that they could levy a death penalty against two Americans in Ukraine,"" he said. ""Or that they just feel it's a responsible thing for a major power to do, to talk about doing this as a way of signaling to the President of the United States and the American people. Either one of them is equally alarming."" Two American volunteers fighting for Ukraine were taken into detention by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk after being captured last week, according to Russian state media. US citizens Alexander John-Robert Drueke, 39, from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, from Hartselle, Alabama, were interviewed by Russia's RT channel at a detention center in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) on Friday, according to a report published on RT. The two Americans went missing on June 9 during a battle north of Kharkiv and it was feared that they may have been captured by Russian forces, according to their families and a fellow fighter. On Friday, short video clips surfaced on pro-Russian channels and social media appearing to show the men detained at an unknown location. At the time it was not clear who was holding them. A State Department spokesperson told CNN on Friday they ""have seen the photos and videos of these two US citizens reportedly captured by Russia's military forces in Ukraine"" and were ""closely monitoring the situation."" ""We are in contact with Ukrainian authorities, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and with the families themselves,"" they continued. ""Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment on these cases."" Separately, a more than 50-minute edited video was published on Saturday of Drueke and Huynh being interviewed by HelmCast, a pro-Russian Serbian nationalist YouTube channel. In the interview, a man can be heard behind the camera revealing the location of their interview when he says, ""here in Donetsk"" during a question to Drueke. Drueke is also asked in the interview if he has any objections to how he has been treated since his capture and he reveals he has been beaten. CNN is choosing not to broadcast the videos of US detainees because they show the men speaking under duress. The location of Drueke and Huynh's detention is a potentially concerning development.

Concerning development The location of Drueke and Huynh's detention is a potentially concerning development. Russia has a moratorium on the death penalty, whereas Donetsk uses firing squads to execute condemned prisoners, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti. On June 9, a court in DPR sentenced foreign fighters, two British citizens and a Moroccan national, to death after accusing them of being ""mercenaries"" for Ukraine. The internationally unrecognized court in DPR said the men had a month to appeal their verdicts. Hopes that a prisoner swap between Ukraine and the pro-Russian separatists could free any foreign fighters detained in Donetsk appeared to have been dashed after Denis Pushilin, the self-proclaimed head of DPR, said such exchanges were out of the question. ""The exchange of the British men sentenced to death in the DPR is not under discussion, there are no grounds for pardoning them,"" Pushilin told independent Russian investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta on Thursday. The Donetsk People's Republic did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the detention of Drueke and Huynh. Former serviceman describes battle Speaking exclusively to CNN's Sam Kiley, a former US serviceman fighting with Ukrainian forces recounted the battle he witnessed on June 9, when Huynh and Drueke were purportedly captured. The man, who asked to be identified with the code name ""Pip,"" said his team was sent out on a mission east of Kharkiv where a full-scale Russian armored assault was underway. Huynh and Drueke fired an RPG at a BMP -- an infantry fighting vehicle -- that was coming through the woods and destroyed it, according to Pip. But the team had to quickly withdraw as more than 100 Russian infantry began advancing and the American fighters found themselves in a village they previously thought was in Ukrainian hands. When asked about what happened to Huynh and Drueke, Pip said that ""we suspect they were knocked out by either the T-72 tank shooting at them or by the blast of the mine. This is only speculation, we don't know what really happened to them."" Separately, a man who was acting as the team's sergeant and who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons, previously told CNN it ""was absolute chaos."" ""There was about a hundred plus infantry advancing on our positions. We had a T-72 firing on people from 30, 40 meters away,"" he said. A photo of the two men emerged on Thursday with their hands tied behind them and in the back of a Russian truck. The undated photo was posted on Telegram on Thursday by a Russian blogger. CNN could not independently verify when the photo was taken. Third American missing A third American, whom the State Department has said is missing in action in Ukraine, was identified as US Marine veteran Grady Kurpasi, his wife confirmed to CNN on Thursday. The last time Heeson Kim and other close friends heard from Kurpasi was between April 23 and 24, George Heath, a family friend of Kurpasi's told CNN. Kurpasi served in the US Marine Corps for 20 years, retiring in November 2021. He chose to volunteer alongside Ukrainians in Ukraine but initially did not envision himself fighting on the frontlines of the war, Heath said. On Friday, US President Joe Biden said he has been briefed on the three Americans missing in Ukraine. In remarks to reporters, Biden said repeatedly Americans should not travel to Ukraine at this time.

In separate comments published Sunday, Stoltenberg and Johnson also reiterated that Western governments must continue to support Ukraine to deter future aggression by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Stoltenberg told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag that nobody knew how long the conflict would last but ""we need to prepare for the fact that it could take years."" ""We must not cease to support Ukraine. Even if the costs are high, not only for military support, but also because of rising energy and food prices."" Boris Johnson, writing in the Sunday Times after his second visit to Kyiv on Friday, said Western allies must ""steel ourselves for a long war, as Putin resorts to a campaign of attrition, trying to grind down Ukraine by sheer brutality."" Johnson said that seizing all of Ukraine's Donbas, which covers much of eastern Ukraine, had been Putin's objective for the last eight years ""when he ignited a separatist rebellion and launched his first invasion."" While Russia was still short of this goal, ""Putin may not realise it but his grand imperial design for the total reconquest of Ukraine has been derailed. In his isolation, he may still think total conquest is possible."" Both men stressed the need to avert future Russian aggression. Stoltenberg said: ""If Putin learns the lesson from this war that he can just carry on as he did after the Georgia war in 2008 and the occupation of Crimea in 2014, then we will pay a much higher price."" Johnson asked what would happen if President Putin was free to keep all the areas of Ukraine now controlled by Russian forces. ""What if no one was willing to lift a finger as he annexed this conquered territory and its fearful people into a greater Russia? Would this bring peace?"" Johnson said that through firm long-term support for Ukraine, ""we and our allies will be protecting our own security as much as Ukraine's and safeguarding the world from the lethal dreams of Putin and those who might seek to copy them."" Johnson wrote: ""Time is the vital factor. Everything will depend on whether Ukraine can strengthen its ability to defend its soil faster than Russia can renew its capacity to attack. Our task is to enlist time on Ukraine's side."" 'Strategic advantage' On Sunday, Ukrainian officials said heavy fighting continues in the city of Severodonetsk -- the epicenter of the bloody battle for Ukraine's eastern Donbas region -- and surrounding communities as Russian forces try to break the resistance of Ukrainian defenders and capture parts of the eastern Luhansk region they don't already control. Serhii Hayday, head of the regional military administration, said the ""battles for Severodonetsk continue,"" and that the sprawling Azot chemical plant, where some 500 civilians are sheltering, had been shelled again. Russian operations appear designed to break Ukrainian defenses to the south of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, cutting off Ukrainian units still defending the two strategically important cities. To the west, in the Donetsk region, also in the Donbas, the Ukrainian military reported further shelling of Ukrainian positions near Sloviansk. There was also a missile strike in the area, according to an operational update by the Ukrainian General Staff. But there appears to have been little change in frontline positions. Stoltenberg was cautiously optimistic that Ukraine could turn the tide of the war. ""Although the battle in Donbass is being waged more and more brutally by Russia, Ukrainian soldiers are fighting valiantly. With more modern weapons, the probability increases that Ukraine will be able to drive Putin's troops out of Donbas again."" Ukraine's military has been burning through Soviet-era ammunition that fits older systems. While Western weapon systems are arriving, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned this week that they needed to come faster as Russia amasses a significant artillery advantage around the two cities in eastern Ukraine. US officials insist that Western arms are still flowing to the front lines of the fight. But local reports of weapons shortages -- and frustrated pleas from Ukrainian officials on the front lines -- have raised questions about how effectively supply lines are running. The Biden administration announced Wednesday it was providing an additional $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine, a package that includes shipments of additional howitzers, ammunition and coastal defense systems. While the UK ""plans to work with our friends to prepare Ukrainian forces to defend their country, with the potential to train up to 10,000 soldiers every 120 days,"" Johnson said. While Russia has been making incremental gains in eastern Ukraine, Johnson stressed the attrition of Russian forces in the grinding battles, saying Russia would need ""years, perhaps decades, to replace this hardware. And hour by hour Russian forces are expending equipment and ammunition faster than their factories can produce them."" In late May, Ukrainian officials said Russian units were being reinforced by mothballed Soviet-era T-62 tanks, which appeared to have been brought out of storage. The British Prime Minister added: ""The UK and our friends must respond by ensuring that Ukraine has the strategic endurance to survive and eventually prevail."" He laid out four essential steps to support Ukraine, which included: preserving the Ukrainian state which includes: ensuring the country receives ""weapons, equipment, ammunition and training more rapidly than the invader and build up its capacity to use our help;"" a ""long-term effort to develop"" alternative overland routes to overcome Russia's ""stranglehold on Ukraine's economy by blockading its principal export routes across the Black Sea."" This weekend, Zelensky visited the frontlines in the coastal city of Odesa and southern city of Mykolaiv, which are both Russian targets in its attempt to seize the Black Sea coast. Johnson added that Russian blockade of Black Sea ports meant that some ""25 million tonnes of corn and wheat -- the entire annual consumption of all the least developed countries -- is piled up in silos across Ukraine."" On the forthcoming NATO summit in Madrid, Stoltenberg said that a new strategy concept will be adopted ""will declare that Russia is no longer a partner, but a threat to our security, peace and stability."" He said that ""Russia's nuclear saber rattling is dangerous and irresponsible. Putin must know that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be waged.""",14,6.901237596004981,4.213288416299544,2.687949179705438,21

The last time Heeson Kim and other close friends heard from Kurpasi was between April 23 and 24, George Heath, a family friend of Kurpasi's told CNN. Kurpasi served in the US Marine Corps for 20 years, retiring in November 2021. He chose to volunteer alongside Ukrainians in Ukraine but initially did not envision himself fighting on the frontlines of the war, Heath said. ""For him personally, he has a skill set that he feels he can give back,"" he said of Kurpasi. ""He wanted to go and help the Ukrainian people. He wasn't really planning on fighting."" The State Department said it was aware of reports of a third American who traveled to Ukraine to fight against Russia who has been identified ""in recent weeks"" as missing, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said during a press briefing on Thursday. Price did not give the name of the third reportedly missing American, but said the State Department was in touch with the family. Kurpasi arrived in Ukraine on March 7 and made it to Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, on March 21, Heath said. Kurpasi and other members of the foreign legion were tasked to man an observation post at the end of April near Kherson, around the time Kurpasi stopped communicating with his wife and friends back in the US, Heath said. The foreign legion is a group of foreign fighters who have volunteered to fight alongside Ukrainians against Russia's invasion of the country. It is not clear if Kurpasi was a member of the foreign legion, but he was a volunteer fighting alongside Ukrainians, Heath said. Kurpasi and foreign legion troops manning the post at the time started ""receiving small arms fire"" on April 26, Heath said, meaning they were getting shot at. Kurpasi and the other soldier ""went to go investigate what was happening,"" so they left the observation post, Heath said. Kurpasi then radioed to Ukrainian military to start firing back and ""that was the last time anyone heard from him,"" said Heath, who has reconstructed the account from other foreign legion members he's spoken with in the weeks since Kurpasi has gone missing. The State Department told Kim that Kurpasi was missing in action on April 28, Heath said. The reason he has been identified as missing in action is because his body has not been found or identified, he added. Kurpasi's ""goal was not to be in firefights doing stuff like that,"" when he went to Ukraine, Heath said. ""It just ended up being that way in the end,"" he added. Kurpasi joined the US Marines after the September 11 terrorist attacks and had four deployments during his service, including three to Iraq. He was a decorated service member who won the Good Conduct Medal three times, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal three times, the Purple Heart medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, among other awards, according to his military service record. Heath described Kurpasi, his platoon commander in the US Marines from 2012 to 2014, as a ""great leader."" ""He always led from the front. He always took care of his Marines,"" he said. After retiring from the Marines last fall, Kurpasi applied to a PhD program at Stanford University. He did not get into the program but was applying to other doctorate programs while he was in Ukraine, Heath said. Kurpasi's last post in the military was at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. He was living in Wilmington, North Carolina, before he left for Ukraine, another family friend, Jason Tokushige, told CNN. New photo emerges Price said the State Department is in contact with the families of the two other US citizens reportedly captured in the country, as well as Ukrainian authorities and the International Committee of the Red Cross, but that they similarly could not confirm reports that these two citizens were captured. On Wednesday, CNN reported that Alexander John-Robert Drueke, 39, from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, from Hartselle, Alabama -- who had been fighting alongside Ukrainian forces north of Kharkiv -- have been missing for nearly a week and there are fears that they may have been captured by Russian forces, according to their families and a fellow fighter. A photo emerged on Thursday of Drueke and Huynh in the back of a Russian military truck, apparently confirming they had been captured by Russian forces north of Kharkiv last week. CNN could not independently verify when the photo was taken. The image shows the two men looking up at the camera with their hands behind their backs, as if they are bound. The undated photo was posted on Telegram on Thursday by a Russian blogger. The US State Department on Thursday told the family of one of the Americans missing in Ukraine that there is potential evidence of capture of Drueke, but could not verify the photo at the time, Bunny Drueke, Alexander's mother, told CNN. ""They said that there is a photograph that is being circulated on the Russian media. And they're working hard to verify it,"" Drueke told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead."" ""We're very hopeful."" Drueke said her son went to Ukraine to train soldiers there to fight against Russia because ""he felt that if Putin wasn't stopped now, he would just become bolder with every success, and that eventually he might end up on American shores."" There is very little to identify the location of the vehicle seen in the photo, but a white box of food with tin cans falling out has been identified by CNN as being ""mackerel with vegetables"" made by a Russian food producer. CNN has reached out to Russia's Ministry of Defense for comment. No Russian contact Price said the US is not in contact with Russia about the reportedly captured American citizens because they do not yet have ""credible reason"" to believe the Russians have captured them and also because Russia has not claimed to have captured them. ""If we feel that such outreach through our embassy in Moscow or otherwise would be productive in terms of finding out more information on the whereabouts of these individuals, we won't hesitate to do that,"" said Price. Price also said the US is in contact with ""other partners,"" including the United Kingdom, over ""this issue broadly."" The department spokesman cautioned Americans against traveling to the country amid the conflict with Russia. ""We continue to urge in every way we can American citizens not to travel to Ukraine because of the attendant dangers that is posed by Russia's ongoing aggression,"" he said.

2022-06-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/politics/russia-syria-warning/index.html,Russia warned US it was going to conduct airstrikes on fighters in Syria,"Russia warned the US military earlier this week that it was going to conduct airstrikes against local fighters allied with the US in southeastern Syria, according to two US defense officials. That led the US to quickly warn the fighters to move their positions and also ensure that no US forces were nearby. US forces did not have to move, as they were far enough away, but the local fighters did, the officials told CNN. The Russian airstrikes appear highly calculated, coming when tensions are high between Washington and Moscow over the war in Ukraine and the Pentagon is trying to ensure tensions don't escalate with Russian forces, including in Syria, where the two sides have operated in proximity to each other for several years. The initial US assessment is the Russian forces were likely ordered to notify the US ahead of time and conduct the airstrikes knowing they would not hit US troops and that the Americans would warn their allies, the officials said. But the Russians still likely achieved their goal of ""sending a message"" to the US that they can strike without being worried about retaliation, one official said. The notification by Russia came through the long-standing bilateral deconfliction line that has operated for several years, where each side notifies the other of military operations and movements that risk a miscalculation if each side is not aware of the other's activities. The US view is the Russians were minimizing the risk of a crisis, knowing the US would notify the local fighters. The incident happened in the vicinity of Al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria, where US and Syrian opposition forces have long operated. The strikes were conducted against positions where the US-backed Maghawir al-Thawra fighters were operating. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but property is believed to have been damaged. The US officials said the Russians claimed the group had conducted a roadside bomb attack against Russian forces. The US believes that did not happen and the Russians simply used it as a reason to conduct airstrikes. This kind of Russian provocation is rare but not unprecedented. In February 2018, an encounter rapidly escalated and became deadly when a 500-strong force largely made up of Russian contractors and a Christian militia loyal to the Syrian regime crossed the Euphrates river near Deir Ezzor. The Russians were working for a paramilitary company called Wagner, which had hundreds of contractors on the ground in Syria, helping the Russian military and pro-regime forces. The mission of that night's operation remains unclear, but the forces were advancing toward a valuable oil and gas field, Coneco, controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed militia that has been fighting ISIS in Syria. When the pro-regime forces began shelling a base held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the US responded with heavy airstrikes and artillery fire, which continued for about three hours. US commanders tried to reach their Russian counterparts through deconfliction channels to warn of their response. But by the time communications were established, the counterattack was underway. And in August 2020, multiple US troops were injured in a collision with a Russian military convoy in eastern Syria.",14,2.174025340472222,4.636830464992263,-2.4628051245200413,29
2022-06-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/15/politics/latvian-foreign-minister-interview/index.html,Latvian foreign minister says European leaders should not fear provoking Putin and must not push Ukraine to make concessions,"Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs on Wednesday said European leaders must not be deterred by a fear of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin and the international community must not pressure Ukraine into making concessions to end the war. In an exclusive interview with CNN in Washington, DC, Rinkēvičs also outlined Latvia's key goals for NATO's approach to the eastern flank -- namely, a long-term military presence -- and expressed concern about the mounting food crisis caused by Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports. Rinkēvičs' visit to DC came as US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that ""Ukraine is facing pivotal moment on the battlefield"" and the Biden administration unveiled a new tranche of military assistance to Ukraine -- a move to bolster Kyiv as the war nears the end of its fourth month. The Latvian foreign minister will meet with lawmakers and Biden administration officials while in the nation's capital ahead of the NATO Summit in Madrid later this month. 'Not rational' Although Rinkēvičs did not name names in his critique of European leaders who he says maintain a ""fear"" of vexing Putin, he told CNN he was referencing ""those who are well-known from time to time openly saying that they don't want to see him humiliated or that we need to provide some off-ramp"" -- a seeming swipe at French President Emmanuel Macron, who in early June said ""we must not humiliate Russia so that the day when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means."" Rinkēvičs said such an approach is ""not rational,"" telling CNN that the ""mentality in many of the capitals needs to be changed."" He also noted that diplomatic outreach by world leaders to Putin in an attempt to get him to end the war had not yielded results, and said he believed the Russians ""can be stopped only by Ukrainians, only by them fighting."" The foreign minister said the war in Ukraine was bigger than the Russian leader, noting that they wouldn't be able to commit the war ""without the support of the population ... without this kind of brainwashing of the people via propaganda channels."" He praised the United States for its military support for Ukraine, and said that European allies ought to scale up their wartime industrial production, noting that ""we had those nice 20-plus years of downsizing militaries, getting rid of all this stuff, and then now suddenly, we need for our own defense, we need to arm Ukraine."" Moreover, Rinkēvičs told CNN that ""nobody should push Ukraine to provide concessions to Russia"" -- concessions like ceding territory to Moscow in order to stop the war. Although this might work for some time, the foreign minister cast doubt that it would be a permanent deterrent to future Russian aggression. ""Let's not make this mistake again. Russia is not making this war about NATO expansion or keeping Ukraine out of NATO or EU. It's about destroying Ukraine, getting land, restoring empire,"" he said. In order to prevent future military aggression by Moscow, Rinkēvičs said that ""Russia needs to be in a situation where its war and economic machine is in such a state that it cannot launch any military offensive operation,"" and although he does not see sanctions ending the current war, they could help deter a future one. Send a 'clear message to Russia' As NATO leaders prepare to meet in the Spanish capital later this month, Rinkēvičs said Latvia, which borders both Russia and Belarus, sees very specific measures that should be carried out to enhance security in the Baltics, the foremost of which is a long-term NATO troop presence. The foreign minister told CNN it was crucial to send ""a clear message to Russia"" that it is NATO territory, and ""not an inch"" will be ceded, acknowledging that Madrid would only be the start of the discussion and decision process. ""What we want to avoid is the situation where parts of the Baltics that's all of a sudden occupied and then they are liberated by NATO troops and then we get new Buchas or Mariupols,"" Rinkēvičs said, referencing the names of areas of Ukraine were mass atrocities have been committed. ""So what we are talking (about) internally, this is a change of the kind of deterrence and defense sort of (through) punishment to defense and deterrence through denial, denial to get into the Baltics,"" he said.",29,3.610240444635325,2.073479263419616,1.536761181215709,20
2022-06-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/politics/ukraine-war-pivotal-moment-intelligence-officials-loses-in-the-east-russia/index.html,"War in Ukraine reaches pivotal moment that could determine long-term outcome, intelligence officials say","Ukraine's military is burning through Soviet-era ammunition that fits older systems as the country pleads with the West to send more heavy weaponry and Russia amasses a significant artillery advantage around two strategically important cities in eastern Ukraine. Western intelligence and military officials believe Russia's war in Ukraine is in a critical stage that could determine the long-term outcome of the conflict, according to multiple sources familiar with US and other Western intelligence. This pivotal moment could also force a tough decision for Western governments, which have up until now offered support to Ukraine at a steadily increasing cost to their own economies and national stockpiles of weapons. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is poised to lead a working group of nearly 50 countries to discuss the crisis on Wednesday, when the US expects more announcements of weapons and equipment packages for Ukraine, according to a senior US defense official. Ukrainian officials have expressed frustration that these vital munitions appear to be trickling into the fight piecemeal -- and have raised fears that Western commitment may be softening at a decisive moment. ""I think that you're about to get to the point where one side or the other will be successful,"" said a senior NATO official. ""Either the Russians will reach Slovyansk and Kramatorsk or the Ukrainians will stop them here. And if the Ukrainians are able to hold the line here, in the face of this number forces, that will matter."" Three potential outcomes Western officials are closely watching three possible scenarios that they believe could unfold: Russia could continue to make incremental gains in two key eastern provinces. Or the battle lines could harden into a stalemate that drags on for months or years, leading to tremendous casualties on both sides and a slow-rolling crisis that will continue to be a drain on the global economy. Then there is what officials consider the least likely possibility: Russia could redefine its war aims, announce that it has achieved victory and attempt to engineer a close to the fighting. For now, that scenario appears to be little more than wishful thinking, sources say. If Russia is able to consolidate some of its gains in the east, US officials increasingly fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin may eventually be able to use that territory as a staging ground to push further into Ukraine. ""I am sure that if Ukraine is not strong enough, they will go further,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Tuesday in a bid to urge the West to send more weapons faster. ""We have shown to them our strength. And it is important for this strength to be also demonstrated together with us by our Western partners as well."" Western military aid, he said, ""has to come quicker"" if Ukraine's allies want to stymie Russia's territorial ambitions. Western officials broadly believe that Russia is in a more favorable position in the east, based solely on mass. Still, ""Russian progress is not a foregone conclusion,"" said one senior Biden administration official. As the front lines of the conflict have settled into a war of attrition built around back-and-forth artillery fire, both sides have suffered tremendous casualties and now face potential manpower shortfalls. Russia has also suffered losses of as much as a third of its ground force, and US intelligence officials have said publicly that Russia will struggle to make any serious gains without a full mobilization, a politically dangerous move that Putin has so far been unwilling to make. For now, the fighting is centered on two sister cities on opposite sides of the Seversky Donets River, Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Ukrainian fighters are almost completely encircled at Sievierodonetsk. Even though Western analysts believe Ukraine stands a better chance of defending Lysychansk, which sits on high ground, there are already troubling signs that Russian is attempting to cut off the city's supply lines by advancing from the southeast. ""In many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided"" around these two cities, Zelensky said last week. A preference for Soviet systems US officials insist that Western arms are still flowing to the front lines of the fight. But local reports of weapons shortages -- and frustrated pleas from Ukrainian officials on the front lines -- have raised questions about how effectively supply lines are running. Ukraine has begged not only for heavy artillery but also for even more basic supplies, like ammunition. Part of the problem, sources say, is that even as Ukraine is running out of old Soviet munitions that fit existing systems, there have also been obstacles to transitioning its fighters to Western, NATO-compliant systems. For one thing, training soldiers on these systems takes time -- and takes needed fighters away from the battlefield. In some cases, according to one source familiar with US intelligence, Ukraine is simply opting not to use the unfamiliar Western systems. For example, despite receiving hundreds of Switchblade drones, some units prefer to use commercial drones rigged with explosives that are more user-friendly. The Biden administration announced a new aid package earlier this month that included the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HiMARS, which is capable of launching a barrage of rockets and missiles and which Ukraine had urgently requested for weeks. But although a small group of Ukrainian soldiers began training on the system almost immediately after the package was announced, it requires three weeks of training and has not yet entered the fight. The senior defense official would say only that the system will enter Ukraine ""soon."" Meanwhile, there are a limited number of Soviet-era munitions still existing elsewhere in the world that can be sent to Ukraine. The US is urging nations with older stockpiles to figure out what they have available to give Ukraine, but the punishing artillery battle is ""wiping Soviet stuff off the face of the earth"" for Ukraine and the allies supplying it, according to a US official. Although the US has a clear picture of Russian battlefield losses, it has struggled from the beginning to assess Ukraine's fighting strength. Officials have acknowledged that the US doesn't have a clear picture of where Western arms go or how effectively they are used once they cross the border into Ukraine -- making intelligence predictions about the fighting difficult and policy decisions about how and when to resupply Ukraine equally tricky. The senior Biden administration official told CNN that the US is trying to ""better understand their [the Ukrainians'] consumption rate and operational pace,"" when asked specifically if Ukraine is running low on ammunition and weapons. ""It's hard to know,"" this person said. It's clear that Ukraine is heavily using the artillery the US and other Western nations have provided, because much of it moves in and out of the country for repairs. That blind spot is in part because Ukraine doesn't tell the West everything, Western officials say. And because the fighting is concentrated in such a small area relatively close to Russia, Western intelligence services don't have the same visibility that they do elsewhere. ""As you get down to the tactical level, especially in the location where the majority of the fighting is, it's further away from us, closer to Russia, and the forces are more densely packed in very, very close to each other,"" the senior NATO official said. ""So it's difficult to get a good granular picture of the status of fighting occasionally in the east."" It's also difficult to predict how Ukraine's military will perform in this pivotal moment because as casualties have mounted, hastily trained civilian volunteers are being sent into the fight, the NATO official added. Their performance under fire is an unknown quantity. ""It's one thing to have people available, but the question is, are they ready for the fight? I think you're going to see that as a factor,"" the official said. Predicting Putin's next move Meanwhile, US and other Western officials see no sign that Putin's commitment to prosecuting the costly war has diminished. ""In terms of the strategic aims that we judge Putin has vis-a-vis Ukraine, I don't see any signs that those have changed,"" the NATO official said. ""Putin still believes that eventually he will be successful and will either physically control or will gain a form of political control over Ukraine in either significant part or ideally in whole."" But even if Putin's commitment remains ironclad, there is a growing awareness that the West's might not be. As the fighting has dragged on, the cost to Western governments has continued to rise. Some Western governments -- including the United States -- have become concerned that the flow of donated weapons to Ukraine has depleted national stockpiles critical to their own defense. ""It's a valid concern"" for the United States, the senior administration official acknowledged. Then, of course, there is the sting of high energy prices and high inflation. As those costs begin to impact ordinary citizens, in the US and in Europe, and as media attention begins to drift from the day-to-day grind of the fighting, some officials fear Western support for Ukraine may wane. The spokesperson for the Ukrainian military's international legion on Monday derided a ""sense of complacency"" among Ukraine's military patrons, saying the country needs far more support if it is to defeat Russia's invasion. ""There's a certain sense of complacency that seems to have fallen over our Western partners that the arms deliveries that Ukraine has been already provided with are somehow enough to win the war,"" said Damien Magrou, spokesperson for the International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine, during a news conference. ""They are not! They do not come near anything that would be close to enabling us to defeat the Russians on the battlefield.""",14,2.0876750371374064,0.41258665352399143,1.675088383613415,12

Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is gaining ground in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, specifically in the city of Severodonetsk, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting recently. Without an influx of more weapons, some Ukrainian officials have said it will be increasingly difficult to halt Russia's incremental progress or reclaim occupied ground in the region. ""We hear what they're saying, we absolutely hear what they're saying,"" said the senior defense official, who spoke of the ""urgency"" of the Ukraine Contact Group meeting Thursday in Brussels. The official would not detail what countries would be announcing new security packages or what those shipments would include but noted that the US works ""very closely"" with allies to figure out what Ukraine's armed forces need and then find those systems to send over. The official would also not say whether the US would make a new announcement but said the Biden administration is already working on the next weapons package. ""It's a constant drumbeat because it's a constant battle"" with ""constantly evolving urgent requirements,"" the official told a group of reporters traveling with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The administration announced the last weapons package at the beginning of June, including High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HiMARS), a system capable of launching a barrage of rockets and missiles which Ukraine had urgently requested for weeks. The $700 million package was the first time the administration had drawn from last month's $40 billion aid package for Ukraine, which received bipartisan support in Congress. A small group of Ukrainian soldiers began training on HiMARS almost immediately after the weapons package was announced. But the system, which requires three weeks of training, has not yet entered the fight. The senior defense official would only say that it will enter Ukraine ""soon."" The US has taken on ""some risk"" to its own military readiness in sending weapons and equipment to Ukraine, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said earlier this month, but it was ""not an unacceptable level of risk at all."" The senior defense official said the US and it allies have a significant amount of equipment still available to send to Ukraine. ""We have far from exhausted the resource and the multi-country security assistance for this battle on Ukrainian territory,"" the official said. Zelensky asks for more Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky vowed in an evening speech on Monday that Ukraine would liberate all of the territories occupied by Russia, even the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed shortly after its takeover in 2014. But that could only happen, he said, if more weapons are sent to Ukraine. ""It only takes enough weapons to make it happen. The partners have it. In sufficient quantities. And we work every day for the political will to give us these weapons to appear,"" Zelensky said. Ukrainian officials have said 100 to 200 soldiers a day are dying in the fighting, a number that raises some doubts about the ability of the Ukrainian armed forces to sustain such losses. The US official said they don't doubt the casualty figures. ""The numbers are not out of line with what you would expect for this kind of artillery battle,"" the official said. ""It's not surprising that the numbers the Ukrainians are reporting are that serious."" But the official said the US has not seen a flagging of Ukrainian morale to remain in the fight, even as the conflict becomes a grinding, brutal battle of artillery that may favor the firepower and manpower of Russia's military. The official sounded a more optimistic note about the state of the war, even as Russia appears to be gaining momentum in the Donbas region. Problems of morale, poor command, and supply issues have plagued the Russian military since the beginning of the invasion. Russia was able to paper over some of those issues when the focus shifted to eastern Ukraine, since the battlefield bordered Russia, making it much easier to send supplies over the short distance to units on the front line. A lot of Russia's high-end equipment has already been destroyed, the official said, forcing them to rely on older models. At the same time, Russia's stock of precision munitions is dwindling, leading to the use of more artillery, which has had devastating consequences with its lack of precision. Sanctions and export restrictions have also made it higher to resupply their high-end capabilities, the official said. Despite all the challenges the Russians have faced -- both self-inflicted and as a result of Ukraine's counterattacks -- Moscow still retains its biggest advantage: the sheer size of its military. But that doesn't mean Russia is guaranteed victory, even if Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no indication that he is considering scaling back his goals.",14,0.4494917822858329,5.845730189694493,-5.39623840740866,12

""Firstly, our whole family is devastated and saddened at the outcome of the illegal show-trial by the so-called Donetsk People's Republic,"" Shaun Pinner's family said in a statement issued by the UK Foreign Office on Saturday. ""As a Ukrainian resident for over 4 years and contracted serving Marine in the 36th Brigade, of which he is very proud, Shaun should be accorded all the rights of a prisoner of war according to the Geneva Convention and including full independent legal representation,"" the statement said. ""We sincerely hope that all parties will co-operate urgently to ensure the safe release or exchange of Shaun. Our family including his son and Ukrainian wife, love and miss him so much and our hearts go out to all the families involved in this awful situation,"" the family also added. Pinner was sentenced to death on Thursday alongside compatriot Aiden Aslin and Moroccan national Brahim Saadoune, after they were accused of being ""mercenaries"" for Ukraine, according to Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti. DPR authorities said that the three men were foreign fighters who had been apprehended by Russian forces in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol in April. RIA Novosti said that Pinner, Aslin, and Saadoune will be shot. Russia is the only country that recognizes the DPR as being independent. The global community does not acknowledge the region and its institutions, and considers the region to be part of Ukraine. Independent watchdog groups have historically condemned the separatists for an egregious human rights track record and the maltreatment of prisoners. RIA Novosti quoted the ""head of the judicial board"" in Donetsk as saying the convicted men ""can appeal the decision within a month."" Pavel Kosovan, one of the lawyers for the defendants, said that his clients would appeal the verdict, Russian state media TASS reported after the death penalty was handed down.

Street fighting continued to rage on Saturday in the eastern city, where Russian soldiers and Ukrainian troops are still locked in battle. ""The situation remains difficult. Fighting continues, but unfortunately, most of the city is under Russian control. Some positional battles are taking place in the streets,"" said Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region, which makes up Donbas along with the neighboring Donetsk region. The most active areas of fighting were Severodonetsk, Popasna, and the area of the Siverskyi Donets river, Haidai said on national television Saturday, adding Russian forces were using ""highly destructive thermobaric rocket artillery."" ""Unfortunately, enemy artillery is simply dismantling floor-to-floor buildings that are used as shelters. In this sense, it is difficult because the enemy will be knocked out of one street, and then they will start dismantling neighborhoods house by house with tanks, artillery and grads,"" forcing Ukrainian forces in Severodonetsk to continuously move to new positions and regroup, the governor said. In his nightly address Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised Ukrainian forces in the region, saying he was ""proud of our defenders who could stop the advance of these hostile people, these occupiers, for many weeks and keep our defense strong."" Zelensky has said the fight for the strategic city may dictate the outcome of the war in the east of the country. ""Severodonetsk remains the epicenter of the confrontation in Donbas,"" Zelensky said earlier in the week. ""This is a very fierce battle, very difficult ... Probably one of the most difficult throughout this war,"" he added. ""In many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided there."" Severodonetsk lies in the heart of Donbas, a sprawling industrial region in eastern Ukraine that has seen intermittent fighting since 2014, when Russian-backed separatists seized control of two territories there -- the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. Haidai said Saturday Ukraine were still in control of the Azot chemical plant in Severodonetsk, where 800 people are reportedly sheltering, after a Russian-backed official claimed Ukrainian fighters were also trapped there. ""The story about the blockade of the Azot plant is a complete lie spread by Russian propagandists,"" Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. Rodion Miroshnik, a Russian-backed leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, claimed Saturday up to 400 Ukrainian fighters were taking refuge in the factory complex, hiding alongside civilians in bomb shelters, and negotiations for their surrender and the safe evacuation of civilians were ongoing. ""The combatants are trying to make demands, namely to allow them to leave the territory of the chemical plant together with the hostages and to provide a corridor to go to Lysychansk. Such demands are unacceptable and will not be taken into consideration,"" Miroshnik said. Death toll climbs in Mariupol Further south in Mariupol, an additional 24 deaths of children were reported by Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office on Saturday, following Russian shelling during a monthslong siege in the southern port city. The blockade ended last month after Russian forces took control of the Azovstal steel plant where Ukrainian forces had holed up. This brings the total death toll of minors during Russia's invasion of Ukraine to 287, the Prosecutor General's Office said in a Telegram post. More than 492 children have been injured during the war, according to the statement. The statement added the figures are not complete, as work is underway to verify the deaths of children in other places where there is active fighting. The office also said 1,971 educational institutions have been damaged by Russian bombardments, with 194 of them having been completely destroyed. On May 25, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, Petro Andrushchenko -- who has also moved to Ukrainian-held territory -- told CNN Mariupol town hall officials believe at least 22,000 residents of the city were killed during three months of war. The news comes as the city is battling a potential cholera outbreak, according to a British intelligence report published on Friday. Access to drinking water, internet connection and phone services are unreliable in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, the report said, reflecting concerns of Ukrainian officials as Russia scrambles to provide basic public services to civilian populations in areas it has occupied. In Saturday's nightly address, Zelensky said ""about 32,000"" Russian troops have been killed since the start of the invasion. Earlier Saturday, the Ukrainian military said total Russian combat losses since February 24 were ""about 32,050."" CNN cannot independently verify Ukraine's figures on the number of Russian forces killed in the conflict and the exact death toll remains unclear. 'Ukraine will definitely prevail' As Russian forces advance their control of key regions in Ukraine, and the number of civilian casualties rise, Zelensky has remained firm in his stance that Ukraine will overcome Russia's invasion. Speaking in a special virtual address to the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier defense conference, Zelensky said Ukraine will ""definitely prevail"" in its war against Russia. ""This is the confrontation between the possible, which we and many people in the world need, and the impossible, for which Russia is so desperately fighting for,"" Zelensky said. He added Russia regarded his country as its ""colony"" and was doing its utmost to make it impossible for Ukraine to ""exist freely and independently."" ""Russia wishes to make it impossible for our people to use their land, resources and water in their best interest. Russia wishes to steal it, and this active looting of the territory it has (managed) to occupy -- they are taking away literally everything,"" Zelensky added. ""It is on the battlefield in Ukraine that the future rules of this world are being decided along with the boundaries of the possible,"" Zelensky said. ""Let us save the whole world from coming back to the times when everything was decided based on the so-called right of might and when certain peoples and their ideas, and many nations, were of no consequence,"" Zelensky said. Ukraine's president also urged leaders to do whatever is needed to ""break the ability of Russia and any other country in the world to block seas and destroy freedom of navigation."" Zelensky warned failure to do so would result in an ""acute and severe food crisis and famine"" in many Asian and African countries. He added the Black Sea, through which Ukraine exported most of its foodstuffs before Russia's invasion, has become the most dangerous waterway in the world. Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. Before the war, wheat supplies from Russia and Ukraine accounted for almost 30% of global trade, and Ukraine was the world's fourth-largest exporter of corn and the fifth-largest exporter of wheat, according to the US State Department. The United Nations World Food Program -- which helps combat global food insecurity -- buys about half of its wheat from Ukraine each year and has warned of dire consequences if Ukrainian ports are not opened up.

2022-06-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/10/europe/ukraine-mariupol-potential-cholera-outbreak-intl/index.html,"Mariupol at risk of cholera outbreak as Russia struggles to provide basic services, says UK intelligence","Ukraine's southern city of Mariupol, now fully under Russian control, is at risk of a cholera outbreak, according to a British intelligence report published Friday, echoing concerns of Ukrainian officials as Russia struggles to provide basic public services to civilian populations in areas it has occupied. The report said that access to drinking water, internet connection and phone services remain inconsistent in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. The occupied city of Kherson ""likely faces a critical shortage of medicines,"" while the port city of Mariupol ""is at risk of a major cholera outbreak,"" the report says, adding that ""isolated cases of cholera have been reported since May."" Petro Andrushenko, an adviser to the elected Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol, warned on Tuesday of an increasingly dire situation in that city, which was ""being quietly closed"" by Russia due to the potential cholera outbreak amid deteriorating sanitary conditions. ""The occupiers seem to have realized that there is such a challenge,"" Andrushchenko said on national television. ""There are talks about quarantine. The city is being quietly closed."" Andrushchenko, who is not in the city but has been a reliable conduit of information from Mariupol, said that it was ""difficult to convey"" the bleak conditons of the once-thriving vacation spot by the Sea of Azov. ""The city has really turned into one with corpses everywhere,"" he said. ""They are piled. The occupiers cannot cope with burying them even in mass graves. There is not enough capacity even for this."" CNN cannot independently confirm Andrushchenko's claims. Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness that kills thousands of people worldwide each year. It is easily transmitted, by consuming food or water contaminated with the fecal bacteria Vibrio cholerae. ' A huge hazard' The World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed concerns about cholera in the city, saying it received ""information that there are swamps actually in the streets, and the sewage water and drinking water are getting mixed,"" Dr. Dorit Nitzan, the emergencies coordinator for WHO's European region, said on May 17 in Kyiv. During Nitzan's visit to Ukraine last month, she decribed Mariupol's hygienic situation as a ""a huge hazard."" Andrushchenko said natural water sources in the city are decreasing as the warmer months arrive. He said Russian evacuations from the city had stopped, and that leaving the city is no longer possible. ""You can enter the city with a residence permit in Mariupol. But this is a one-way ticket, because you cannot leave. ""Of all the possible scenarios to fight the epidemic, in our opinion, Russia has chosen, as always, the most cynical one -- just to close the people in the city and leave everything as it is: Whoever survives, survives,"" he said. The deputy mayor of Mariupol, Serhiy Orlov, who is also not in the city, said Tuesday that he believes around 150,000 people remain out of a pre-invasion population of more than 400,000, and a further 30,000 to 40,000 in surrounding suburbs. Orlov claimed that Russian had taken large amounts of medical equipment from Mariupol to the separatist city of Donetsk. Mariupol has witnessed some of the heaviest fighting of the invasion. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater. Before falling under Russian control, the city was a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as it sustained relentless attacks. Conditions deterioriated rapidly over the course of the war, with food and water dwindling in the city. The battle for the city ended in May when Russian forces ended the final holdout of Ukrainian resistance in the Azovstal steel plant. Ukraine last suffered a major cholera epidemic in 1995 and has experienced minor outbreaks since, ""especially around the Azov sea coast -- which includes Mariupol,"" according to the British intelligence report. ""Medical services in Mariupol are likely already near collapse: a major cholera outbreak in Mariupol will exacerbate this further.""",17,1.119272586054356,4.7164258803861285,-3.5971532943317728,1
2022-06-09,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/09/europe/foreigners-death-penalty-dpr-ukraine-russia-intl/index.html,Two Britons and a Moroccan sentenced to death by pro-Russian court in separatist part of Ukraine,"A court in the pro-Russian, self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) sentenced three foreigners to death on Thursday, after accusing them of being ""mercenaries"" for Ukraine, according to Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti. DPR authorities said the three -- British citizens Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan national Brahim Saadoune -- were foreign fighters who had been captured in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol by Russian forces in April. RIA Novosti said the three will be shot. Russia is the only country that considers the DPR independent. The international community does not recognize the region and its institutions, and considers the territory to be part of Ukraine. Independent watchdog groups have long accused the separatists of a dismal human-rights track record and ill-treatment of prisoners. The Ukrainian government said in a statement on Wednesday that it considers all foreign volunteers to be members of its armed forces and to be lawful combatants entitled to treatment as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. RIA Novosti quoted the ""head of the judicial board"" in Donetsk as saying the convicted men ""can appeal the decision within a month."" Pavel Kosovan, one of the lawyers for the defendants, said that his clients would appeal the verdict, Russian state media TASS reported after the death penalty was handed down. The UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the judgment had ""absolutely no legitimacy."" ""I utterly condemn the sentencing of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner held by Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine. They are prisoners of war. This is a sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy. My thoughts are with the families. We continue to do everything we can to support them,"" she said in a statement posted on Twitter. Pinner was previously a member of the UK Armed Forces, according to a statement released by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office in April. Several friends of Saadoune told CNN he initially came to Ukraine to study at a university and joined the Ukrainian armed forces in 2021. The family of Aslin said on Wednesday, after a propaganda video of him and the other two men appearing in court was released by the DPR, that it was working with the UK Foreign Office and Ukrainian government to get him home. In the statement, released through the UK Foreign Office to CNN on Wednesday, the family said Aslin was ""a ""much-loved man and very much missed."" CNN has also reached out to British and Moroccan authorities for comment.",13,7.7494840176312225,3.7664636483626284,3.983020369268594,6
2022-06-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/europe/ukraine-hunt-for-collaborators-intl/index.html,Traitor or hero? Ukraine finds it tough to identify Russian collaborators,"A reckoning is underway in Ukraine, with prosecutors building dozens of cases against Ukrainians accused of collaborating with Russian forces. The Interior Ministry says there are already more than 500 cases being investigated. From President Volodymyr Zelensky downwards, Ukrainian authorities have reserved special loathing for alleged collaborators, or Gauleiters as they are often dubbed. Gauleiters were district officials in Nazi Germany. Zelensky said in April that ""justice will be restored. Everyone who became a Gauleiter can register to live somewhere in Rostov-on-Don,"" in Russia. From Mariupol to Enerhodar, the Russians have been able to find Ukrainians ready to become local officials, though in many cases their competence has been questionable. Most of those accused of collaboration are still beyond the reach of Ukrainian prosecutors. But about 40 former officials and others have already faced trial under stringent laws enacted soon after the invasion. Some have been found guilty of providing military intelligence to the Russians. Prosecutions continue -- but not all cases are crystal clear. Local officials in areas overrun by Russian forces have frequently faced an unenviable choice: try to protect and represent the people who elected them -- or leave quickly. The southern region of Kherson has provided many examples of this dilemma. Chaos in Kherson In the early days of the invasion, Russian troops swept into Kherson. Many regional officials -- police, security service officers, politicians -- left swiftly. But Ilya Karamalikov, a city council member in Kherson, stayed. Now, he faces charges of treason. The six-page indictment, which CNN has obtained, alleges that Karamalikov ""performs actions aimed at harming the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability"" of Ukraine, ""by switching to the side of the aggressor country of the Russian Federation during martial law, and assisting its representatives in subversive activities against Ukraine."" His lawyer, Mikhail Velichko, strenuously denies the charges, and says Karamalikov is to be commended for staying at his post and trying to keep order in the city in the chaotic days after the invasion. ""All security forces and the regional administration were evacuated in advance. Kherson was abandoned,"" Velichko said. ""This not only led to the absence of Ukrainian authorities in the regional center, but also endangered the safety of the residents of Kherson, who were left to fend for themselves. ""Civilians cannot resist brute armed force,"" Velichko told CNN. ""Yes, many collaborate. And many simply refuse and wait for Kherson to be de-occupied. Many teachers, for example, refused to work. The mayor refused to work."" Nearly two months later, Karamalikov was arrested after crossing into Ukrainian-held territory, as he was bringing his family out of Kherson. He was held at the security services' building in Kryvyi Rih, and Velichko claims he suffered physical abuse and torture. CNN has requested a response to the claim from Ukrainian authorities. Karamalikov is still detained and has been accused of giving the occupation authorities confidential information, such as the personal data of Kherson law enforcement officers, politicians and activists. Velichko says this is ridiculous. ""The military registration and enlistment office had full lists: with addresses, with surnames, with telephones and positions of people. Lists of all employees of the territorial defense of the Kherson region. There are lists of military personnel, as well as civilians. All this was open,"" he said. Prosecutors also allege Karamalikov assisted in the evacuation of wounded Russian military personnel and helped them find food and rehabilitation. The municipal guard On February 25, the day after Russian troops rolled across the border, Karamalikov posted an appeal on Facebook for volunteers for a Municipal Guard to keep order and prevent looting, as well as organize humanitarian aid. One resident, who asked not to be identified, told CNN: ""They defended the city from marauders, every day they caught someone."" Indeed, the mayor of Kherson Igor Kolykhaiev, who also remained behind, said on March 20: ""There is no police, no prosecutor's office, no judicial system left in the city....There are looters in the city, there are attempts to fight them. The Municipal Guard protects Kherson around the clock against looting."" Karamalikov himself posted on Facebook: ""The 'Municipal Guard' of Kherson -- the only power authority in the city today. Tasks: patrolling the streets of the city, fighting looters, illegal trade, street and domestic violence."" Velichko says his client inevitably had to deal with the new authorities. One of Karamalikov's calls, intercepted by the Ukrainian security services, illustrated his awkward position. Volunteers had detained a Russian deserter, according to his lawyer. Holding him while Kherson was under occupation could have brought harsh retribution, so Karamalikov decided to hand him back and established contact with Russian forces. Rejecting claims that he was on good terms with the Russians, one associate said that premises in Kherson city owned by Karamalikov had been searched by Russian forces on March 24. Two weeks later, pro-Russian Telegram channels claimed the ""Municipal Guard"" in Kherson was engaged in looting and accused both Kolykhaiev and Karamalikov of covering up racketeering. Karamalikov decided to get his family out of Kherson. When he did -- on April 14 -- he was detained by Ukrainian police at a checkpoint. According to documents reviewed by CNN, the case against Karamalikov has relied largely on the account of a senior officer in the security services who had left Kherson before the Russians arrived and who was subsequently dismissed by presidential decree. Some regional officials say they have received little guidance from Kyiv about how to deal with the occupation. The mayor of Kherson city, Ihor Kolykhaev, said: ""We continue to work remotely with the City Council specialists, deputies, and we are still waiting for a response from the President's Office."" Kolykhaev is still in the region but has been ousted from his post. Traitor or hero? Marina Peschanenko, who knows Karamalikov well, believes he has been unfairly accused. ""Ilya, together with mayor Ihor Kolykhaiev, did everything to ensure that the city functioned. And this was without support from the Kyiv government,"" she said. In such desperate moments, she said, there are few good options. ""Act at your own discretion, choose the solutions that you consider the best for the city. And in this extreme situation, any decisions are correct,"" she said. Petro Andrushenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, echoes that thought. ""It is important to remember that working for the occupiers in the humanitarian sphere is not essentially a collaboration,"" he said last month, soon after the separatist, self-declared Donetsk People's Republic took over administration of the city. ""There will be retribution, but only for real collaborators."" But it's unclear that the security services and prosecutors will see the situation in the same light, and that worries some who are struggling to provide essential services in Russian-occupied areas. CNN spoke with a senior official in a state-run pharmacy chain in Melitopol, also in the south, who has cooperated with the Russians. ""Do we need to close all the pharmacies and run away?"" this person asked CNN. ""Leave residents in the occupation without medical care and without medicines? What solution does the government offer us?"" This person asked not to be identified for their own safety but added: ""There is a shortage of drugs in the city, but the closure of the pharmacy network will lead to even fewer of them. There is no right decision, any choice will be bad. If you stay, you are a collaborator. If you leave, then you abandoned your citizens without medical assistance."" Among other professions affected are teachers in occupied areas. Deputy Justice Minister Valeria Kolomiets told news agency Ukrinform that ""educators are responsible for their actions - and if they start to conduct propaganda in educational institutions, saying for example that there is no occupation, then they are breaking the law."" In Kherson, teachers have been put under great pressure to teach a new ""Russian"" curriculum. Some were threatened in April, according to local activists, with a blunt message: ""Either give us the keys and documents, or we'll send you 'to rest' in the basement."" Others have been sent to Russian-occupied Crimea to be taught the Russian curriculum, according to Ukrainian officials. There is also evidence in Kherson that those detained have been coerced into signing a ""condemnation of the Ukrainian regime"" and applying for a Russian passport, according to Kherson deputy Serhii Khlan, as well as people who talked to CNN after fleeing the region. Such examples show that it's often hard to distinguish between who is actively collaborating, and who is trying to navigate a risky and unpredictable existence. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk recognizes the dilemma, but the government is not ceding ground. ""Do not take a Russian passport,"" she said at the end of last month. ""I know it may not be easy, but in the long run, Russian citizenship will create more problems for you than benefits."" In Kryvih Rih, one of the most prominent trials for collaboration -- that of Kherson city council member Karamalikov -- is set to begin in the coming days. Velichko, his attorney, is sure that his client will be vindicated, despite the raft of charges against him. ""Traitor? Or hero of Ukraine?"" he asked. ""For me as his lawyer and for many concerned residents of Kherson the answer is obvious: Ilya Karamalikov is a hero.""",14,4.61533118802377,5.3113519685354005,-0.6960207805116303,18
2022-06-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/04/politics/national-guard-ukrainian-forces/index.html,Bond between Americans and Ukrainian forces they trained remains strong as war grinds on,"The war in Ukraine became real for Col. Robert Swertfager on day one. A fighter pilot with the California Air National Guard, Swertfager has, by his count, 73 Ukraine entry stamps in his passport over 20 years, the result of a partnership between ""The Golden State"" and Ukraine that has created relationships both personal and professional. ""We have had official conversations on a regular basis,"" Swertfager told CNN, ""but daily communications as friends, partners and brothers."" Swertfager and the other members of the 144th Fighter Wing are close to many pilots in the Ukrainian Air Force, exchanging phone calls, text messages and more every day since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. It's how Swertfager found out so quickly about the death of Col. Oleksandr Oksanchenko on the first day of the war. The two had played a major role in planning the 2011 Safe Skies exercise in Ukraine and had grown close over years of shared training. ""It was no longer just a war that you're seeing on the television,"" Swertfager said, ""but it's hitting home because we just lost a very good friend."" The relationship between a US state and a foreign nation exists under the National Guard Bureau's State Partnership Program, where each state will communicate and train with one or more countries as a designated partner. California began its program with Ukraine in 1993, shortly after the country gained its independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In that time, Ukraine has gone from a fledgling military dependent upon Soviet-era equipment and tactics to a fighting force that has shown itself capable of challenging one of the largest militaries in the world, despite being outmanned and outgunned. Even though no American troops are on the ground in Ukraine, the strong bonds formed are having a practical impact as Ukraine's military attempts to resist Russia's attempts to conquer the country. Daily contact Members of the California National Guard have been in daily contact with their Ukrainian counterparts at all different levels, said Maj. Gen. David Baldwin, the commander of the State Military Department, which includes the Army and Air National Guard. About once a week, Baldwin has a video call with the most senior leaders of the Ukrainian military, he said at a roundtable with reporters about the State Partnership Program which manages relationships between units and foreign nations. But every day he exchanges text messages and has one-on-one phone calls about ""the overall situation."" At the staff level, the Guard's brigadier generals and colonels work with the Ukrainian defense attache and Ukrainian leaders to refine their requests for weapon systems, Baldwin said. Early in the conflict, these conversations focused on what requests the US was likely to fulfill and what systems may be seen as too offensive in nature. But they have shifted to larger and more powerful systems as the Biden administration has shown its willingness to send in artillery first and now multiple-launch rocket systems. ""The current one that we're working through is what's the right fighter aircraft for them,"" Baldwin said. California Guard leaders are pushing the Ukrainian Air Force to stick with Soviet-era MiGs for now because of their familiarity with the fighter jets, but Baldwin said Ukraine is looking beyond the immediate timeframe to a year out and beyond. ""What's in the realm of possibility of systems that will be effective, available and affordable for them?,"" Baldwin asked. ""The Ukrainians are very quick on the uptake when we train them on Western systems."" At the tactical level, other Guard members are in touch with their Ukrainian colleagues ""on a daily basis"" on ""tactics, tips, and procedures,"" Baldwin said. Ukrainian soldiers will regularly also share anecdotes, photos, videos, maps and more with the California Guard members to whom they've grown close, providing an unfiltered look at the minutiae of the ongoing conflict. Those fragments of potentially valuable information are collected and consolidated in a daily call, Baldwin said, and passed on to the active-duty military. The California National Guard takes part in a daily video call with the Joint Staff at the Pentagon and US European Command. ""Often, the Ukrainians will share information with us that they don't share through more formal channels because we have these personal relationships,"" Baldwin said. Although California is the state partner of Ukraine, other state National Guard units have gone to Ukraine to train their military as part of the Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine (JMTG-U), a mission established following Russia's invasion and annexation of occupied Crimea in 2014. Most recently, units from the Florida and Washington National Guard went to train the Ukrainians as part of this mission, building their own relationships. 'A desperate plea' from the front line In one instance, a Washington National Guard member was sitting at home a few weeks ago when his phone rang, Baldwin recounted and a spokeswoman for the Washington Guard confirmed. On the other end was a Ukrainian soldier with a ""desperate plea"" for help for his friend. The Ukrainian experienced a misfire of his Javelin, an anti-tank missile that has proven devastatingly effective against Russia's armored vehicles. But this one wasn't working. The Washington Guardsmen coached the Ukrainian through the misfire procedures, allowing him to fire on the Russian tank. Without that phone call - and the relationship behind it - the Ukrainian soldier would not have been able to defeat the tank, Baldwin said. The Florida National Guard was the latest unit to take part in the training group leaving Ukraine about one week before Russia's invasion began in late-February. They returned to Europe two months later to resume training Ukrainian forces in places like Germany. ""There were some pretty emotional hugs and reunions"" when they reunited with their ""Ukrainian brethren,"" said Maj. Gen. James Eifert, the commander of the Florida National Guard. ""They are constantly reminded of the seriousness of their endeavor and the importance of the training that they're giving."" The process of learning and improving work both ways. As Ukrainian soldiers and pilots learn tactics and tips from their National Guard counterparts, the Guard members are taking their own notes. ""They are a hybrid of their former (Soviet) doctrine and Western doctrine, which I think is a key contributor to their success right now,"" said Swertfager. Members of the California Air National Guard, he says, are in touch with each of the Ukrainian squadrons and all of their different fighter aircraft. The Ukrainian pilots share their experiences and give the US pilots informal debriefs ""on a regular basis,"" Swertfager said. ""We're taking copious notes and learning quite a bit."" Baldwin, the commander of the California Guard, points to this relationship as perhaps the most important bond between the National Guard and Ukrainian Air Force. ""That relationship of all of them has proven to be about the most effective,"" Baldwin said, ""because of the tremendous performance of the outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian Air Force."" It's a compliment Swertfager refuses to accept, insisting that no one in California can take credit or wants to take credit for how Ukraine's pilots have performed. ""All of us in California are extremely proud of our partnership and our relationship with Ukraine's Air Force,"" Swertfager told CNN. ""That ... doesn't go away because world conflicts start. They just seem to be growing a lot stronger.""",14,5.260046650158346,0.9860310531388402,4.274015597019505,13
2022-06-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/europe/putin-ukraine-invasion-100-days-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html,"After 100 days of war, Putin is counting on the world's indifference","Rewind the clock to February 23, the day before Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine, and one might be tempted to guess that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's days in office were numbered. After all, Russia's military outspent that of Ukraine by roughly ten to one. Moscow enjoyed a twofold advantage over Kyiv in land forces; and the nuclear-armed power had ten times the aircraft and five times the armored fighting vehicles of its neighbor. A visibly angry Russian President Vladimir Putin had appeared on television just days before, delivering a rambling historical monologue that made clear he expected nothing less than regime change in Kyiv. The Kremlin leader seemed to be gambling that Zelensky would flee his capital, much as the US-backed president of Afghanistan had left Kabul just a few months earlier, and that Western outrage would subside, albeit with the temporary pain of new sanctions. 100 days later, whatever plans Putin may have had for a victory parade in Kyiv are on indefinite hold. Ukrainian morale did not collapse. Ukrainian troops, equipped with modern anti-tank weaponry delivered by the US and its allies, devastated Russian armored columns; Ukrainian missiles sank the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the pride of Russia's Black Sea Fleet; and Ukrainian aircraft stayed in the air, against the odds. In late March, Russia's military began withdrawing its battered troops from around the Ukrainian capital, claiming they had shifted focus to capturing country's eastern Donbas region. Three months after its invasion, Russia no longer appears to be aiming for a short, victorious war in Ukraine -- nor does it seem to be capable of achieving one. The problem with prognostication Does this mean Russia is losing? It's tempting to take a snapshot of the situation on a given day and draw sweeping conclusions. The Ukrainians have managed to kill Russian generals at an astonishing pace; Moscow has been forced to reorganize its military command after initial disarray; and Russian casualties, however elusive the official numbers, are shockingly high. But Russia now controls a crescent of Ukrainian territory that extends from around Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, continues through separatist-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk and reaches westward to Kherson, forming a land bridge linking the peninsula of Crimea (forcibly annexed by Russia in 2014) with the Donbas region. Russia's main direction of effort is now in the Donbas region, where things have settled into a grinding war of attrition. Recent fighting has focused around Severodonetsk, an industrial city where Ukrainian forces hold the last sliver of eastern Luhansk region. Ukrainian troops have ceded most of Severodonetsk to the Russians. The fall of the city will be a symbolic loss, but one that military analysts say spares the Ukrainian forces there from a protracted -- and likely losing -- siege. ""Kyiv could have committed more reserves and resources to the defense of Severodonetsk, and its failure to do so has drawn criticism,"" the US-based Institute for the Study of War said in a recent analysis. ""Both the decision to avoid committing more resources to saving Severodonetsk and the decision to withdraw from it were strategically sound, however painful. Ukraine must husband its more limited resources and focus on regaining critical terrain rather than on defending ground whose control will not determine the outcome of the war or the conditions for the renewal of war."" Amid the offensive on Severodonetsk, Oleksandr Motuzianyk, the Ukrainian defense ministry's spokesperson, said Russian forces were now ""trying encircle our troops in Donetsk and Luhansk regions,"" and regrouping to launch an offensive in the directions of Sloviansk, a strategic city that may be shaping up as the focus of the next pivotal battle. The battles in Ukraine's east are being fought in much more open terrain than the more densely-packed urban environment around Kyiv. That explains the urgency with which Ukrainians have requested heavier weaponry -- particularly artillery systems that can strike targets at longer ranges -- from the US and its allies. President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that the US will be sending more advanced rocket systems, including the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems with munitions that can launch rockets around 49 miles, a range far greater than anything Ukraine has been sent to date. That's welcome news for Kyiv, but Russia's offensive in the east is playing out as international media attention on Ukraine recedes somewhat from the headlines. And that may be what Putin is counting on, perhaps mindful that high energy costs and rising consumer prices -- both of which have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine -- are more likely to concentrate public opinion (and drive election outcomes) in the United States and elsewhere. Putin may also be counting on short diplomatic attention spans. This is the same Russian leader who doubled down on his support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2015 after Damascus suffered a string of defeats. That war -- now entering its 12th year -- has continued even as the world's attention has shifted to Ukraine. In that respect, Zelensky has been one of Ukraine's biggest assets in the information war. He has made a string of virtual appearances before parliaments around the globe, while reminding other world leaders who might be inclined to placate Putin by pushing for Ukraine to cede territory that it is the Ukrainian people, not he, who must decide outcomes. In Zelensky's appearances with wounded Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, the Ukrainian leader takes selfies and projects a warm, humane and self-effacing leadership style. That contrasts with the Russian leader's lone public visit to a military hospital: Putin, in an oversized white laboratory coat, met with wounded soldiers and officers who stood stiffly at attention before their commander-in-chief. But Putin, who has ended all domestic political opposition and effectively controls his country's airwaves, does not face the same domestic pressure as Zelensky. Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Putin's Security Council, said in recent remarks that Russian forces aren't ""chasing deadlines"" in Ukraine, suggesting Putin has a much more open-ended timeline for his war in Ukraine. Ukrainians, in contrast, fear international fatigue may set in, leading the international community to press their government to make concessions to Putin. ""You have the watches, but we have the time."" That saying, sometimes attributed to a captured Taliban fighter, summed up America's dilemma in fighting the Afghanistan war, a grudging acknowledgement that insurgencies operated on different political horizons and timelines, and that insurgents needed only to outlast -- not defeat -- the technologically superior US military. To repurpose that phrase, the deciding factor in Ukraine may be who has the time: A Russian dictator who is likely to hold power until he dies, or a Ukrainian people who are fighting for their national survival.",14,0.8813492931387183,5.522031628347507,-4.640682335208789,21
2022-06-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/politics/us-hackers-ukraine-support/index.html,US confirms military hackers have conducted cyber operations in support of Ukraine,"Cyber Command, the US military's hacking unit, has conducted offensive cyber operations in support of Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia's invasion, the head of the command has confirmed. The disclosure underscores how important projecting power in cyberspace -- in support of Ukraine's defenses and to potentially deter Russia from conducting cyberattacks against US infrastructure -- has been to the Biden administration as it continues to avoid directly engaging Russia in a shooting war. ""We've conducted a series of operations across the full spectrum; offensive, defensive, [and] information operations,"" General Paul Nakasone said in an interview with Sky News. A spokesperson for the command did not dispute the accuracy of the article but declined to elaborate on what the command's operations in Ukraine have entailed. It's a rare public acknowledgment from US military officials of hacking operations that are often shrouded in mystery. Nakasone's comments, and the White House's response to them, suggest that cyberspace is a domain in which the Biden administration feels comfortable countering Russia without fear of escalation. President Joe Biden has pledged not to engage directly with Russia militarily during the Ukraine war so long as the US and its allies aren't attacked. ""We don't see it as such,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday when asked at a news conference whether Cyber Command's actions contradicted Biden's pledge. Officials from Biden on down have for months warned about the threat of retaliatory Russian cyberattacks against US infrastructure after the US and its allies imposed sweeping sanctions on the Kremlin over its war in Ukraine. While analysts have proffered a range of theories, including improvements in US defenses, for why such a hack hasn't apparently happened yet, US officials tell CNN that Russian fear of escalation in cyberspace could be one factor. For one, Moscow may not want to risk retaliatory US cyberattacks that could hinder Russian military operations, a senior US defense intelligence official told CNN. The Russians have already had enough problems in Ukraine executing military operations, ""I think that adding any kind of potential for US cyber into that mix ... [is] probably factoring into their decision calculus,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about a sensitive national security issue. The paucity of Russian hacking on US targets may reflect the ""fear of escalation and what the US response might be, particularly if the US response affects Russian combat power in some form or fashion,"" the official added. The statements, from an interview with a senior official tasked with keeping a close eye on Russian cyber activity, offer a window into US thinking on Russian hacking at a critical time in the war -- as the Kremlin targets eastern Ukraine after failing to take Kyiv. The official's analysis also reflects the uncertainty and ambiguity of big-power competition in cyberspace, where governments try to keep each other guessing on their hacking capabilities and willingness to use them. ""For Russia, understanding the full scope of US cyber combat power is a gap for them which leaves them unsure about opening this front, at least at this time,"" the senior US official said. ""Cyber warfare is a new domain ... It hasn't been around long enough for any one nation-state to dominate it."" 'Attribution in peacetime is tricky enough' Analysts say Cyber Command has matured considerably since its inception more than a decade ago and has increasingly become a tool of US power projection. The command sent personnel to Ukraine in December, in anticipation of the Russian invasion, to help Kyiv bolster its cyber defenses and to gather information about potential Russian hacking threats, officials have said. There are a range of activities, including low-level intrusions into computer networks, that may qualify as ""offensive"" cyber operations but which the Russians may not necessarily interpret as escalatory, according to Bobby Chesney, an associate dean at the University of Texas School of Law who focuses on cyber and national security law. Some of the command's previous hacking operations have included knocking a Russian troll farm offline during 2018 US midterm elections, according to a Washington Post report, and targeting ransomware operatives who threaten US organizations. While big hacks of US organizations related to the Ukraine war have been in short supply, a plethora of attempted cyberattacks have been reported in Ukraine and Russia as digital vigilantes take sides in the war. The websites of Russian government ministries and media mouthpieces have been knocked offline or altered to broadcast anti-war slogans. The senior US defense intelligence official expressed concern that the Russian government may mistakenly assess that that type of hacking is coming from the US government. ""Attribution in peacetime is tricky enough ... I would say there's a real danger of unintentionally attributing something to the United States that the United States or its allies simply did not do,"" the official said.",3,4.451050934578972,1.42601768660609,3.025033247972882,23
2022-06-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/politics/fbi-blames-iran-hospital-cyberattack/index.html,FBI director blames Iran for 'despicable' attempted cyberattack on Boston Children's Hospital,"Iranian government-backed hackers were behind an attempted hack of the Boston Children's Hospital computer network last year, FBI Director Christopher Wray alleged Wednesday, calling it ""one of the most despicable cyberattacks I've ever seen."" The FBI was able to help thwart the hackers before they did damage to the hospital's computer network, according to Wray, but he cited it as an example of the potential high-impact hacking threats that the US faces from the governments of Iran, Russia, China and North Korea. ""We cannot let up on China or Iran or criminal syndicates while we're focused on Russia,"" Wray said in a speech at Boston College. The hack, which took place in June 2021, saw the attackers exploit popular software made by California-based firm Fortinet to control the hospital's computer network, according to US officials. Boston Children's Hospital is a more than 400-bed facility and is considered one of the premier pediatric centers in the US. The FBI got a tip about the Iranian hackers from a ""valued partner within the intelligence community,"" and the activity was thwarted before it was clear what the hackers' end goal on the hospital's network was, according to Joseph Bonavolonta, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston Field Office. ""There was no ransomware deployed,"" Bonavolonta told reporters Wednesday, ""and we were able to work with [the hospital] ahead of time to mitigate any of the other potential associated threats to the network."" Wray had previously said in March that the Iranian government-linked hackers were behind a cyberattack on a children's hospital, but he didn't name the hospital. ""Thanks to the FBI and our Boston Children's Hospital staff working so closely together, we proactively thwarted the threat to our network,"" Kristen Dattoli, a spokesperson for the hospital, said in a statement. Shahrokh Nazemi, a spokesperson for Iran's Permanent Mission to the United Nations, called the FBI claim a ""baseless allegation"" and ""an example of psychological warfare against Iran and thus of no value."" Ransomware and other hacking threats have stalked the health care system for years — and appear to have gotten worse during the coronavirus pandemic. There were 134 publicly reported ransomware incidents involving health care organizations in 2021, up from 106 incidents in 2020, according to threat-intelligence firm Recorded Future. The Boston Children's Hospital incident was one of several that prompted a public warning last November from the FBI and other agencies that Iranian government-backed hackers were targeting a range of organizations across the transportation and health care sectors. The advisory was a rare case of the US government publicly linking Iran with ransomware, which is typically used by cybercriminals rather than governments. But US officials and private analysts have long warned of collusion between foreign governments and criminal hacking groups. When it comes to potential Russian hacking threats to the US, the FBI has been on a ""combat tempo,"" with a 24/7 command post, during the Kremlin's war in Ukraine, Wray added. ""We've seen the Russian government taking specific preparatory steps towards potential destructive [cyber]attacks, both here and abroad,"" he added. Such a ""destructive"" hack — in which data or systems are destroyed — hasn't been reported in the US since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But suspected Russian hackers have conducted a slew of destructive hacks in Ukraine, and US officials are warning businesses to not let their guard down. The same network access gained by Russian operatives to collect intelligence could be used for a destructive hack, Wray warned. ""That's why, when it comes to Russia today, we're focused on acting as early -- as far 'left of boom,' as they say -- as we can."" ""We're watching for their cyber activities to become more destructive as the war keeps going poorly for them,"" Wray said Wednesday.

2022-05-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/finland-foreign-minister-interview-dc/index.html,Finnish foreign minister optimistic that 'sooner or later' Finland and Sweden will be NATO members,"Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto expressed optimism that ""sooner or later, Finland and Sweden will be members of NATO"" and said discussions with the Turkish government would continue as Ankara threatens to block the two nations from joining the defensive alliance. In an interview with CNN in Washington, DC, Friday, Haavisto said he expected that the topic of Finland's NATO membership and overcoming Turkey's current opposition would come up in his conversations with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in his meeting later in the day, adding he was ""quite confident"" that other NATO countries had spoken with Turkey as well. At a press conference following the meeting between the top US and Finnish diplomats, Blinken said the US is engaged directly with Turkey ""but the focus is on the work that Finland, Sweden and Turkey are doing together to address the concerns."" ""I'm not going to get into the specifics, but there's an ongoing, very active conversation between Finland, Sweden, and Turkey that we'll support in any way that we can. I suspect that NATO will do will do so as well,"" the top US diplomat said. Delegations from Finland and Sweden -- which both formally applied for NATO membership last week -- traveled to Turkey earlier this week for talks on NATO accession. All current NATO members must approve new members. Haavisto, who did not attend the talks, called it a ""good meeting,"" and said it lasted for five hours. Haavisto indicated that there are European and Finnish laws and policies in place that guide Finland's actions on Turkey's main demands -- the designation the PKK as a terrorist organization, lifting arms export controls, the extradition of Kurdish militants that Turkey sees as terrorists. However, Turkish presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin said following the delegation's visit that ""if Turkey's security concerns are not met with concrete steps, the process cannot progress."" Haavisto said ""there was an agreement to continue those discussions,"" but a next round of talks has not yet been arranged. ""From our perspective, the time frame is essential, because we are, of course, looking forward to NATO Summit in Madrid,"" which is at the end of June, ""and we hope that during the NATO Summit, the new members would be welcomed, at least, and the NATO 'Open Door Policy' would be confirmed, but of course, this is up to each and every member state that they can also influence the process,"" he said. The decisions by Finland and Sweden to apply for NATO was a major shift prompted by Russia's war in Ukraine. Although Moscow suggested it would take ""retaliatory steps"" in response, Haavisto told CNN they have not seen any incidents thus far, reiterating ""we don't expect anything but we are prepared for everything."" He said Finland is pleased made by the statements countries regarding security commitments in the current gray zone between their NATO application and accession. 'Out of the question' to ease sanctions on Russia to unblock Ukraine's ports Haavisto said he expected that the issues of energy and food security would also come up in his meeting with Blinken Friday. ""Our concern is also the blockade of the sea transport on the coast of the Black Sea, because this is linked to the grain transport and grain trade and so forth. And it's not good if Ukraine is a landlocked country like it is now,"" he told CNN. The foreign minister said it was ""out of the question"" to ease Russian sanctions as a means to unblock the ports. ""I think the international community should really appeal to have a safe route of transport for the agricultural products out of Ukraine, because this is critical to the food safety and food prices globally,"" he told CNN. Haavisto said it was difficult to predict how the war in Ukraine, which is now in its fourth month, might end, but said that Finland and Europe are focused on ""helping Ukraine as much as possible so that whenever some talks will occur, they will negotiate from the strongest possible position."" ""It's very difficult to see when there will be business as usual between Russia and Europe,"" he added, noting that Russia must be investigated for the human rights abuses and war crime it has committed in Ukraine. Asked if there can be business as usual if Putin remains in power, Haavisto said it was ""difficult to say."" ""There are those who say that without regime change, you cannot do anything, but also regime change is something that you cannot do from outside, it's, of course, something that Russia and Russians can only do,"" he said. Haavisto also noted ""we have to be prepared also for more risky scenarios, that when people speak about the regime changes, you do not know if the regime changes for the better or for the worse,"" such as a military takeover. ""And of course, it's a country with nuclear weapons and chemical weapons and so forth,"" he added, saying it was the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis that the use of tactical nuclear weapons had been hinted. He said in Finland that ""creates a lot of concerns."" ""We have a strong traditional army and strong traditional military but with these type of threats, you cannot survive alone against that type of threat,"" he said.",29,3.4418808788004793,4.308057396282244,-0.8661765174817648,20
2022-05-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/europe/russia-ukraine-genocide-warning-intl/index.html,Exclusive: Leading experts accuse Russia of inciting genocide in Ukraine and intending to 'destroy' Ukrainian people,"Russia's actions in Ukraine provide enough evidence to conclude that Moscow is inciting genocide and committing atrocities intended to destroy the Ukrainian people, according to the first independent report into allegations of genocide in that country. The legal report, signed by more than 30 leading legal scholars and genocide experts, accuses the Russian state of violating several articles of the United Nations Genocide Convention. It warns there is a serious and imminent risk of genocide in Ukraine, backing the accusations with a long list of evidence including examples of mass killings of civilians, forced deportations and dehumanizing anti-Ukrainian rhetoric used by top Russian officials. The report was put together by New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, a US-based think tank, and the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights which is based in Canada, and is set to release on Friday, with the authors sending copies to parliaments, governments and international organizations around the world. An advance copy of the report has been shared exclusively with CNN. ""We assembled top legal experts from around the globe who then examined all the evidence and they came to the conclusion that the Russian Federation bears responsibility for breaches of the Genocide Convention in Ukraine,"" Azeem Ibrahim of the New Lines Institute told CNN. Ibrahim visited Ukraine in March to gather evidence for the report. ""This is a very thorough and detailed examination of extensive evidence,"" he said. ""What we have seen so far is that this war is genocidal in its nature, in terms of the language being used and the manner in which it is being executed. That's very, very clear."" Under the UN Genocide Convention, its signatories have a legal obligation to prevent genocide -- and the report is urging the international community to act. ""We have no time at all, we believe that there is a very serious risk of genocide,"" Ibrahim said. ""Every country that is a signatory to the Genocide Convention, and that's 151 countries including the Russian Federation, every country has to do whatever it can to put a stop to this, otherwise they will also be in breach of the convention."" In one of the most chilling parts of the report, the group makes a direct comparison with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, urging the world to act before it's too late: ""The details of the mass murder of over 7,000 Bosnian Muslim boys and men in Srebrenica only emerged before the international community when it was too late to prevent a genocide that occurred in a matter of days. In 2022, we have the capabilities to accurately track similar atrocities as they unfold and respond accordingly."" The report points finger directly at Moscow, accusing Russia's top officials of orchestrating incitement to genocide and laying the groundwork for future genocide by repeatedly denying the existence of a Ukrainian identity. The Kremlin has forcefully disagreed with President Joe Biden's statement in April that he considered Russia's actions in Ukraine a ""genocide."" The New Lines and Raoul Wallenberg Centre report says the Russian state is breaching Article II and Article III (c) of the Genocide Convention. Article II of the convention states genocide is an attempt to commit acts ""with an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" Article III (c) concerns the ""direct and public incitement to commit genocide."" As examples of the evidence that Russia is breaching the convention, the experts highlight repeated statements made by Russia's President Vladimir Putin who has made it clear he believes Ukraine has no right to exist as an independent state. They also point to the dehumanizing language used by top Russian officials to describe Ukrainians -- including worlds like ""bestial,"" ""subordinate"" and ""filth"" -- as well as their portrayal of Ukraine as a ""Nazi state"" and an ""existential threat"" to Russia. But the report goes further than alleging Russia is intending to commit genocide, accusing Russian forces of carrying out a ""pattern of consistent and pervasive atrocities against Ukrainian civilians collectively"" in the course of the invasion. It says that the well-documented massacres and summary executions in Bucha, Staryi Bykiv, and in Sumy and Chernihiv regions, Russia's deliberate attacks on shelters, evacuation routes and healthcare facilities, as well the indiscriminate targeting and bombardment of residential areas, rapes, sieges, grain thefts and forced deportations to Russia all amount to ""genocidal pattern of destruction."" CNN has independently confirmed many of the atrocities mentioned in the report. The New Lines Institute and Raoul Wallenberg Centre have previously investigated the Rohingya and Uyghur genocides in Myanmar and China respectively, and produced the first report that determined that China's actions in Xinjiang constituted genocide under the Genocide Convention. The team of authors includes David Scheffer, who played a pivotal role in talks establishing the International Criminal Court as the first ever US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues. Canada's former ambassador to the UN Allan Rock and Charles Taku, the lead counsel at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and Special Court for Sierra Leone were also involved. Apart from legal scholars and genocide experts, the team assembled by New Lines Institute also includes open source intelligence investigators, and linguists who examined a communications intercepts and testimonials.",13,3.259234814611111,6.377808914805534,-3.118574100194423,5
2022-05-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/26/politics/new-jersey-somerset-county-ransomware-attack/index.html,Ransomware attack hits New Jersey county,"A ransomware attack has forced officials in a 345,000-person New Jersey county to switch off their computers and set up temporary Gmail accounts so the public can email key agencies such as the health, emergency and sheriff's departments. The hacking incident in central New Jersey's Somerset County, which began Tuesday, has disrupted services that rely on the county's databases, including accessing land and probate records, the county said in a statement. The ransomware attack has only affected email and IT systems; phone lines and emergency service systems are all working properly, the county said. The hack also affected a web form through which residents can request replacement mail-in ballots for New Jersey's primary election next month. Residents can still call to request a replacement ballot or do so in-person, Nathan Rudy, Somerset County's director of public information, told CNN. Rudy said it would be ""at least until the end of the week"" before the county's digital infrastructure would be fully functional after the hack. It was unclear who was responsible for the hack. Rudy said the FBI was investigating the incident. CNN has requested comment from the FBI. The Somerset County hack is only the latest ransomware incident to hamper local government services in the US, which often struggle with resources to counter hacks. It marks the 22nd US state or local government to be hit by ransomware in 2022, according to Allan Liska, senior intelligence analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future In his first year in office, President Joe Biden exhorted Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in cybercriminals operating from Russian soil, some of whom had allegedly conducted high-profile hacks of US critical infrastructure. While Russian authorities in January detained someone that US officials believe was responsible for the 2021 ransomware attack on US fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline, any bilateral progress on the issue appears to have stalled after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. With many alleged ransomware operatives living in Ukraine and Russia, the jury is still out on how the war in Ukraine has affected the ransomware ecosystem. Senior National Security Agency official Rob Joyce said Wednesday that there had been a decline in ransomware attacks against US organizations since the war began. But gathering authoritative data on ransomware attacks is difficult, as many victims do not report hacks. And US officials and private analysts have warned that the threat of ransomware will remain.",3,6.8134077485099365,8.498097575287845,-1.684689826777909,18

The soldier, Vadim Shishimarin, had pleaded guilty to shooting a 62-year-old civilian to death on the fourth day of the conflict in late February. Before delivering the verdict on Monday, the court said that Shishimarin had ""committed a criminal offense"" according to international humanitarian law. ""[Shishimarin] saw a civilian on the pavement, Oleksandr Shelipov,"" the court said. ""Shishimarin knowing that Shelipov is a civilian and is unarmed and does not pose any threat to him -- fired several shots at Shelipov from his AK-gun."" ""The cause of Shelipov's death was a shot in the head that resulted in crushing of the skull,"" the court added. The sentence may be appealed within 30 days. Prosecutor Andriy Sunyuk raised the possibility of more war crimes trials against Russian troops, and said he hoped Shishimarin's conviction could send a message. ""I think that all other law enforcement agencies will move along the path that we have traveled,"" he said. ""This will be a good example for other occupiers who may not yet be on our territory but are planning to come,"" added Sunyuk. ""Or for those who are here now and plan to stay and fight. Or maybe they will think that it's time to leave here for their own territory."" Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin is ""concerned"" about Shishimarin and will seek ways of assisting him. ""Of course, we are concerned about the fate of our citizen,"" Peskov told reporters on a regular conference call. ""We do not have many opportunities to protect his interests on the ground, as foreign institutions actually have no activity [in Kyiv]. But this does not mean that we will not consider the possibility of making attempts through other channels,"" Peskov added, without clarifying which channels he was speaking about. Peskov previously said Russia considers the charges ""unacceptable,"" ""outrageous"" and ""staged."" Speaking Friday, Shishimarin acknowledged he was responsible for the killing but was ""sorry and sincerely repents."" ""I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn't want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,"" he said. Shishimarin's lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, argued that while his client was guilty of killing, it was not murder. ""Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,"" Ovsyannikov said. Ovsyannikov attempted to paint his client and other Russian troops as unwitting pawns in the Kremlin's Machiavellian scheme. The soldiers, Ovsyannikov said, were not aware that their actions would ""result in mass deaths not only of servicemen, but civilians too."" Shishimarin, who appeared in court behind glass wearing a blue-gray top with a shaved head, only spoke on several occasions during the proceedings. He said he was ""fully guilty"" when he entered a plea on Wednesday and, on Thursday he was forced to confront his victim's widow. Shishimarin told her: ""I understand that you will not be able to forgive me, but I am sorry."" The woman questioned the Russian soldier as to why he came to Ukraine, asking rhetorically: ""Did you come to defend us? From whom? Did you defend me from my husband you killed?"" ""We were ordered to come with the column, what will follow I did not know,"" Shishimarin said.",13,6.637104670083683,3.646499937033173,2.9906047330505094,27
2022-05-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/europe/russia-ukraine-filtration-camps-intl-cmd/index.html,Ukrainians must endure a brutal 'filtration' process to escape Russian-held territory. Here's what that means,"""What would happen if we cut off your ear?"" the soldiers asked Oleksandr Vdovychenko. Then they hit him in the head. The punches kept coming whenever his interrogators -- a mixture of Russian soldiers and pro-Russian separatists -- didn't like his answers, he later told his family. The men asked about his politics, his future plans, his views on the war. They checked his documents, took his fingerprints and stripped him to check if he had any nationalist tattoos or marks caused by wearing or carrying military equipment. ""They were trying to beat something out of him,"" his daughter Maria Vdovychenko told CNN in an interview. Maria said her father received so many blows to his head during the interrogation last month that several medical examinations have now confirmed his sight has been permanently damaged. Yet Oleksandr was one of the lucky ones. He made it through ""filtration."" When Russian troops first started taking over villages and towns in eastern Ukraine in early March, following their invasion of the country, evidence began to emerge of civilians being forced to undergo humiliating identity checks and often violent questioning before being allowed to leave their homes and travel to areas still under Ukrainian control. Three months into the war, the dehumanizing process known as filtration has become part of the reality of life under Russian occupation. CNN spoke to a number of Ukrainians who have gone through the filtration process over the last two months. Many are too scared to speak publicly, fearing for the safety of relatives and friends who are still trying to escape Russian-held areas. All of the people CNN spoke to have described facing threats and humiliation during the process. Many have witnessed or know of people who have been picked up by Russian troops or separatist soldiers and subsequently disappeared without a trace. For most of the people CNN spoke to, the filtration process included document checks, interrogation, fingerprinting and a search. Many were separated from their families. Men were routinely stripped and examined. Lyudmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament's human rights ombudsman, said earlier this month that Russian forces had created an ""extensive network"" of places where Ukrainians are being subjected to ""filtering."" She said such places have been established ""in every occupied Ukrainian city"" and that more than ""37,000 citizens"" have already gone through the procedure. Nikolay Ryabchenko told CNN he fled Mariupol in mid-March when the city was closed and people were not allowed to move around. ""We found a way to avoid checkpoints and came to Nikolske and we stayed there for a couple of weeks,"" he said. ""I asked everyone I met how to get out and they [said] filtration is obligatory."" Information signs that have been posted in Mariupol after Russian troops took over the city leave no room for doubt: ""Evacuation can be carried out if there is a document confirming the passage of the filtration procedure."" CNN has seen a photo of one such sign taken by a person who escaped the city. ""Everyone has to go through filtration, both men and women, in order to move around the city freely,"" 20-year old Karina, another Mariupol resident, who is only being identified by her first name due to security concerns, told CNN. She has managed to escape Mariupol but her father, who has not yet passed the filtration process and has no idea why, is still there. A month after being picked up by Russian soldiers on a street in Mariupol, he is still being held in what the self-declared separatist Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) in eastern Ukraine calls a ""reception center"" at a school in Bezimenne, around 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of Mariupol, he told his daughter. The separatist-held Bezimenne has been used by Russian troops as a screening facility for refugees from Mariupol and surrounding areas. In three separate statements published last week, the DPR Territorial Defense said almost 1,000 evacuees from Mariupol have been brought to the Bezimenne center in a three days. It said that as of May 17, more than 33,000 people have gone through the facility. Earlier this month, the Russian Ministry of Defence released a video showing evacuees from Mariupol arrive in a filtration camp outside the city in busses. The ministry published the videos without saying where the refugees were taken, or when the evacuations took place. CNN has been able to geolocate the footage, and it shows that they were taken to Bezimenne. Separately, satellite images from Maxar Technologies have showed a tent encampment being erected in the separatist-held Bezimenne as early as in March. Karina said she had been able to speak to her father who told her that conditions there were appalling. ""Some sleep on the floor, some are luckier [and sleep] on chairs, and some are even luckier and have mattresses in the gym,"" she said. ""There's no opportunity to wash and no normal restroom. All of them were ill because it was too cold to sleep on the floor."" Karina said her father had told her the guards in the center have refused to provide any medicine to the people being held there. They are being fed watery soup and other prison-like food cooked in a field kitchen, he said. Ombudsman Denisova said the Bezimenne center where Karina's father is being held is just one of several such facilities set up in the Donetsk region. She said Russian troops have established similar filtration camps in Dokuchaevsk, Mykilsky, Mangush, Bezymenny and Yalta. She accused Russia of using the centers to detain and ""wipe out"" any ""officials, members of the military or the volunteer territorial defense forces, activists or anyone they consider a threat."" Maria Vdovychenko told CNN it looked like the soldiers were trying to find anything they could say was incriminating. ""They were looking for Ukrainian-speaking people, for Ukrainian symbols, tattoos,"" she said, adding that the soldiers checked her phone, but didn't find anything compromising. ""We have deleted everything because people in the line told us they can look at everything -- contacts, for example, they could call some of your contacts -- and pictures ... For every Ukrainian, it is normal to have pictures in vyshyvanka [traditional Ukrainian embroidered clothing] or with a flag, or near [a] Shevchenko monument [depicting prominent Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko],"" Maria said. ""I'm a bandura [traditional Ukrainian instrument] player, it wasn't good idea to show that. So I deleted that, took a couple of new pictures, and deleted my social network profiles,"" she added. Michael Carpenter, the US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said last month there was credible reporting that ""Russia's forces are rounding up the local civilian populations in these areas, detaining them in these camps, and brutally interrogating them for any supposed links to the legitimate Ukrainian government or to independent media outlets. Speaking last week, Carpenter added: ""Numerous eyewitness accounts indicate that 'filtering out' entails beating and torturing individuals to determine whether they owe even the slightest allegiance to the Ukrainian state."" Mariupol city council has accused Russian forces of using the filtration centers to identify witnesses to any ""atrocities"" committed by Russian troops during the battle for the control of the city. CNN could not verify that claim. The Kremlin has denied using filtration camps to cover up wrongdoing and targeting civilians in Mariupol. The self-declared DPR has denied accusations by Ukrainian authorities of unlawful detentions, filtration and maltreatment of Ukrainian citizens and said that those arriving at what it calls reception centers are properly fed and provided medical attention. Karina said that, according to her father, most of the men in the center have no idea why they are being held. ""They were told the filtration would take one to two days maximum and that the [process] is needed to check if they took part in hostilities,"" Karina told CNN. ""They have been trapped there since April 12 and have no idea when they will be released."" That uncertainty makes the process terrifying for Ukrainians trying to flee to safety. Most have no idea what to expect. Ukrainian social media pages for people stuck in Russian-controlled regions, or their families searching for them, are full of questions about filtration. Yana, who left Berdiansk in southern Ukraine to stay with relatives in Rostov in Russia, the only place she said she was able to get to, said the process appeared to be completely random. She asked CNN not to publish her last name, fearing retribution. ""Close friends told me that they stood in line for filtration for six days, spent the nights in cars, and yet some passed quickly. I don't know why -- apparently it depends on which shift you will get,"" she said. Before the war, Eugen Tuzov was a martial arts instructor in Mariupol. Now he spends most of his time trying to organize transport for people stuck in the Russian-occupied city and the surrounding areas who want to flee to places under Ukrainian control. He, too, told CNN the filtration process at checkpoints on the roads leading out of Mariupol -- he said there were at least 27 of them -- appeared to be random. ""Everything depends on [the] shift. Someone is lucky, someone comes to a sh*tty shift,"" he said. ""The DPR people were the worst -- they are disheveled, slovens, sometimes they are drunk already in the morning, behaving terribly. You see man 50, 60 years old and you can see it from his face that he drinks constantly,"" Ryabchenko told CNN. Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the Mariupol mayor, said in a statement on Monday that Russian troops have set up five filtration points across the city. Mariupol residents need to pass this procedure in order to receive a certificate allowing them to move around the city, he said, adding: ""If this isn't a ghetto, I don't know what is."" Yana said her parents had to undergo filtration at a hospital in Donetsk, where they were taken after being wounded in a strike, having already spent more than two weeks hiding in a shelter in Mariupol with no medical help. ""People came from some service, took their fingerprints, told them this is filtration since they could not walk, but it had to be done, such rules are in the DPR,"" she said. Yana said when she and her husband drove out of the area, they had to pass almost 20 checkpoints. ""And at almost every checkpoint, they undressed my husband, looked for tattoos and weapons marks and asked whether he had served in the army,"" she said. Tuzov said the volunteers in his transport service have similar experiences; he said some were subjected to lie detector tests and that -- as far as he knows -- at least 30 of them were detained during the process.

Here's where things stand,"It is nearly three months since Russia invaded Ukraine -- a 12-week period in which Russian forces have wrought devastation on the country and its people, resulting in death on a vast scale and causing millions to flee. But the invasion has not been the military success Moscow hoped, and is now deep into its second phase. The bulk of fighting has moved to the east, after failed Russian advances in central Ukraine. The defenders are even focusing on retaking some key areas nearer the Russian border, while Moscow is seeing its troops beaten back in a few key battles. Western aid is also flowing into Ukraine, NATO is set to be strengthened as countries seek to join, and the first Russian soldier accused of war crimes has stood trial. Here's what has happened in several key areas since the war began. Donbas After weeks of intense fighting, Ukraine's eastern Donbas region is ""completely destroyed,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday. He accused Russia of a ""deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible"" after a village in Chernihiv was hit with missiles, leaving many dead. Officials in the region say the front line is being shelled ""day and night,"" with Russian forces attempting to break through Ukrainian lines. A NATO military official told CNN Wednesday that the alliance expects something of a stalemate over the next few weeks. But the official said NATO believes momentum has shifted significantly in favor of Ukraine and the debate within NATO circles is now over whether it is possible for Kyiv to retake Crimea and the Donbas territories seized by Russia and Russian-backed separatists, respectively, in 2014. Kharkiv Ukrainian forces have beaten back Russia's assaults in Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, and advanced toward the border in several places north and east of the city. Ukrainian officials said last week they were liberating villages on the outskirts of the city. Their advances led to the symbolic and embarrassing expulsion of the Kremlin's forces back to their own border while posing the strategic threat of cutting Russia's supply lines into Ukraine and its forces further south in Donbas. Anastasia Paraskevova recently returned to her home in Kharkiv for the first time since fleeing the city two months ago. It had been under constant bombardment since then, until Russian forces were repelled. Paraskevova said overall the experience was good. ""The city was much more alive. People were walking the streets. And some shops were working. It felt like some life was back, much better than it was when I was here in March."" Kherson Every day, hundreds, or even thousands, of people are trying to flee the Russian-occupied region of Kherson in southern Ukraine. The city has been under Russian control since early in the invasion. Ukrainians are leaving for many reasons: to avoid being detained or to escape the heavy-handed actions of Russian forces, or because of the chronic shortages of medicine and other basics in Kherson, which fell under Russian control soon after the invasion. Last week, a convoy of about 1,000 vehicles tried to leave Kherson. The Russians ultimately let the convoy move in batches -- but only after holding it in one place for most of the day. Mariupol Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, finally fell to Russian forces after weeks of relentless bombardment. The city was the scene of some of the most intense fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater where hundreds of civilians had sought refuge from the violence. Mariupol became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as its defenders held out at Azovstal, a sprawling steelworks plant where as many as 1,000 civilians had taken shelter at one point, with stocks of food and water dwindling. Ukraine's military announced late Monday that its forces had completed their ""combat mission"" at Azovstal, effectively ceding the city to Russian forces. On Friday, Ukraine ordered its forces to stop defending the plant. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered at Azovstal. CNN cannot independently verify that figure. With the city now almost fully under Russian control, there is concern that evidence of any potential war crimes -- like those allegedly committed in Bucha and Borodianka -- could be lost or destroyed. Bucha More evidence of potential Russian war crimes is emerging in Bucha, the northern Ukrainian city near Kyiv, the capital. An investigation by The New York Times alleged that Russian paratroopers carried out summary executions of at least eight Ukrainian men in Bucha on March 4. Evidence of mass graves and civilian executions in the towns of Bucha and Borodianka has continued to emerge since early April, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region. Images of bodies lying strewn the streets of Bucha have sparked international condemnation and fueled calls for an investigation into potential Russian war crimes. CNN visited the scene of mass graves in Bucha in April after Russian forces had withdrawn, revealing the horrors of their occupation to the world. Correspondent Fred Pleitgen was among the first to reach a mass grave that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling. A soldier stands trial This week saw the start of the first war crimes trial in Ukraine since the invasion began. A 21-year-old Russian soldier named Vadim Shishimarin pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed 62-year-old man. The trial's first day was so packed with journalists that authorities in Kyiv were forced to move to bigger venue. It has since produced several dramatic moments, including a confrontation between the soldier and the victim's widow and testimony from Shishimarin himself. Speaking Friday, Shishimarin acknowledged he was responsible for the killing but was ""sorry and sincerely repents."" ""I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn't want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,"" he said. Shishimarin's lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, argued that while his client was guilty of killing, it was not murder. ""Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,"" Ovsyannikov said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Russia has no details about Shishimarin's case and it considers the charges ""unacceptable,"" ""outrageous"" and ""staged."" Diplomats return Foreign diplomatic missions started coming back to life in Kyiv this week, after diplomats fled the city en masse at the beginning of the conflict. The US flag was raised over the United States Embassy to mark the official resumption operations on Wednesday, while the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Thursday it would also reopen its embassy. The US and France both began sending back diplomats to Kyiv in late April. A massive aid package US lawmakers passed a bill Thursday that will send roughly $40 billion to Ukraine to pay for military and humanitarian aid, including funding that will assist Ukrainian military and national security forces, help replenish stores of US equipment sent to Ukraine and provide public health and medical support for Ukrainian refugees. US President Joseph Biden signed the aid package while he was in South Korea. Nordic developments Russia stopped sending natural gas to Finland Saturday, just days after it and Sweden applied to join NATO. Helsinki and Stockholm had, for decades, avoided joining the alliance, but cited Moscow's invasion as the ultimate impetus to do so now. The two countries formally handed in their applications Wednesday. Most NATO members appear ready to support both bids, except for Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that his country ""will say no to Sweden's and Finland's entry into NATO,"" citing their support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK seeks an independent state in Turkey and has been in an armed struggle with Ankara for decades. It has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Some experts say Erdogan may be angling for concessions or to highlight grievances Turkey wishes to bring to the attention of the international community.",17,3.9182389969888156,6.34173276707313,-2.423493770084314,21
2022-05-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/politics/us-troops-in-europe/index.html,"US likely to keep 100,000 troops in Europe for foreseeable future in face of Russian threat, US officials say","The US is expected to keep 100,000 troops stationed in Europe for the foreseeable future unless Russia escalates and threatens Sweden and Finland or NATO members, according to multiple US officials. The numbers could temporarily increase if NATO carries out more military exercises in the region, and the US could add additional bases in Europe if the security environment changes, the officials added. The plans are being considered following Thursday's meeting of NATO's military chiefs in Brussels, the officials said. The military chiefs are making the recommendations to a NATO defense ministers meeting planned for June, and NATO leaders including President Joe Biden will meet in Madrid at the end of that month. The US increased its overall force posture in Europe from about 60,000 troops before Russia's invasion of Ukraine to about 100,000 now, adding troops and military assets to countries along Europe's eastern flank to support NATO and to further deter Russia. The US contributed thousands of troops to NATO's Response Force, which was activated for the first time in NATO's history earlier this spring. These recommendations are consistent with what top military leaders have been telling US lawmakers. In April, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told members of Congress he endorsed creating permanent US bases in Eastern Europe as a response to Russia's attack on Ukraine. But Milley said he believed US troops at those bases could be rotational. He said he didn't think the US needed to permanently station troops at them to create an effective deterrent. NATO's military chiefs, including Gen. Tod Wolters who serves as both Commander of US European Command and Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, participated in the meetings in Brussels as the war in Ukraine grinds on, nearing the three-month mark since Russia's invasion began. The US added thousands of troops in Europe on temporary rotations, deployed additional military assets to the Eastern flank to support eight new NATO battlegroups, and sent billions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine, alongside NATO allies. However, the Pentagon recently announced replacement troops for those temporary rotations, signaling the increased US presence will be maintained for some time to come. The Pentagon announced that approximately 10,500 US Army personnel would be deployed to Europe in the coming weeks and months to replace forces that are already there on May 13. As well as the larger NATO meetings Gen. Milley also met military leaders from France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom as well as Finland and Sweden this week, according to readouts from Joint Staff Spokesperson Col. Dave Butler. As Sweden and Finland are poised to join NATO, US officials don't believe additional forces will be needed unless Russia suddenly poses a threat to the two Nordic countries. If Russia were to move weaponry or make serious threats to move weaponry closer, the force posture might have to be further reassessed, the officials said. Sweden and Finland have expressed concerns about their security in the interim period after they submitted their applications for membership, asking certain NATO allies for additional security support while the process plays out. Certain nations have agreed to provide additional support to the two countries, Admiral Robert Bauer, Chair of the NATO Military Committee, said Thursday. Most NATO members have welcomed Finland and Sweden's application to join but Turkey has raised objections. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist at the Pentagon Wednesday, a day before the NATO military chiefs meeting in Brussels. ""The secretary made it very clear that we have a comfort level with their military going back many years, and that at a staff level we'll be happy to have a discussion with them about security and capability needs that they might have to help assure them and to deter Russia should that be necessary,"" a senior defense official said of the meeting between Austin and Hultqvist Wednesday. The official said there would be continued staff level discussions about what the needs of Sweden's might be and how the US could help fulfill them, and that the US has also engaged Finland in similar staff level discussions. The request for additional security needs might not result in additional US troops, the official added. As an example, the US might engage in additional military exercises with Sweden or Finland, according to the official. A more permanent force posture change NATO and US leaders have been hinting at a more permanent change in European force posture in response to Russia's ongoing invasion with a possible announcement at the NATO summit in Madrid next month. It could solidify the 100,000 troop level for some time to come. In April, Austin told US lawmakers that the war in Ukraine and Putin's actions will change the US military footprint in Europe. ""This unlawful and unprovoked aggression by Putin has the effect of changing the security architecture in the region for some time to come,"" Austin said. ""We do expect that it will change our footprint. In terms of how much it changes the US contribution, that's left to be seen."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg both hinted at an announcement about a more permanent change in NATO's military posture, specifically in Eastern Europe at the conclusion of the NATO informal foreign ministers ministerial in Berlin, Germany on May 15. ""We also spent time here in Berlin laying the groundwork for next month's summit in Madrid,"" Blinken said during a press conference at the conclusion of the NATO informal meeting in Berlin. ""NATO is going to release its new Strategic Concept laying out how the Alliance will sustain and strengthen transatlantic security in the face of President Putin's aggression as well as other emerging threats. And we'll look ahead to our continuing efforts to fortify our force posture on NATO's eastern flank."" Stoltenberg said the alliance will ""make important decisions to reinforce NATO's deterrence and defense to reflect the new security reality in Europe,"" during the summit in Madrid next month after the conclusion of the informal meeting in Berlin on May 15.",29,4.222757267656664,7.5383391601575,-3.3155818925008367,2
2022-05-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/europe/bucha-ukraine-reported-killings-intl/index.html,New York Times: Investigation reveals potential war crime in Bucha involving Russian forces,"Russian paratroopers executed at least eight Ukrainian men in the town of Bucha on March 4, in what appears to be a potential war crime, according to a New York Times investigation published Thursday. Based on eye-witness testimonies and three videos obtained and analyzed by The Times, the investigation details the alleged execution of eight Ukrainian men by Russian paratroopers occupying Bucha in early March. The timeline of the incident is established by two videos analyzed by the paper, which appear to capture Russian paratroopers leading a group of Ukrainian men at gunpoint to a Russian-held office building, where their bodies would later be found. Several eyewitnesses The Times spoke with -- including one of the men involved in the incident who was shot but managed to survive -- allege an execution-style killing took place in the moments that followed. A drone video filmed one day after the alleged incident appears to corroborate the events, as it shows two Russian soldiers guarding several dead bodies outside the same office building, according to the NYT analysis. ""I was shot and I fell down. The bullet went into my side,"" said Ivan Skyba, whom the Times identifies as a 43-year-old builder. ""I fell down and I pretended to be dead,"" he said. ""I didn't move and didn't breathe,"" he told the Times. The Times identified the soldiers involved as paratroopers based on an analysis of their equipment from CCTV footage captured in early March, when Russian forces still occupied Bucha, along with evidence left behind at the Russian-held office building where the shootings occurred. Based on translated text messages, interviews with local authorities, family members and witnesses, The Times investigation identified eight of the men who were executed in the March 4 incident. According to the investigation, all had joined local paramilitary groups in Bucha in the days before they were killed. None of the videos in the report have been reviewed or verified by CNN, and the victims' identities have not been corroborated. Evidence of mass graves and civilian executions in the towns of Bucha and Borodianka has continued to emerge since early April, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region. Images of bodies lying strewn the streets of Bucha have sparked international condemnation and fueled calls for an investigation into potential Russian war crimes. CNN visited the scene of mass graves in Bucha in April after Russian forces had withdrawn, revealing the horrors of their occupation to the world. Correspondent Fred Pleitgen was among the first to reach a mass grave that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling. During a visit to Bucha and Borodianka in mid-April, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan said there were ""reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC"" were being committed in both towns. But Khan also warned that it would be ""challenging"" to guarantee justice would be served in Ukraine, given Russia's decision to withdraw its signature from the ICC statute, which gives the court jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Russia also doesn't extradite its citizens to other countries. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the mass killings of civilians in Ukraine, while reiterating baseless claims that images of bodies on the streets of Bucha are ""fake."" The New York Times reported that the Russian Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense did not respond to their request for comment. CNN has also contacted those ministries. Khan addressed Russia's claims of disinformation directly. ""Those bodies that are in those bags on the screen are not fake. I've seen them. I stood beside them. The issue is how did they die, who is responsible and in what circumstances?"" Khan said, adding that the world was watching to see how ""effective the rule of law"" would be regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",13,9.174527080030774,8.57223927746513,0.6022878025656446,19
2022-05-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/politics/biden-finland-sweden-meeting-white-house/index.html,"Biden says Finland and Sweden have 'full, total, complete backing' of US as they seek to join NATO","President Joe Biden on Thursday welcomed the leaders of Finland and Sweden to the White House and said both countries have the ""full, total, complete backing"" of the US after the two nations submitted their formal applications to become NATO members. ""Today, I am proud to welcome and offer the strong support of the United States for the applications of two great democracies and two close, highly capable partners to join the strongest, most powerful defensive alliance in the history of the world,"" Biden said while standing alongside Finnish President Sauli Niinistö and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson. The US President said, ""The bottom line is simple, quite straightforward: Finland and Sweden make NATO stronger. Not just because of their capacity but because of their strong, strong democracies."" Sweden and Finland's bids to join NATO come in response to Russia's war on Ukraine, which sparked security concerns across the region. The historically neutral nations' bids to join the alliance mark a dramatic evolution in European security and geopolitics, and the moves have been met with resistance from Russia and Turkey, a NATO member. ""Let me be clear: New members joining NATO is not a threat to any nation. It never has been. NATO's purpose is to defend against aggression. That's its purpose, to defend,"" Biden said. The President argued Russia's war on Ukraine has made the military alliance ""stronger"" and ""more united,"" and said, ""Today, there is no question, NATO is relevant. It is effective. And it is more needed now than ever."" Biden said his administration was submitting reports on NATO accession for both Finland and Sweden so the Senate ""can efficiently and quickly move on advising and consenting to the treaty."" He said Finland and Sweden requesting to join NATO is a ""victory for democracy in action,"" and said both nations meet all the requirements to join the alliance. Both Finland and Sweden already meet many of the requirements to be a NATO member, which include having a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy; treating minority populations fairly; committing to resolve conflicts peacefully; the ability and willingness to make a military contribution to NATO operations; and committing to democratic civil-military relations and institutions. All 30 NATO members must give unanimous approval for a country to be accepted into the alliance. ""Having two new NATO members in the high north will enhance the security of our alliance and deepen our security cooperation across the board,"" Biden said. National security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday called Finland and Sweden's applications to join the alliance ""a watershed moment in European security."" ""Two nations with a long tradition of neutrality will be joining the world's most powerful defensive alliance, and they will bring with them strong capabilities and a proven track record as security partners,"" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Finland and Sweden's entry into NATO would not create a threat to Russia, but the ""expansion of military infrastructure into this territory will certainly cause our response."" And the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday that Russia ""will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to stop the threats to its national security arising in this regard."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said this week that he would not approve Sweden and Finland's membership if they sanction Turkey, and that delegations from the nations should not bother coming to Turkey to try to convince that nation to approve their country's NATO membership. Sullivan said on Wednesday that the White House is ""confident"" that the applications for membership to NATO will be approved, despite Turkey's concerns. Both Sweden and Finland are both engaged with Turkey regarding its concerns, as well as top US officials, he said. Biden on Wednesday also seemed optimistic that Turkey would come around. When asked how he will convince Turkey to support Finland and Sweden's bids for membership, Biden told reporters, ""The leaders of Finland and Sweden are coming to see me on Thursday. I think we're gonna be OK."" Thursday's White House meeting with the two northern European leaders will took place just before Biden is expected to depart for a four-day trip to South Korea and Japan -- his first trip to Asia as President.",29,6.840355245067402,0.7582546835690779,6.082100561498324,13
2022-05-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/europe/sweden-finland-nato-analysis-intl/index.html,The most striking aspect of Sweden and Finland's application to join NATO,"The most striking aspect of Sweden and Finland's application to join NATO is how little debate there is about whether it's a wise idea. The entry of the two Nordic nations would be the most significant geopolitical outcome of the Ukraine war, transforming the strategic security picture in northeastern Europe and adding hundreds of miles of direct NATO borders with Russia. For decades, even during the most tense moments of the Cold War, neither country seemed to feel the need to join the Western military alliance despite their proximity to the giant to their east. But that changed this year, after Putin sent tanks rolling across the border into Ukraine in February. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson on Sunday called the invasion of Ukraine ""illegal and indefensible,"" and worried that Moscow might do something similar ""in our immediate vicinity."" Finnish President Sauli Niinistö told CNN the same day that the invasion indicated Russia was ready to attack an ""independent, neighboring country."" Many analysts believe that one of the main goals of Russia's invasion was to weaken NATO by taking Kyiv's possible future membership off the board. If so, it has backfired spectacularly. The alliance is now stronger and more united than it has been for years, and it could soon be much larger. But expanding NATO could also trigger serious reverberations. Doubling the security alliance's direct frontier with Russia would be a personal blow for Putin, who has focused on undermining the Western alliance since he first became Russia's President, more than 20 years ago. And if Putin felt Russia was already being hemmed in on its western flank, could adding two more NATO members during the worst tension between the West and Moscow in decades exacerbate the Russian leader's paranoia? In the 1990s, revered US diplomat George Kennan — the founder of the Cold War containment policy of Russia — warned that NATO expansion would alienate Russia and cause an adverse reaction. A contemporary counterargument would be that Moscow's terrible losses in Ukraine, dented military prowess and failure to siege Kyiv show that it is too weak to do anything about an expanding NATO. And why should Putin get any say in who joins the alliance anyway? The Kremlin's response to Finland and Sweden hasn't exactly been thundering so far. But it's still a formidable nuclear power and any decision to move missiles or tactical nuclear weapons closer to NATO borders could trigger a new game of brinkmanship in Europe. There's a domestic US political angle to this as well: As President Joe Biden prepares to welcome the leaders of Sweden and Finland to the White House on Thursday, no one has explained to the American people why they must now defend vast tracts of new NATO territory in Europe. That's a significant omission given hostility to NATO among supporters of former President Donald Trump — who might just end up back in the White House one day. The most likely outcome here is still that the benefits outweigh the risks: Broadening NATO will enhance European security and be a bulwark for Western values. But that such a change is taking place without much public debate about the consequences doesn't really lend much credit to the democracies that NATO was set up to defend.",29,1.4705180045395632,5.127384471294333,-3.6568664667547695,9
2022-05-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/europe/russia-bloggers-ukraine-criticism-intl-cmd/index.html,Setbacks in Ukraine trigger rare criticism of Russia's war effort by Russian bloggers,"The Russian army's performance in Ukraine has been less than impressive according to Western intelligence assessments -- and that viewpoint is gaining ground among some in Russia itself. Three Russian military bloggers have suddenly launched into damning criticism of the operation, and especially the debacle of a failed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets river last week. The three bloggers combined have more than three million subscribers on Telegram. A prominent former officer who regularly appears on state television also weighed in with a gloomy view of Russia's military prospects in Ukraine. Such public criticism of the military operation in Ukraine is very rare. The Kremlin insists the campaign is on schedule. The carping appears to have been triggered by a catalog of setbacks, the worst being the disastrous attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets crossing last week. Satellite imagery shows at least 70 Russian armored vehicles and tanks were destroyed and hundreds of soldiers may have been killed. On the evening of May 12, prominent Russian military correspondent Yuri Kotenok reposted accounts and images of the failed crossing, including one from a Ukrainian source. Kotenok, who has nearly 300,000 subscribers to his Telegram channel, reposted one account that castigated the Russian officer responsible and blamed him for crowding so many vehicles in a small area by the river. In response to criticism from some subscribers, Kotenok retorted: ""If you want fairy tales, then you have come to the wrong place. In such a case you should go to officialdom."" He said his role was ""to provide with correct assessment, to speak good of the good, and bad of the bad, but to say the TRUTH."" Kotenok even had a dig at Russian television coverage. ""If you want to sit in a warm bath and 'fight' softly and soothingly, then you are welcome to the television. There you will find a lot of things for the delight of your ears and eyes,"" he said. The correspondent has been on the frontlines of other conflicts and said that he carried shrapnel in his body, before concluding: ""In war it happens that we suffer losses. Know this and ... be silent if you have nothing to say in essence."" Calls for change Several other popular Telegram accounts in Russia picked up the theme. In a series of posts, blogger Vladlen Tatarskiy blamed the Russian commander of the operation. ""Until we find out the name of this 'military genius' who wasted the BTG [battalion tactical group] near the river and he publicly answers for this, there will be no reforms in the army,"" he wrote. ""The offensive in the Donbas is being hampered,"" he said, ""not only due to the lack of effective intelligence from UAVs [drones], but also due to such generals."" He said he'd been warning for 18 months that Russian forces lacked both strike and reconnaissance drones. Tatarskiy told CNN that he was not criticizing the entirety of what the Kremlin calls Russia's ""special military operation"" but ""individual episodes,"" and he still believed Russia would achieve its goals in Ukraine. ""I will personally make every effort to it,"" he added, speaking to CNN by text message. Nevertheless, he also called for broad change. ""All the areas need to be improved,"" he said. ""Each war reveals some drawbacks, shortcomings, or false experiences, experiences that need to be adjusted to the modern realities. So absolutely all spheres need reform,"" said Tatarskiy. Another Telegram blogger sharing his views goes by the name ""vysokogovorit,"" and has nearly 400,000 subscribers. ""Didn't the commander of the crossing at Bilohorivka have information that in the third month of the war, it was not permissible to move in large convoys, and let alone to accumulate them in a narrow fire-swept area in front of a water barrier?"" he posted. ""How much of an idiot do you have to be to not understand this? Although this may not be idiocy, but direct sabotage."" Vysokogovorit said he'd been part of a river crossing near Izium. ""So I know what I'm talking about."" Blogger Yuriy Podolyaka, who has more than two million subscribers, echoed the criticism and later posted that the Russian Defense Ministry had conducted an analysis of the pontoon bridge disaster and that lessons were being learned. CNN cannot verify his claim. The outbursts from such popular Telegram channels were as brief as they were unexpected. All three accounts quickly returned to familiar themes such as alleged atrocities of the Ukrainian army. But the fact that they even aired such views and have not been taken out of circulation has surprised some observers. 'Informational sedatives' Doubts about the course of the Russian operation have even emerged on one of state television's flagship shows. On Monday's edition of Rossiya One's 60 Minutes, retired colonel Mikhail Khodarenok warned that ""the situation for us will clearly get worse."" Khodarenok rejected the claim that the Ukrainian armed forces are in crisis and on the verge of a ""moral collapse"" -- describing such propaganda as ""informational sedatives."" ""To put it mildly, this is not true,"" he said. Despite pushback from the show's presenter, Khodarenok estimated that Ukraine could arm one million people. And with the US Lend-Lease military aid program beginning soon, he said, along with European assistance, ""we really need to treat this million Ukrainian soldiers as a reality in the near future."" Ukrainian soldiers' morale is more important than their training, he insisted. ""The desire to defend their motherland as they understand it in Ukraine very much exists,"" he said. ""Ultimately victory on the battlefield depends on the high morale of troops who are spilling blood for ideas they are ready to fight for,"" Khodarenok added -- possibly hinting at continuing reports of low morale in some Russian units in Ukraine. Khodarenok also took a critical view of Russia's broader situation. ""We are in total geopolitical isolation, the whole world is against us but we don't want to admit it,"" he said. ""As far as China and India are concerned, their support for us isn't so unconditional."" Another critical voice is a former commander in the separatist Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) militia, Igor Strelkov -- who was the DPR's self-proclaimed minister of defense when the Malaysian airliner MH17 was allegedly shot down by men under his command in 2014. Still influential in the DPR, Strelkov wrote Monday that ""the widely advertised late-April and early-May operation to defeat the Donetsk group of the enemy has FAILED."" In a long screed, Strelkov said that ""only tactical successes have been reached. Not a single large locality has been liberated...It's clear now that by early summer Donbas will not be fully liberated."" Strelkov, whose Telegram channel has nearly 400,000 followers, said that the Russian high command was too obvious in its approach and lacked any element of tactical surprise. Besides ""individual examples of 'outstanding lunacy'"" -- such as the attempt to cross the river, Strelkov said that ""the losses incurred in daily offensive battles (that do not end with the enemy's defeat) cannot be quickly compensated by trained replacements."" ""No one knows where [Ukraine] will strike and when our troops will finally run out of steam (although this can also be predicted which I'm not going to do),"" he added pessimistically. These rare voices of criticism in Russia and the DPR almost certainly do not portend any change of strategy on the part of the Kremlin, but their airing as Ukraine presses a counteroffensive in the northeast is in stark contrast to the monopoly of the state over media coverage of the invasion.",14,4.9395294112896115,6.334470749023958,-1.3949413377343465,24

The leaders are expected to discuss Finland and Sweden's NATO applications, European security and support for Ukraine amid Russia's invasion, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Both countries are looking to join the military alliance after Russia's assault on Ukraine sparked renewed security concerns across the region. Their historic bids to join NATO represent a dramatic evolution in European security and geopolitics. The US and other NATO leaders have expressed support for Finland and Sweden joining the military alliance. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the US would ""strongly support"" their NATO applications. Both Finland and Sweden already meet many of the requirements to be a NATO member, which include having a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy; treating minority populations fairly; committing to resolve conflicts peacefully; the ability and willingness to make a military contribution to NATO operations; and committing to democratic civil-military relations and institutions. But the move has been met with resistance by Russia and Turkey. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Finland and Sweden's entry into NATO would not create a threat to Russia, but the ""expansion of military infrastructure into this territory will certainly cause our response."" The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday that Russia ""will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to stop the threats to its national security arising in this regard."" Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said this week that he would not approve Sweden and Finland's NATO membership if they sanction Turkey and that delegations from the nations should not bother coming to Turkey to try to convince that nation to approve their country's NATO membership. The meeting comes the same day the President is set to depart for Seoul, South Korea, for his first trip to Asia as President. Biden is also scheduled to travel to Japan during the trip. The four-day trip to Asia is meant to underscore Biden's commitment to the region even as international attention is directed toward the crisis in Ukraine. But it also comes as Biden seeks to keep the US and its allies united against Russia's unprovoked war on Ukraine amid mounting civilian casualties and intensifying fighting.",29,7.846846495661627,7.599513490562885,0.24733300509874123,2
2022-05-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/europe/mariupol-battle-over-russia-control-cmd-intl/index.html,The fall of Mariupol could conceal war crimes evidence from the world and give Russia's offensive a boost,"After almost three months of intense bombardment, thousands of reported deaths and countless tales of horror and starvation, the battle for the city of Mariupol is nearing its conclusion. Ukraine's military announced late Monday that its forces had completed their ""combat mission"" at the sprawling Azovstal steelworks plant, which was for weeks the last major holdout in a city otherwise occupied by Russian troops. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers were evacuated from the facility and efforts were underway to evacuate those still inside. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, has been the scene of some of the most intense fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in late February. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater where hundreds of civilians had sought refuge from the violence. Now there are fears that evidence of further atrocities may be lost forever. Before the Kremlin took control of Mariupol, the city council accused Russian forces of trying to erase evidence, using mobile crematoria to dispose of bodies and identifying witnesses to any ""atrocities"" through filtration camps. CNN could not verify that claim. ""Murderers are covering their tracks,"" the council alleged. The Kremlin has denied many of these claims, including using filtration camps to cover up wrongdoing and targeting civilians in Mariupol. A symbol of resistance Mariupol became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance during weeks of relentless Russian attacks. While most of the city had already fallen, its defenders held out at Azovstal, where as many as 1,000 civilians had taken shelter at one point. Ukrainian officers described a bleak situation inside the steel plant, as stocks of food and water dwindled and hundreds of wounded were stranded without proper medical care. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that ""tens of thousands"" have died in Mariupol, while the regional military governor last month said those killed numbered as many as 22,000 -- though death tolls are difficult to verify in the fog of war. Mariupol's mayor has estimated that 90% of the city's infrastructure has been damaged, 40% of it beyond repair. Images of Mariupol's destruction have become symbols of the Kremlin's use of indiscriminate firepower in Ukraine, drawing stark visual parallels with the leveling of cities like Syria's Aleppo or the Chechen capital of Grozny. Controlling Mariupol is key to Russian efforts to take the wider Donbas region -- beyond the separatist-controlled territories -- according to Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military with the Washington-based Center for a New American Security. ""It's unrealistic to declare control of the Donbas without actual control over its major cities,"" he told CNN in an email last month. Kofman said the fall of Mariupol should free up manpower and logistics for the Kremlin's campaign in the rest of Donbas. But keeping the city under Moscow's thumb will also take substantial resources. Russia likely needs all the troops it can muster for its offensive in eastern Ukraine, where it has refocused its military efforts after pulling back from other parts of the country. Artillery fire and air strikes are continuing along the front lines in Luhansk and Donetsk, but the Ukrainian military says it is repelling Russian attempts to gain territory. Analysts say Russian forces simply tried to flatten Mariupol to make it easier to control -- especially given the history of the man put in charge of Russia's war effort, Gen. Alexander Dvornikov. Dvornikov led a division in the Kremlin's pacification campaign in Chechnya from 2000 to 2003 and headed Russia's forces in Syria from 2015 to 2016. In both cases, the Russian military left destruction in its wake, bombing civilian areas with little regard for casualties. ""He basically annihilated and obliterated the second-largest Syrian town of Aleppo. And his strategy was simply to bombard anything that was alive, target civilian infrastructure -- hospitals and schools -- and then basically take over what was left,"" said Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow at the UK-based think tank Chatham House. ""It is a similar strategy we are already seeing in Mariupol,"" she said last month, while the fighting was still ongoing. Ukraine's military intelligence has already accused Dvornikov of overseeing war crimes against the civilian population in Mariupol in the course of the siege. A full accounting Of the 450,000 people who lived in the city before the war, a third had already left by mid-April, according to Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko. Only 100,000 residents remain, and those who have fled bring with them the horror stories of war. Some residents who managed to leave the city have said they were ordered by Russian forces to evacuate to Russia through so-called ""filtration camps"" -- a practice that sparked painful memories of Joseph Stalin's forced relocation of millions of people to remote parts of the Soviet Union. Russian forces have also reportedly at times barred citizens from leaving. Many said they took shelter in basements for days on end to hide from the unrelenting artillery fire. One resident previously told CNN he was in a line waiting for fresh drinking water when a blast killed three people in front of him, including one who was decapitated. The Kremlin has denied many of these claims, including using filtration camps to cover up wrongdoing and targeting civilians in Mariupol. But Russian forces are already moving quickly to clean up some of the areas worst affected by their offensive, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the Mariupol mayor. ""Surprisingly, the plan to clear the debris coincides with the places of greatest destruction ... the drama theater, Myru Avenue, and now suddenly it is the hospital,"" said Andriushchenko, referring to hospital number three, which was heavily bombed in March. Video of the aftermath of the bombing showed heavily pregnant women being taken from the hospital; at least one later died. A Telegram channel that appears to be linked to the new Russian-backed administration in the city has announced that temporary employment is on offer ""gathering up the dead"" as well as in city improvements. A full accounting of the devastation there may be impossible as the city comes under full Russian control. The extent of the alleged war crimes committed in liberated northern Ukrainian cities, such as Bucha and Borodianka, only became apparent after Russian forces had fled. Those in Mariupol could have been subjected to the same kind of abuses. If the city remains under Moscow's control, a true record of what happened there may be lost to history.",17,6.010787194400699,6.349727655763315,-0.3389404613626166,1
2022-05-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/politics/russia-mcdonalds-nato-what-matters/index.html,"The death of the McDonald's peace theory, a dark day for capitalism","It's the definitive end of two distinct eras: The McDonald's era of burger diplomacy is over as it pulls completely out of Russia. Finland's and Sweden's era of neutrality toward Russia is over as they seek to join NATO. These developments should crush any doubt about the permanence of this new, less stable and more militarized world order brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. McDonald's in Russia was supposed to change the world It was a tectonic shift in world affairs when McDonald's opened its first store in Russia in January 1990. ""Granted that a Western hamburger emporium in Moscow has all the intrinsic appeal of an ice cream stand in hell,"" the skeptical-sounding CNN correspondent Richard Blystone said from Moscow in 1990. He marked the world-changing occasion and noted Russians used to dining in state-subsidized restaurants were shocked by the efficiency of mass-produced burgers and baffled by the promise of ""service with a smile."" Watch Blystone's report. 'De-Arching' Russia If you bought into the triumph of Western culture over Soviet Communism and the promise of ""burger diplomacy"" -- and who didn't in the early 1990s -- you might have wondered back then if NATO was no longer necessary. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed to stand up to the Soviet Union and stop the spread of communism. Now, it's the era of Big Macs as symbols of global peace that is officially over. In an email announcing the company would be ""'de-Arching' a major market"" for the first time in its history and completely exit Russia, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski noted that its existence in the country carried importance bigger than its burgers. ""In fact, hope is what brought McDonald's to the Russian market 32 years ago,"" Kempczinski said in his email, which is worth reading. ""Hope for a country that was opening itself to the world after decades of isolation. Hope that the world was becoming a little more connected -- and that being able to get the same Big Mac in Moscow that you got in Chicago was a tangible (and tasty) symbol of our growing connection."" That hope and promise, he argued, is now impossible to imagine after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What failed in the 'McDonald's peace theory'? Kempczinski also mentioned the ""McDonald's peace theory"" -- the overly simplistic and obviously flawed idea popularized by The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman in his 1999 book, ""The Lexus and Olive Tree."" The idea was that two countries with McDonald's might never go to war. It has never stood up to serious scrutiny. Paul Musgrave is a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has been critical of the idea of McDonald's diplomacy. I asked him on Monday for his thoughts on McDonald's exiting Russia, and he called it the true end of an era. ""The world of brands overcoming national loyalties was already on the ropes when Russia invaded Ukraine (again) in February,"" Musgrave said in an email. ""And as corporation after corporation sees the business climate in Putin's Russia as not only currently unfriendly but lastingly unfriendly, the notion that business will pave the way for democracy and peace has taken one battering too many."" Ending 50 years of neutrality Meanwhile, two countries in close proximity to Russia -- Finland and Sweden, both of which have McDonald's -- are moving to join NATO as soon as possible. Both countries weathered the entire Cold War in neutrality and without joining NATO. But Putin's aggression against Ukraine has them reassessing. Their governments could begin the process of applying to NATO this week. ""When we look at Russia, we see a very different kind of Russia today than we saw just a few months ago,"" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Sunday, according to CNN's report. ""Everything has changed when Russia attacked Ukraine. And I personally think that we cannot trust anymore there will be a peaceful future next to Russia."" Neutrality may not work in the future Sweden also sees a new future, in which sides must be taken. ""Military nonalignment has served Sweden well, but our conclusion is that it won't serve us equally well in the future,"" said Sweden's prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, according to The New York Times. The process to bring Sweden and Finland into NATO will take time as the legislatures of all 30 current NATO members must approve. At least one NATO member, Turkey, is not sold on the idea. But it will ultimately mean Russia would share an 830-mile border with a NATO country if Finland joins the alliance. A larger NATO is an obvious setback for Putin It was the possible addition of Ukraine to NATO that was supposed to be among Russian President Vladimir Putin's reasons for invading that country. So it is hard to see a NATO enlargement with Finland and Sweden (Ukraine would also like to join) as anything but a major backfire. With his military overextended in Ukraine and Finland already moving to sever many of its ties with Russia, there may be little Putin can do. Putin played it off On Monday, the Russian President argued the inclusion of Finland and Sweden in NATO is no threat to his country. ""As far as expansion goes, including new members Finland and Sweden, Russia has no problems with these states -- none. And so in this sense, there is no immediate threat to Russia from an expansion to include these countries,"" Putin said on Monday, according to Reuters, which notes this is a major shift in tone. He made the comments at a meeting of his own, smaller security alliance and warned against military buildups in the countries. Earlier his foreign minister said joining NATO would be a grave mistake for Finland and Sweden.",29,6.840294590342564,6.699631068211644,0.1406635221309207,13

Commanders of units stationed at the city's massive Azovstal steelworks plant have been ordered ""to save the lives of their personnel,"" the statement by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine added. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Monday from the steel plant, the last holdout in a city that had become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance under relentless Russian bombardment. Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar described the evacuation operation in a separate video statement, noting that some Ukrainian forces remain at Azovstal. ""Fifty-three seriously injured people were evacuated from Azovstal to a medical facility in Novoazovsk for medical care,"" she said. ""Another 211 people were taken to Olenivka through the humanitarian corridor."" An ""exchange procedure"" will see the evacuees eventually brought home, Malyar also said. According to Malyar, the defense of Mariupol meant Russian forces were not able to transfer about 20,000 personnel to other regions of Ukraine, and thus failed to capture Zaporizhzhia. Also on Tuesday, Malyar told journalists that the evacuation was the only way Azovstal's defenders could be rescued. ""Unfortunately, military unblocking is impossible in this situation. There could be no other way to rescue them than the way it is happening now. It was the only way out,"" Malyar said during a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine. Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's deputy prime minister, also said that Ukraine expects to carry out an exchange of Russian prisoners of war for the severely injured soldiers evacuated from Azovstal. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the fighters who left the plant will be treated in accordance with international law, adding on a regular conference call that Russian President Vladimir Putin allowed both civilians and the military to leave Azovstal after the troops laid down their arms. The Russian Investigative Committee said it would interrogate what it described as ""the surrendered militants"" in a statement published Tuesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the evacuation in a statement Monday, thanking the Ukrainian military and negotiators, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations. ""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,"" he said. ""The 82nd day of our defense is coming to an end. A difficult day. But this day, like all others, is aimed precisely at saving our country and our people,"" Zelensky said. The Russian Defense Ministry had earlier said that a ceasefire had been established to allow the passage of wounded Ukrainian servicemen, according to state news agency RIA Novosti. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, has been the scene of some of the most intense fighting in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion in late February. Many civilians have already been evacuated. But Ukrainian fighters in the city had, in April, vowed to ""fight until the end,"" despite being surrounded, low on ammunition and outnumbered by Russian forces. Russian TV network RT on Monday showed video of around 10 to 12 buses leaving the steel plant. The buses appeared to be a mixture of hospital and ordinary transport, some marked with a red cross. In her statement, Malyar credited ""the defenders of Mariupol"" for gaining Ukraine ""critical time to form reserves, regroup forces and receive assistance from partners."" ""Unfortunately, we do not have the opportunity to unblock Azovstal by military means,"" she said. The country's Azov Regiment on Monday also issued a statement saying ""the entire Mariupol garrison"" was following orders to save lives. ""In order to save lives, the entire Mariupol garrison is implementing the approved decision of the Supreme Military Command and hopes for the support of the Ukrainian people,"" the Azov Regiment said in a statement late Monday. ""The defenders of Mariupol fulfilled the order, despite all the difficulties, and distracted the overwhelming forces of the enemy for 82 days.""",17,6.840344558923786,4.5850723452173385,2.255272213706448,7
2022-05-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/europe/finland-nato-membership-russia-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Finland will seek to join NATO, leaders say, ditching decades of neutrality despite Russia's threats of retaliation","Finland's government said Sunday it intends to join NATO, ditching decades of neutrality and ignoring Russian threats of possible retaliation as the Nordic country attempts to strengthen its security following the onset of the war in Ukraine. Sweden's ruling party later said it will also support joining the alliance. The decision was announced at a joint press conference by President Sauli Niinistö and Prime Minister Sanna Marin, who said the move must be ratified by the country's parliament before Finland can formally seek membership of the alliance. ""We hope that the parliament will confirm the decision to apply for NATO membership,"" Marin said in Helsinki on Sunday. ""During the coming days. It will be based on a strong mandate, with the President of the Republic. We have been in close contact with governments of NATO member states and NATO itself."" ""We are close partners to NATO but it is a historic decision that we will join NATO and hopefully we are making the decisions together,"" she added. The move would bring the US-led military alliance up to Finland's 830-mile border with Russia, but could take months to finalize as the legislatures of all 30 current NATO members must approve new applicants. It also risks provoking the ire of Russia, whose president, Vladimir Putin, told his Finnish counterpart Niinistö on Saturday that abandoning military neutrality and joining the bloc would be a ""mistake,"" according to a Kremlin statement. On Saturday, Russia cut its electricity supply to the Nordic country following problems in receiving payments. Since the end of World War II, during which Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union, the country has been militarily non-aligned and nominally neutral in order to avoid provoking Russia. It has indulged the Kremlin's security concerns at times and tried to maintain good trading relations. The invasion of Ukraine has changed that calculation. On Saturday, Niinistö called to inform Putin of Finland's intentions to join the bloc, saying ""the Russian demands in late 2021 aiming at preventing countries from joining NATO and Russia's massive invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 have altered the security environment of Finland,"" according to a statement from the Finnish president's office. Marin reiterated the sentiment on Sunday, telling reporters that in regards to a nuclear threat, ""we wouldn't make these decisions that we are making now, if we didn't think that they are enhancing our strength or security. So of course we believe these are the right decisions and they will enhance our national security."" Sweden has expressed similar frustrations, and on Sunday the ruling Social Democratic Party announced the country should work toward joining NATO. A statement on the party's website said the party should, in case the application is granted by NATO, work to state unilateral conditions against the placement of nuclear weapons and permanent bases on Swedish territory. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson on Sunday called Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""illegal and indefensible,"" adding that her country ""can't rule out"" that Russia would take the same action ""in our immediate vicinity."" ""And this is what Sweden now has to consider, and given this, we feel that Sweden needs the formal security guarantees that a NATO membership brings,"" Andersson said during a press conference. Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde, meanwhile, called the move ""a historic decision"" in a tweet after the announcement, adding, ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has deteriorated the security situation for Sweden and Europe as a whole."" Both countries already meet many of the criteria for NATO membership, which include having a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy; treating minority populations fairly; committing to resolve conflicts peacefully; the ability and willingness to make a military contribution to NATO operations; and committing to democratic civil-military relations and institutions. Turkish reservations NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg responded to the news on Sunday saying ""NATO's door is open"" to the Nordic nations. ""Finland and Sweden are NATO's closest partners,"" Stoltenberg told a press conference. But NATO member Turkey, which has presented itself as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, has expressed reservations about integrating those two countries to the alliance. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday he is not looking at Finland and Sweden joining NATO ""positively,"" accusing both countries of housing Kurdish ""terrorist organizations."" Erdogan was referencing the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) which seeks an independent state in Turkey. The group has been in an armed struggle with Ankara for decades and has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Turkey also considers YPG fighters an extension of the PKK even through they were allies of the US-led coalition in Syria and played a major role in flushing out ISIS from northern Syria. Finland and Sweden have a Kurdish community, although Erdogan provided no detail as to whom he was referring. Responding to Erdogan's claim, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said Saturday: ""Well, on the terrorism issue, I want to be very clear we are part of the coalition against ISIS, we participate to the Marrakesh meeting. Fight against the terrorist is a very important topic for us."" On Sunday, President Niinistö said he was ""confused"" by Erdogan's skepticism, saying that during a telephone discussion a month ago the Turkish President seemed ""favorable"" to Finland joining the bloc. ""I think that what we need now is a very clear answer. I'm prepared to have a new discussion with President Erdogan about the problems he has raised,"" he added. While the ratification process could take time, Stoltenberg told reporters on Sunday that Turkey's intention ""is not to block membership."" ""I'm confident that we will be able to address the concerns that Turkey has expressed in a way that doesn't delay the membership or the accession process, so my intention is still to have a quick and swift process,"" he added. Putin sees the alliance as a bulwark aimed at Russia, despite the fact that the bloc has spent much of the post-Soviet period focusing on issues like terrorism and peacekeeping. Before Putin invaded Ukraine, he made clear his belief that NATO had edged too close to Russia and should be stripped back to its borders of the 1990s, before some countries that either neighbor Russia or were ex-Soviet states joined the military alliance. Ukraine's desire to join the alliance, and its status as a NATO partner -- seen as a step on the way to eventual full membership -- was one of the numerous grievances Putin cited in an attempt to justify his country's invasion of its neighbor. The irony is that the war in Ukraine has, effectively, given NATO a new purpose. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, public support for joining NATO in Finland has leaped from around 30% to nearly 80% in some polls. Most Swedes also approve of their country joining the alliance, according to opinion polls there. After appearing to cool the rhetoric on joining NATO in March, in a bid to placate Russia, Ukraine now hopes its application to join the bloc is considered quickly. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna told ABC that she hopes ""when (it) comes to the consideration of the Ukrainian application, it will also happen much faster.""",29,6.014669240947404,1.0591136539929542,4.95555558695445,13

Here's how it works and what comes next,"Finland and Sweden are poised to end decades of neutrality by joining NATO, a dramatic evolution in European security and geopolitics sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The two Nordic nations had long kept the military alliance at an arm's length, even while eying Russia to their east with caution. But Moscow's assault on Ukraine has sparked renewed security concern across the region, and the leaders of each country have signaled their desire to join the bloc after more than 75 years of military non-alignment. Here's what you need to know about how the war in Ukraine caused the shift, and what comes next. What's happened so far? Finnish leaders announced their intentions to join NATO on Thursday, and formally presented that desire at a press conference on Sunday. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson followed suit on Monday, confirming her government had decided to begin the process of seeking NATO membership. Finland's move to seek to join the alliance requires a vote in parliament, but given the support of the ruling government, that hurdle is expected to be passed comfortably. In Sweden, the move was debated in parliament on Monday and there is broad support for joining NATO, but the government does not need parliamentary consent to move ahead. ""When we look at Russia, we see a very different kind of Russia today than we saw just a few months ago,"" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Sunday. ""Everything has changed when Russia attacked Ukraine. And I personally think that we cannot trust anymore there will be a peaceful future next to Russia."" Joining NATO is ""an act of peace [so] that there will never again be war in Finland in the future,"" Marin said. Her Swedish counterpart, Andersson, said Monday: ""To ensure the safety of Swedish people, the best way forward is to join NATO together with Finland."" When asked when exactly the country will hand in the application, she said it could it happen either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday this week, adding that it needs to be done in coordination with Finland. The announcements were met with support from leaders in almost all NATO nations. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters ""the United States would strongly support the NATO application by either Sweden or Finland should they choose to formally apply to the alliance. We will respect whatever decision they make."" What comes next? NATO has what it calls an ""open door policy"" on new members -- any European country can request to join, so long as they meet certain criteria and all existing members agree. A country does not technically ""apply"" to join; Article 10 of its founding treaty states that, once a nation has expressed interest, the existing member states ""may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty ... to accede."" NATO diplomats told Reuters that ratification of new members could take a year, as the legislatures of all 30 current members must approve new applicants. Both Finland and Sweden already meet many of the requirements for membership, which include having a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy; treating minority populations fairly; committing to resolve conflicts peacefully; the ability and willingness to make a military contribution to NATO operations; and committing to democratic civil-military relations and institutions. The process may not be without hurdles; Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday he was not looking at both countries joining NATO ""positively,"" accusing them of housing Kurdish ""terrorist organizations."" Finnish President Sauli Niinistö told CNN he was ""confused"" by those comments on Sunday, claiming Erdogan had been far more receptive to the idea in a telephone conversation between the two leaders a month ago. ""I think that what we need now is a very clear answer. I'm prepared to have a new discussion with President Erdogan about the problems he has raised,"" Niinistö said. But NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attempted to allay concerns about Turkey's stance, saying Sunday the country ""has made it clear that their intention is not to block membership."" Blinken also said Sunday he was ""very confident that we will reach consensus."" In the meantime, both countries will have to rely on its current allies and partners for security guarantees, rather than Article 5 -- the clause which states an attack against one NATO nation is an attack against all, and which triggers a collective response in that event. Sweden and Finland have received assurances of support from the United States and Germany should they come under attack, while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed mutual security agreements with his Finnish and Swedish counterparts last week. What does NATO membership entail? The reason most countries join NATO is because of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which stipulates that all signatories consider an attack on one an attack against all. Article 5 has been a cornerstone of the alliance since NATO was founded in 1949 as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. The point of the treaty, and Article 5 specifically, was to deter the Soviets from attacking liberal democracies that lacked military strength. Article 5 guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance -- including the massive US military -- can be used to protect any single member nation, such as smaller countries who would be defenseless without their allies. Iceland, for example, has no standing army. Former Swedish leader Carl Bildt told CNN he doesn't see new big military bases being built in either country should they join NATO. He said that joining the alliance would likely mean more joint military training and planning between Finland, Sweden and NATO's 30 current members. Swedish and Finnish forces could also participate in other NATO operations around the globe, such as those in the Baltic states, where several bases have multinational troops. ""There's going to be preparations for contingencies as part of deterring any adventures that the Russians might be thinking of,"" Bildt said. ""The actual change is going to be fairly limited."" Why haven't Finland and Sweden already joined NATO? While other Nordic countries like Norway, Denmark and Iceland were original members of the alliance, Sweden and Finland did not join the pact for historic and geopolitical reasons. Both Finland, which declared independence from Russia in 1917 after the Bolshevik revolution, and Sweden adopted neutral foreign policy stances during the Cold War, refusing to align with the Soviet Union or the United States. Sweden's policy of neutrality goes back to the early 1800s, when the country steadfastly stayed out of European conflicts. Its King Gustav XIV formally adopted that neutral status in 1834, according to NATO, and Sweden declared a policy of ""non-belligerency"" during World War II -- allowing Nazi troops to pass through its land into Finland, while also accepting Jewish refugees. Sweden opted to maintain its neutral status after the war ended. Finland's neutrality has historically proved more difficult, as it shared a massive border with an authoritarian superpower. A Finno-Soviet treaty known as the Agreement of Friendship, signed in 1948 and extended on occasion through the decades, prohibited Finland from joining any military alliance considered hostile to the USSR, or from allowing a Western attack through Finnish territory. To keep the peace, Finns adopted a process some call ""Finlandization,"" in which leaders acceded to Soviet demands from time to time. The term was coined during the Cold War and has been applied to other countries in which a superpower exerts control over smaller neighboring states. Both countries' balancing acts effectively ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Sweden and Finland joined the European Union together in 1995 and gradually aligned their defense policies with the West, while still avoiding joining NATO outright. Each country had different reasons for avoiding signing up for NATO pact in tandem with the EU. For Finland, it was more geopolitical. The threat for Russia is more tangible thanks to the two countries' shared 830-mile border. ""Finland has been the exposed country, and we've been the protected country,"" Bildt told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in a joint interview alongside former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb. While an independent nation, Sweden's geography puts it in the same ""strategic environment"" as its liberal democratic neighbors, Bildt said. Finland and Sweden have enjoyed a close partnership for decades, with Stockholm viewing its decision to refrain from joining NATO as a way to help keep the heat off Helsinki. Now, however, Sweden is likely to follow Finland's lead. ""We share the idea that close cooperation will benefit both of us,"" current Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said at a news conference last month alongside her Finnish counterpart Marin. How Russia's invasion changed everything Sweden and Finland have been inching towards the West on security issues since joining the EU in 1995, shortly after the end of the Cold War. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine dramatically accelerated that process, pushing Sweden and Finland to pull the trigger on NATO membership. If the Kremlin was willing to invade Ukraine -- a country with 44 million people, a GDP of about $516 million, and an armed forces of 200,000 active troops -- what would stop Putin from invading smaller countries like Finland in Sweden? ""Everything changed when Russia invaded Ukraine,"" Finnish premier Marin said in April. ""People's mindset in Finland, also in Sweden changed and shifted very dramatically."" Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, public support for joining NATO in Finland has leaped from around 30% to nearly 80% in some polls. The majority of Swedes also approve of their country joining the alliance, according to opinion polls there. ""Our NATO membership was decided on the 24th of February, at 5 o'clock in the morning, when Putin and Russia attacked Ukraine"" former Finnish leader Stubb told CNN. ""Finland and Sweden would not have joined without this attack."" Officials in both Sweden and Finland have also expressed frustration that, in the lead-up to the war in Ukraine, Russia attempted to demand security guarantees from NATO that the alliance stop expanding eastward. Such a concession, however, would have effectively given Russia the power to dictate the foreign policies of its neighbors by taking away their ability to choose their own allies and partners. Russia, Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist told CNN, wants ""real influence in the security choices in Europe."" ""They want an influence over the countries in the neighborhood. And that is totally unacceptable for Sweden."" How has Russia reacte",29,0.4184741660117773,6.580935988410524,-6.162461822398747,13
2022-05-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/europe/russia-ukraine-drone-satellite-pontoon-bridges-cmd-intl/index.html,A meandering river in eastern Ukraine is hindering both sides in the war,"The war in Ukraine will soon be three months old. Russia's forces are still well short of the minimum objectives set out by President Vladimir Putin and in many areas the front lines are beginning to look static. But after weeks of intense bombardment, the Ukrainians' defensive lines in the east are also degraded. Essentially, two battlegrounds are emerging. The Russians are adding combat power to their drive to take the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. The Ukrainians are trying both to hold them back and to cut them off. It's a three-dimensional chessboard of military calculation. And the natural boundaries shaped by one river in eastern Ukraine are already affecting the progress of each side. Russian forces have taken territory -- but in modest amounts. Many of their gains, especially in the south, came in the early days of the invasion, and they have tried to consolidate those. At the epicenter of the conflict -- in the industrial belt of Luhansk region -- they have resorted to blanket bombardment. As one Ukrainian official put it: ""The Russians do not change tactics: They destroy cities and only then enter the scorched earth."" Russian ground forces are -- for now -- taking no more than incremental territory, while anecdotal reports speak of poor discipline and morale among some units. Russia still has just under 100 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) in Ukraine, according to US officials, and another 20 just over the border. Each BTG has about 1,000 soldiers, but US officials assess that many have been degraded by more than two months of conflict. In Luhansk and Donetsk -- the goals of Russia's ""special military operation'""-- no city has yet fallen into Russian control beyond Mariupol. That may be about to change after weeks of remorseless shelling of the industrial belt of Luhansk, a string of towns that includes Severodonetsk and Rubizhne. It now seems that Ukrainian resistance in Rubizhne is effectively over. Left behind is a landscape of rubble, without water, power or people. Its occupiers -- mainly Chechen fighters and the militia of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic -- inherit a wasteland. But the loss of Rubizhne does make neighboring Severodonetsk, which was a city of 100,000 people before the invasion and where 15,000 now cower in basements, more vulnerable. And if Ukrainian resistance there is no longer tenable, new defensive lines will be needed to impede a Russian advance westwards. However, the Russian offensive from the north has been much less successful. Which is where the meandering Siverskyi Donets comes into play. The river starts in Russia and flows into Ukraine, forming swamps, floodplains and oxbow lakes, cutting through chalk cliffs as it goes. In other words: a nightmare for a military assault. The Russians have tried and apparently failed to put several pontoons across the river in an effort to encircle Ukrainian troops. Satellite imagery analyzed by CNN shows at least three bridges were destroyed this week and the Russians sustained heavy losses. Further west, the Russians do appear to have crossed the river -- but it's too early to tell if that's in sustainable and sufficient numbers. In the last month, since occupying Izium, they have made only limited progress despite the stretched Ukrainian lines. And their strategic goal -- Sloviansk -- has defenses in depth. To sustain an offensive in this area, the Russian military needs supplies, and they must come from across the border. The supply line runs from Belgorod to the Ukrainian rail hub of Kupiansk and further south. Ukrainian forces seem determined to disrupt this funnel and have made progress in retaking territory to the north and east of Kharkiv. In the first instance, this has reduced Russian fire on the city itself. And in some places Ukrainian units are now in sight of the Russian border, and have Russian supply lines within artillery range. Video geolocated by CNN showed that several top-of-the-line Russian T90M tanks were destroyed as Ukrainian units pushed east towards the Siverskyi Donets. They now control the town of Staryi Saltiv, according to a CNN team that was in the deserted town Thursday. Again the river is a natural obstacle -- and in this area it might hamper further Ukrainian progress. But the Ukrainian counter-offensive has already led the Russians to pull some units back to protect their western flank and hold as many as 20 BTGs back in Belgorod. As Mick Ryan, a former US major general puts it, the Ukrainians ""have placed Russia commanders upon the 'horns of a dilemma' as they slowly deplete their combat power in the east."" But Ryan doesn't expect a more ambitious Ukrainian offensive, which would sap already stretched resources. ""The Ukrainians will probably continue their continuous 'nibbling away' at the Russians to seize back their territory, rather than a general offensive on all fronts,"" he tweeted. The south: A very different war The picture is less dynamic in the south, where the front lines have moved little. The Russians still control a substantial belt of farmland in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, but their efforts to move further north have been sporadic. In Kherson, for example, public unrest has subsided -- partly because an estimated 45% of the region's population is reported to have left. The Russians continue to launch cruise missile attacks on Odesa and other coastal regions, without much purpose beyond terrorizing the civilian population and with little ""operational design"" in military language. Any effort to attack the city from land or sea seems very implausible, especially since the sinking of Russia's guided-missile cruiser, the Moskva. US intelligence discounts any imminent prospect that Russian forces would try to seize all of Ukraine's coast. That would likely require a full mobilization inside Russia, a step Putin has so far not ordered. Instead, the Russians seems intent on consolidating their control over a land corridor running from the border to Crimea and trying to ""integrate"" Kherson into the ""Russian world"" by introducing Russian passports, the ruble and a puppet administration. But their proxies are ruling over areas in grim conditions, with healthcare and utilities severely impaired. And there is plenty of evidence that Russian units are treating the region as a candy store, stealing everything from tractors to museum artifacts. As yet there is no serious effort at governing. A war of attrition Few expect a knock-out blow by either side in the coming months. A war of attrition looks more likely as the weapons supplied by the US and its allies tilt the balance on the battlefield. The first American howitzers on now on the front lines. The US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, said this week that ""as both Russia and Ukraine believe they can continue to make progress militarily, we do not see a viable negotiating path forward, at least in the short term."" ""The uncertain nature of the battle, which is developing into a war of attrition, combined with the reality that Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia's current conventional military capabilities, likely means the next few months could see us moving along a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory."" Perhaps the greatest risk for Ukraine is that a war like this -- along essentially the same fronts that we see today -- would be sustainable, if tough, for Russia. However, it would hammer the Ukrainian economy, which is already expected to shrink by 45% this year, according to the World Bank. Putin could then wait for an opportunity to take a further bite out of a country that he believes has no right to exist. There is the additional risk -- if not yet evident -- that the West's sense of urgency in backing Ukraine with cash and weapons might wane should the conflict settle into stagnation. Remember Syria. But the course of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has already defied most expectations. The time is approaching when critical decisions -- or mistakes -- by either side may well influence its outcome. In the words of the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu: ""The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.""",14,7.8078735671057276,2.1570882484130953,5.650785318692632,21
2022-05-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/world/russia-general-ukraine-syria-cluster-bombs-intl-cmd/index.html,Exclusive: Russian general who oversaw atrocities in Syria led cluster bomb attacks on civilians in Ukraine,"As she fetched drinking water for her family on a sunny but cold afternoon in late February, Margarita Kiriukhina tried to ignore the booms and thuds of Russian shelling nearby. In the line, with two flasks in hand, she attempted to lighten the mood, cracking jokes with her neighbors as they waited for their turn at the water dispenser. Despite the horrors befalling their city after Russia invaded Ukraine, they filed along in an orderly fashion. Suddenly, Kiriukhina heard a whistling sound overhead. After glimpsing something out of the corner of her eye, she shouted for everyone to get down. The line was quickly drenched in blood, the air filled with screams. Moscow had just launched one of its notorious 300mm Smerch cluster rockets -- a projectile that unleashes 72 submunitions over an area the size of a football pitch -- hitting Kiriukhina and her neighbors. The torrent of shrapnel cut Kiriukhina's leg, hand and forehead. A man nearby lost two of his fingers. ""I could feel that my leg and my hip got ruptured. My arm got hit and I couldn't feel my head,"" Kiriukhina told CNN. The 56-year-old was taken to hospital in a wheel barrow and was hospitalized for ten days. Video uploaded to social media showed a woman putting on a brave face as her leg bled out. A severed foot lay a couple of meters away. Another woman fashioned a tourniquet out of a dog collar -- hopelessly -- trying to save the injured woman, according to eyewitness testimony. They were not the only Smerch rockets fired into Kharkiv over a key 48-hour period in late February, as Russian troops battled to seize the city from Ukrainian forces. And Ukraine is not the first battleground where Russian forces have deployed cluster munitions to devastating effect against civilians. To survivors of Syria's yearslong civil war, the scenes in Kharkiv echo countless others carried out by Russia after it intervened to aid President Bashar al-Assad in 2015. Through analysis of satellite imagery in collaboration with the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) and on-the-ground investigations, CNN has identified the rocket artillery brigade that launched the cluster munitions attack in residential districts of Ukraine's second city on the day Kiriukhina and her neighbors were attacked. That brigade reports directly to same military leader -- Colonel General Alexander Zhuravlyov -- who oversaw one of the most brutal chapters of Syria's war. CNN traced 11 Smerch rockets that landed in Kharkiv on February 27 and February 28 back to Russia's 79th Rocket Artillery Brigade, based in Russia's Belgorod region. That brigade reports directly to the leadership of the Russian military's Western Military District (WMD), one of five military districts in the Russian military, based in the western part of Russia. Multiple military experts told CNN that Zhuravlyov -- the Russian equivalent of a theater commander in the US military -- is the only officer with the authority to order a Smerch rocket attack in his district. As a high-value weapon, it needs senior sign-off. The Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense have not responded to CNN's request for comment. Lessons from Syria Zhuravlyov, 57, was commissioned as a Soviet officer in the 1980s when he served in the former Czechoslovakia with a group of Russian forces. After the USSR collapsed, he returned to Russia, initially serving with tank units. Deployed to Syria three times, he first became the commander of Russian troops in the country during his second stint in July 2016. Before he assumed the post, Moscow was mired in a bloody fight to capture rebel-held eastern Aleppo, making steady advances against the armed opposition. Zhuravlyov's leadership catalyzed the assault on eastern Aleppo. After he took the reins, the Russian military rapidly ramped up its attacks on the rebel-held territory and completed the siege of the densely populated city, exacting a large death toll and setting the wheels in motion for a tactic that has defined Russia's intervention in Syria: besiege, starve, bombard and grind into submission. His period of command also saw a dramatic increase in documented cluster munition attacks in Aleppo. According to the Violations Documentation Center, which documents human rights violations in Syria, cluster munitions were used 137 times in Aleppo between September 10 and October 10, 2016, a 791% increase on the average number of cluster munition attacks in the previous eight months. In 2015, Russia's Defense Ministry denied using cluster munitions in Syria. It was an escalation which aid groups sought to draw the world's attention to. At the time, Save the Children's then-Syria director, Sonia Khush, said in a statement: ""there are young children with freshly amputated limbs or with ball bearings embedded in their muscle tissue because of the use of these appalling and indiscriminate weapons."" In Kharkiv, CNN spoke to dozens of eyewitnesses in several of the neighborhoods targeted by 11 Smerch rocket attacks that occurred on February 27 and 28. They recalled the death and destruction that the cluster munitions wrought on their city. The streets were covered with wounded people, burning cars and broken glass. One eyewitness said that up to a dozen people were injured in his apartment building alone in a single Smerch rocket attack. ""I don't know what exactly this was, but it was all over the district. These small bits that explode and spread dangerous shrapnel all over,"" said Yuriy Braiko, an IT program analyst who lives in Kharkiv. ""They create a lot of tiny shrapnel which gets into various places, windows and people."" Rocket remnants seen in Kharkiv by CNN and the burn marks left by the projectiles revealed the incoming direction of the attack, which CNN traced back to Russia's Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. CNN visited a site where Ukrainian officials had collected large piles of exploded and unexploded ordnance. Mark Hiznay, a weapons expert and the associate arms director for Human Rights Watch, reviewed images from the site and said the photographs indicated that the cluster munition attacks had happened at a scale not seen in years. ""There are a lot of cluster munitions used in a scale that was probably beyond what we saw in south Lebanon in 2006,"" Hiznay said, referring to the 2006 war between Lebanon and Israel, during which the Israeli military dropped an estimated 4 million submunitions on south Lebanon, according to the United Nations. ""It's not like the movies where you see the missile before the bomb hits. You'll just all of a sudden have 72 submunitions detonating across a football pitch,"" said Hiznay. ""So that's why people are literally cut down in midstride from these things. You don't have a lot of burns. You don't have blast injuries. It's just nasty, bloody fragmentation."" Cluster bombs are banned under an international treaty — the 2010 Convention on Cluster Munitions — that prohibits the use, transfer, production and stockpiling of the weapons. The treaty cites the failure of many submunitions to explode on impact, leaving dangerous ordnance in fields and urban areas that could kill or maim people. Russia, Ukraine, the United States and Israel are among the countries who are not signatories to the treaty. But an attack of any kind that indiscriminately attacks civilians, as CNN's on-the-ground investigation reveals happened on February 27 and 28, would appear to be a war crime, according to multiple experts interviewed. ""The extrajudicial murders and the bombardment of the civilian population, that is neither a military necessity nor proportional to the threat they are facing, are against the Geneva Conventions,"" said Foreign Policy Research Institute fellow Philip Wasielewski. ""And based on the Geneva Conventions standard of command responsibility, General (Zhuravlyov) is culpable as well as anyone else in his chain of command."" 'The wounds are the same' A doctor who treated the war wounded in both conflicts has been struck by the similarities. People arrived at the Kharkiv hospital pockmarked with shrapnel, skin and muscle damage, amputations, open fractures and head trauma. Syrian-American orthopedic surgeon Dr. Samer Attar, who worked in Aleppo as Zhuravlyov's forces besieged the city, travelled to Ukraine from his hometown of Chicago hoping to help Ukrainian doctors cope with the unfamiliar tide of traumatized war-wounded. Attar described the wounds he treated in Kharkiv and those he saw in Aleppo in 2016 as ""the same."" ""You can hear the air-raid sirens but everyone here has learned to remain still and steadfast and carry on,"" he said. ""It never stops outside and neither does the work."" In December 2016, the rebels who were holed up in eastern Aleppo finally surrendered and Syrian government and Russian forces recaptured the territory. With the end of the battle for Aleppo, Zhuravlyov left the helm of the Russian military in Syria and returned to Russia. He was awarded the highest honors bestowed on a Russian officer -- the Hero of the Russian Federation. He was twice promoted the following year and became commander of the Western Military District -- the same division that wreaked death and destruction on Kharkiv and other parts of Ukraine -- shortly after his third stint in Syria in 2018. ""The results Zhuravlyov achieved in Syria were exactly what the Russians wanted, hence his reward with the top medal and the top postings one can get,"" said Russian military expert Wasielewski. ""It's what Napoleon said: 'a general's reward is not a bigger tent but a bigger command.'"" Zhuravlyov later said in an interview that Syria had taught him about the value of ""military ingenuity,"" and that the lessons learned there were being integrated as an ""organic component"" of all Russian military training. Another Russian general who served in Syria alongside Zhuravlyov -- Lieutenant General Aleksei Zavizion -- was appointed Zhuravlyov's deputy in the Western Military District in the same month Zhuravlyov assumed his current position. Just a year before, Zavizion had allegedly led a group of separatist fighters after they wrested territory from Ukrainian government forces in the country's eastern-most Donbas region, according to Ukraine's military intelligence. Ukraine's military intelligence also accuses Zavizion of being behind multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) attacks on civilian areas in the Donbas region. In 2017, Ukraine indicted Zavizion for alleged war crimes. CNN cross-referenced its findings regarding the two Russian generals with Ukraine's military intelligence who confirmed that they have accused the men of being responsible for apparent crimes against civilians in Kharkiv and elsewhere. Neither Zhuravlyov nor Zavizion have been sanctioned by the international community. ""Colonel General Alexander Zhuravlyov should have been sa",14,3.5229657900228424,7.39379091058479,-3.8708251205619475,15
2022-05-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/europe/finland-leaders-join-nato-intl/index.html,"Finland's leaders announce support for NATO membership, sparking retaliation threats from Russia","Finland's president and prime minister announced their support for joining NATO on Thursday, moving the Nordic nation which shares an 800-mile border with Russia one step closer to membership of the US-led military alliance. The Kremlin has responded by saying the move would be a threat to Russia and warned of possible retaliation. The statement of support for NATO from President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin had been expected, after the Finnish government recently submitted a report on national security to the country's parliament which outlined the path to joining the alliance as one of Finland's options. In the joint statement, Niinisto and Marin said: ""NATO membership would strengthen Finland's security. As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay. We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days."" Later on Thursday, Russia's Foreign Ministry said the Finnish statement marked a ""radical change in the country's foreign policy"" and warned of countermeasures. ""Helsinki must be aware of the responsibility and consequences of such a move,"" said the ministry. Finland's possible accession to NATO would cause serious damage to bilateral Russian-Finnish relations, which are maintaining stability and security in the Northern European region, the ministry said. ""Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to stop the threats to its national security that arise in this regard,"" it said. Also on Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Finland joining the alliance would not contribute to more security. ""As we have said many times before, NATO expansion does not make the world more stable and secure,"" Peskov told reporters. He added that Russia's reaction would depend on NATO activity near its borders. ""It will depend on what this expansion process will entail, how far and how close to our borders the military infrastructure will move,"" Peskov said. The spokesperson added that Russia will analyze the situation with Finland's entry to NATO and will work out the necessary measures to ensure its own security. Peskov also told reporters on a regular conference call that: ""Everyone wants to avoid a direct clash between Russia and NATO: both Russia and NATO, and, most importantly, Washington."" He added, however, that Russia will be ready to give ""the most decisive response"" to those who would try to get involved in the country's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine -- the Kremlin's official euphemism for Russia's war there. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, public support for joining NATO in Finland has leaped from around 30% to nearly 80% in some polls. The move would require approval by Finland's parliament and the clearance of any other domestic legislative hurdles, but NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said that the country would be ""warmly welcomed"" into the alliance if it applies for membership. ""I welcome the joint statement by President Niinisto and Prime Minister Marin supporting an application for NATO membership without delay,"" Stoltenberg said Thursday, according to his office. ""This is a sovereign decision by Finland, which NATO fully respects. Should Finland decide to apply, they would be warmly welcomed into NATO, and the accession process would be smooth and swift. Finland is one of NATO's closest partners, a mature democracy, a member of the European Union, and an important contributor to Euro-Atlantic security,"" he said. The NATO chief said he agreed with Niinisto and Marin, ""that NATO membership would strengthen both NATO and Finland's security."" It is also expected that Sweden, Finland's neighbor to the west, will soon announce its intention to join the alliance through a similar process. Russia has previously warned both countries against joining NATO, saying there would be consequences. European diplomats and security officials widely assume that Finland could join the alliance quickly once negotiations start, as it has been buying military hardware compatible with its Western allies, including the US, for decades and already meets many of the criteria for membership. Finland joining NATO would have both practical and symbolic consequences for Russia and the Western alliance. Since the end of World War II, Finland has been militarily non-aligned and nominally neutral in order to avoid provoking Russia. It has indulged the Kremlin's security concerns at times and tried to maintain good trading relations. The war in Ukraine, however, has sufficiently changed the calculation, so that joining NATO now seems the best way forward, regardless of what Russia's reaction might be. European defense officials who have talked to CNN in recent months assume that NATO countries will offer some guarantees around Finland's security during the accession process, in case Russia retaliates before it has formally joined. On Wednesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new security pacts with Finland and Sweden, pledging to come to either country's assistance if one of them came under attack. Finland has historically had high defense spending and still has a policy of conscription, with all adult men liable to be called up for military service. It is widely acknowledged among NATO officials that Finland joining the alliance would be a significant boost in countering Russian aggression because of how seriously the country has historically treated its own security. It also shares more than 800 miles of border with Russia, which is significant as the Kremlin stated before invading Ukraine that it wanted to see NATO roll back its borders to where they were in the 1990s. Instead, President Vladimir Putin's gambit may result in a stronger NATO creeping closer.",29,8.208146231517766,4.268248400857616,3.9398978306601498,9
2022-05-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/10/politics/lithuanian-foreign-minister-interview/index.html,Lithuanian foreign minister says Putin and Russian regime must be removed to stop 'warmongering',"Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said the removal of not only Vladimir Putin, but the entire regime that supports him, is necessary to stop Russia's ""warmongering"" and predicted the Kremlin leader will become increasingly erratic as his battlefield losses grow in Ukraine. Speaking to CNN in Washington on Tuesday, Landsbergis also said his nation is seeking a permanent US troop presence, calling it ""the biggest deterrent to an aggressor like Russia,"" as well as fortified support from NATO at next month's leaders' summit in Madrid. Lithuania has been a strong supporter of Ukraine since the start of the war more than two months ago and has pushed for a robust response to counter Russia, becoming the first country in the European Union to stop Russian gas imports. Landsbergis said the United States and European allies have thus far been focused on their ""tactical approach"" to the war in Ukraine, responding to the developments on the ground. However, the foreign minister stressed that they also need to think strategically about the longer-term -- and until Putin and his enablers are gone, the world needs to be prepared that Russia ""might war again, and not excluding NATO countries."" ""There are countries that are expecting that we just have to wait it out and kind of wait for the war to be over and then we'll get back to the business as usual,"" Landsbergis said, who argued that ""Russia is out of the civilized world order ... they no longer belong in this."" ""Russia's warmongering state will be over when the regime is over in Russia. That's the only way that we see it,"" he said. Landsbergis did not suggest the West should take concrete action to remove Putin from power and acknowledged that ""it might take quite some time for it to change, because we don't have any active means to change it. So it needs to change from within."" Moreover, Landsbergis explained it would not be enough just for Putin to no longer lead Russia because ""it's a whole system."" ""Putin might be sick, he might be pushed aside by his inner circle -- who's probably quite unhappy about the losses in the battlefield -- but that doesn't mean that the regime will change or its attitude, the war mongering attitude will change,"" he said, saying it was reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Landsbergis told CNN that Putin's Victory Day speech on Monday suggested there may be discontent among that inner circle about Russia's failures in the war, saying it was ""fascinating"" that the Russian President ""tried to explain"" why he started the war in those remarks. ""Who he is explaining it to? His public? Well, they don't need explanation,"" the foreign minister said, noting the general Russian public's approval of the invasion. ""Us? You know, we don't believe him. I mean, we know the facts, you know, we knew them all along."" ""So my guess would be that he's explaining it to his circle ... people who might lose trust in him. So he has to rally them that this was a good decision,"" Landsbergis said. The top Lithuanian diplomat predicted that Putin ""will become more and more paranoid as to who he can trust, and he will feel that there is more and more discontent growing around him due to the losses on the battlefield, and that might make his moves -- especially within the (inner) circle -- more erratic."" Such erratic behavior could lead him to strike a NATO country, which is why ""NATO's decisions are so vital to countries like Lithuania"" -- one of the geographically closest NATO nations to Russia. ""We have to know that we are protected,"" Landsbergis said. Landsbergis told CNN that addressing such security concerns was a key topic of his meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Monday in Washington, and will be a focus of discussions with the NATO leaders discuss the eastern flank at the Madrid summit in June. Landsbergis said Lithuania wants a permanent troop presence on the ""Suwalki corridor"" -- which sits on Lithuanian-Polish border and links Belarus to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad in the Baltics -- a permanent US troop presence, and the possibility for allies to send a brigade-level deployment. Landsbergis also said Lithuania seeks integrated air defense capabilities, similar to Israel's Iron Dome. Landsbergis told CNN that his country hasn't gotten a clear answer from Washington about where it stands on a permanent US troop presence, but hopes there will be consensus when NATO meets next month. Ahead of that summit, Landsbergis said it was important that the world face the ""looming food crisis"" as a result of the war, calling it ""a huge problem that's just beginning to reveal itself."" ""This is also where this global alliance needs to put a lot of effort,"" he said. ""One of the things that could be done, and I think that the main thing that should be done, is providing a possibility for Ukrainians to export their wheat and corn through Odesa port and providing a security corridor if need be. And that could be done by the countries who are affected by the food crisis -- take Egypt,"" Landsbergis told CNN. He said he did not foresee NATO itself playing a role in providing a security corridor, but ""I would not exclude the fact that maybe some of the NATO countries would take part in this, together with broader allies, with the countries who are directly affected by this."" ""That because if you see the list of the countries who were buying food products from Ukraine, and who are now in the vulnerable position, so take Turkey, take Egypt, even Iran -- and I don't expect that Iran would be joining the effort -- still there are tens of millions people who will be in a vulnerable state, and some of them will be suffering because of the food prices and shortages.""",29,1.7259255524824593,5.142861359959422,-3.416935807476963,20

The Crimean human rights activist and nurse disappeared on her way home from work in the Russian-annexed peninsula more than a week ago. She has not been seen since. Danylovich is believed to have been detained by Russian authorities, but they have refused to say whether, where or by whom she is being held. ""We assume that she is still in jail,"" Danylovich's lawyer Aider Azamatov told CNN. Danylovich's father Bronislav told the news site Krym.Realii, a Radio Liberty affiliate, that his daughter planned to take public transport home on the morning of April 29, after finishing her shift at a medical facility in Koktebel, south-eastern Crimea. Azamatov said the nurse stopped answering her phone at that point. At around the same time, Azamatov said, balaclava-clad officials from the Russian special police unit came to the house Danylovich shares with her parents in the village of Vladislavovka, near Feodosiya. Vladislavovka is about 34 kilometers (21 miles) from Koktebel. He told CNN that the officials who searched the family's house told her father she had been sentenced to 10 days of administrative arrest for ""the transfer of unclassified information to a foreign state."" But the authorities have refused to hand over a copy of the decision, according to Azamatov. He has still not seen any official documents regarding Danylovich's arrest. He has not been allowed access to his client. ""Iryna does not have a procedural status, which is why they hide her from me,"" he said. Azamatov, Danylovich's family and several human rights organizations have been searching for her at detention centers in multiple cities in Crimea ever since her disappearance. Azamatov said he has checked seven pre-trial detention centers and special detention centers across the region himself, with no luck. Crimean authorities have refused to comment. The officer on duty at the prosecutor's office for Russian-occupied Crimea referred CNN to authorities in Danylovich's hometown. When CNN reached the police station in Feodosiya on Tuesday, the person who answered the call said they knew nothing about the case and hung up. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russian-occupied Crimea did not respond to a written request for comment. A phone number listed on its website is not reachable. On May 6 -- Danylovich's 43rd birthday -- human rights activists left gifts outside one of the detention centers, even as they were told she was not being held there. Through her work as a citizen journalist, Danylovich has exposed problems in Crimea's health care system, including in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. She has written for a number of Ukrainian media outlets and has published her findings on Facebook. ""The abduction of Iryna Danylovich has signs of enforced disappearance under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance,"" Zmina, a Ukrainian human rights NGO, said in a statement. The term enforced disappearance describes disappearances either perpetrated by state actors or by others acting on behalf of, or with the support of, state authorities, followed by a refusal to disclose the person's fate and whereabouts. Because the authorities refuse to acknowledge detention, the victim doesn't have any legal protection and perpetrators are rarely prosecuted, according to the UN. The UN says the practice is often used as a strategy to spread terror within the society. Other than telling Danylovich's father verbally during the search that his daughter was arrested, the authorities have never officially acknowledged her detention or provided any reason for her to be held. ""As of May 7, the ninth day after she went missing, [nothing is known] about where Iryna Danylovich stays and in what status,"" Zmina added. Danylovich's case is the latest in a string of disappearances of activists, journalists and ordinary citizens reported over the last decade in Crimea. According to a report published in March 2021, the UN Human Rights Office documented at least 43 cases of enforced disappearances in Crimea between 2014 and 2018. The UN said they were mostly abductions and kidnappings and that some of the victims -- 39 men and four women -- had been subjected to ill treatment and torture. Eleven of the men remained missing, and one man remained in detention at the time of the report. The UN said they had not been able to document any prosecutions in relation to any of the cases. Azamatov said Danylovich's parents told him that the people who entered their home were wearing civilian clothes; none of them introduced themselves or showed ID. Instead they read out the warrant and began searching different rooms at the same time, the couple said. They said the officials confiscated all electronic equipment, including three phones that no longer work, and several books, including a publication by Viktor Suvorov. Suvorov, whose real name is Vladimir Bogdanovich Rezun, is a former Soviet spy who defected to the UK and reinvented himself as an author of books about World War II. Danylovich's parents told Azamatov that the officers refused to leave them a copy of the list of seized items or a copy of the report of the search. On May 2, Azamatov appealed to the authorities and Danylovich's parents filed a statement to the police. ""My appeals to the Prosecutor's Office of Crimea, to the Military Prosecutor's Office, to the Military Investigative Committee and to the Investigative Committee of Russia have not yet been answered. There is an appeal to the police from the father, there is no answer yet,"" Azamatov said. Bronislav Danylovich said he had seen a security video which appeared to show the moment his daughter was abducted. He told Krym.Realii that he saw CCTV footage from one of the gas stations on the way out of Koktebel showed a woman, in clothes similar to the ones Danylovich was wearing when she disappeared, standing at a bus stop. He said the clip showed a black car drive up, several people in civilian clothes jump out and -- despite the woman's resistance -- push her into the vehicle. Azamatov told CNN the gas station refused to hand over the footage and that after seeing the video, Bronislav Danylovich filed a new statement with the police demanding that a criminal case be opened. ""Now we are waiting for a video from the place of her abduction, they promised to provide it so that I could study it,"" Azamatov said. Meanwhile, a group of 19 human rights institutions is appealing to agencies and officials at the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the European Union to help in Danylovich's case. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has urged Russian authorities in Crimea to ""immediately come forward with any information regarding Danylovich's whereabouts and let the media work freely."" Gulnoza Said, CPJ's Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, said in a statement. ""Iryna Danylovich's alarming disappearance prompts fears of yet another clampdown on independent reporting in Russian-occupied Crimea, which is already an extremely restrictive environment for the press.""",13,7.759567878983301,5.9510553974806655,1.8085124815026354,6
2022-05-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/10/europe/finland-nato-putin-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html,Finland is on the verge of asking to join NATO. Here's why that's bad news for Putin,"Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has backfired on a number of fronts. But one of the most disastrous consequences of all for the Russian President is the increasingly likely prospect of Finland joining NATO. The Nordic nation is expected to announce its interest in NATO membership as soon as this week after its Foreign Affairs Committee drafts a response to the government's security report -- which includes the option of joining the alliance. After that, the Finnish parliament will hold an extraordinary debate on whether to approve the security report recommendations. At this point it is very likely NATO would invite the country to talk about accession to the alliance. It is broadly believed this would happen very quickly, as Finland already meets most of the criteria and it's highly unlikely any NATO members would object. Multiple recent opinion polls have shown that at least 60% of Finns are now in favor of NATO membership, a huge jump from a previous high of around 30% in past years. If this plays out as expected, this country of under 6 million people will have redrawn the European security map in a way that was previously inconceivable and may have tremendous consequences for Russia. Before Putin invaded Ukraine, he made clear his belief that NATO had edged too close to Russia and should be stripped back to its borders of the 1990s, before some countries that either neighbor Russia or were ex-Soviet states joined the military alliance. Russia currently shares about 755 miles of land border with five NATO members, according to the alliance. Finland's accession would mean that a nation with which Russia shares an 800-mile border would become formally militarily aligned with the United States. Not only would this be bad news for the Kremlin, but the addition of Finland would be quite a boon for NATO. Despite its relatively small population, Finland is a serious military power that has been unofficially aligned with the West for decades. Its military has for decades used equipment purchased from the United States that is compatible with NATO allies, meaning it could easily join NATO missions should it choose to do so. 'Survival' ideology Many believe the only reason Finland hadn't joined the alliance prior to the Ukraine crisis was simple pragmatism. ""Finnish security has always been based on two concepts: first geography and history; second idealism and realism,"" Alexander Stubb, a former Prime Minister of Finland, told CNN. ""In an ideal world we want to cooperate with Russia, which we cannot escape being our geographical neighbor. But we also know from history that the greatest realistic threat to our national security is Russia. Over time, the reality that Russia is willing to create greater chaos in our region has become even clearer, so joining NATO becomes the pragmatic option,"" he said. Historically, Finland has navigated these competing realities by simultaneously indulging Russia's security concerns, however irrational they may be, while also maintaining high defense spending and a standing military that is compatible with Western allies. ""It's always been bonkers, the idea that a Western country would invade Russia, but we have tried to minimize those concerns by boosting trade and cooperating in other areas,"" said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a leading researcher in global security at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. He adds, however, that on top of policies like conscription -- all Finnish men are liable to be called up for military service -- and high defense spending, Finnish politicians have consistently sold to the public the idea that Finland's idealistic way of life must be maintained at all costs. ""Finland's default ideology has been one of survival. In the past 100 years we have become a strong, sovereign country with high standards of living. We have had to sacrifice land in order to maintain peace,"" Salonius-Pasternak said. ""It is therefore vitally important that our way of life survives, whether that is by pragmatic diplomacy or taking a harder stance against our greatest threat."" There is no doubt that Finland joining NATO would be a major blow to Putin. Not only would it mean those extra 800 miles of shared border with the alliance, but symbolically it would go further in uniting the anti-Putin coalition that has emerged since the invasion of Ukraine. Countries that were once neutral are now providing funding and arms to Ukraine and Putin is an international pariah with fewer allies by the day. It would also expand NATO's influence in northern Europe all the way up to the Arctic, an area that is becoming increasingly important geopolitically due to its natural resources, strategic location and numerous territorial claims -- including by Russia, Finland and the US. Sweden, which neighbors Finland to the west, is also considering joining the alliance -- and Finland's accession would make it all the more likely, as the two countries have been on a similar journey since the start of the Ukraine crisis. Russian response Of course, there are concerns over how Russia might react to Finland expressing its desire to join NATO. Martti Kari, who previously served as Finland's assistant chief of defense intelligence, told CNN that Russia is already starting a misinformation campaign against it. ""The main theme is that Finland is a Nazi country, because we fought against [the] Soviet Union in the Second World War alongside of Nazi Germany,"" he said. He predicts that Russia could violate Finland's airspace and disrupt its activities at sea, including shipping, as well as upping its intelligence operations against the country. Håkon Lunde Saxi, an associate professor at the Norwegian Defence University College, thinks that any move toward Finnish NATO membership would ""probably result in a Russian military build-up along NATO's new border with Russia, which would in itself not be beneficial for Finnish or European security."" However, he believes that the benefits would by far outweigh the ""possible negative consequences of a somewhat larger Russian military footprint along Finland's border."" And despite concerns over what would happen in the interim period, where Finland would not be protected by NATO membership but would be in negotiations, multiple officials have told CNN that they expect members of the alliance, notably the UK and US, to guarantee Finnish security through this process. Of course, nothing is certain until Finland makes the first move of declaring its intention. But with public approval, political support and Russia providing every reason for another of its neighbors to join its hated rival, there's little doubt that Putin's gambit to decrease NATO'S influence in Europe has backfired, spectacularly.",29,6.307929798054244,5.973020458809447,0.3349093392447964,13
2022-05-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/10/politics/ukraine-russia-cyberattack-satellite-blinken/index.html,US and European allies blame Russia for cyberattack on satellite provider as Ukraine invasion began,"The US, European Union and the UK have blamed Russia for a hack that knocked out internet service for tens of thousands of satellite modems in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe at the onset of Russia's invasion on February 24. ""The United States is joining with allies and partners to condemn Russia's destructive cyber activities against Ukraine,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Tuesday. The cyberattack on a satellite network owned by US-based telecommunications firm Viasat is one of the most consequential cyber incidents of the war in Ukraine. It disrupted communications in Ukraine an hour before Russia's full-scale invasion, according to an EU statement, and the collateral damage included knocking thousands of wind turbines offline in Germany that relied on the satellite network. A top Ukrainian cyber official, Victor Zhora, on March 15 called the hack ""a really huge loss in communications in the very beginning of the war."" The primary target of the hack ""is believed to have been the Ukrainian military,"" the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said Tuesday. Blinken's statement also blamed Russian military hackers for a series of data-wiping hacks on Ukrainian government agencies and companies prior to and after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The hacks before the invasion may been an attempt by the Kremlin to extract concessions from the Ukrainian government, according to Microsoft analysts. The State Department on Tuesday also offered further details on how the US government is trying to help Kyiv ward off a barrage of suspected Russian hacks. Contractors for the US Agency for International Development are ""providing hands-on support"" to Ukrainian government agencies and critical infrastructure to identify malicious software and bring systems back online, the department said. Meanwhile, the FBI has been briefing Ukrainian officials about Russian intelligence services' hacking operations and receiving leads on cyber threats for the FBI to investigate, according to the State Department. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington. The cyberattack was ""yet another example of Russia's continued pattern of irresponsible behaviour in cyberspace, which also formed an integral part of its illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine,"" the European Council, said in a statement.",3,8.18570066302481,7.046657089347726,1.1390435736770845,23
2022-05-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/europe/luhansk-school-bombing-ukraine-russia-intl/index.html,"Dozens feared dead after Russia bombs school where Ukrainians were sheltering, official says","About 60 people are feared dead after a Russian aircraft dropped a bomb on a school in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, where civilians were sheltering on Saturday afternoon, a Ukrainian official said. Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said the school building was destroyed. ""The explosion happened inside the building. Rescuers (are) dismantling the debris as quickly as possible. The chances of finding (anyone still) alive are very small. There were 90 people inside the school building; 27 survived, 60 people most likely died,"" Hayday said. Hayday said a Russian air strike hit the school in the village of Bilohorivka, which is some seven miles from the front lines of the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, at around 4:37 p.m. (9:37 a.m. ET) on Saturday, causing fires to break out that took almost four hours to extinguish. Photos shared from the scene showed rescue personnel searching the smoldering ruins of the school building. Survivors of the bombing described their harrowing experience in interviews with CNN. ""I got slammed down by a slab -- bent into a ball,"" said a man with a bandage across his nose and forehead, who preferred not to give his name out of privacy concerns. ""Then another explosion, small rocks fell on us. Darkness."" He continued: ""There was a woman in our room screaming the whole time. She was pulled out and screaming the whole time. I told her, 'Don't scream.' We couldn't hear a thing."" ""They started digging,"" he said. ""I got out. I was like a drunk man -- lost."" Video of the school shared by Hayday on Telegram shows a building that was completely leveled by the attack. Another survivor, Sergiy, said that he was in the school's basement when the bomb hit and that all three floors of the building collapsed ""to the ground."" ""We didn't understand anything,"" Sergiy said. ""We were inside. All at once, everything fell down. Darkness. That's it."" Yevgen, meanwhile, described a desperate escape. ""I was the very first one to start climbing out,"" he said. ""I was raking bricks and throwing them out. There were wooden planks and boards. Locals who weren't in the basement helped and used a pipe to rip those boards off."" The survivors said that among the neighbors they were sheltering with were several elderly grandparents. ""Imagine what they bombed,"" said Sergiy. ""An ordinary village with only pensioners and children."" United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine and UN Assistant Secretary-General Amin Awad in a statement Sunday called the bombing ""yet another stark reminder of the cruelty of this war."" ""Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be spared in times of war; these obligations under international humanitarian law are non-negotiable,"" Awad said. ""The sooner we seek a peaceful end to the war, the better for the people here in Ukraine and everywhere in the world."" Western countries reacted to the bombing with outrage. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Sunday that she was ""horrified,"" adding: ""Deliberate targeting of civilians & civilian infrastructure amounts to war crimes. We will ensure Putin's regime is held accountable."" Russian forces have struck fleeing or sheltering civilians on numerous occasions since Moscow invaded Ukraine. Schools, nurseries and hospitals have all been targeted by Russia, according to the United Nations. Amnesty International said Friday that Russian forces ""must face justice for a series of war crimes"" committed in the region northwest of Kyiv, following an investigation the group conducted in Ukraine. The investigation, based ""on dozens of interviews and extensive review of material evidence,"" has documented ""unlawful air strikes on Borodyanka, and extrajudicial executions in other towns and villages including Bucha, Andriivka, Zdvyzhivka and Vorzel."" Fighting in Luhansk has been raging for months, and particularly since Russia refocused its invasion on the eastern Donbas region. Hayday said on Ukrainian television on Saturday, hours before the school bombing, that the situation was difficult. ""The biggest efforts made by the enemy are to break through in Popasna and the direction of Severodonetsk and Voievodivka. That's where they deployed the biggest amount of their troops and equipment,"" he said. ""That's where the largest number of shellings and rockets, and air strikes are constant -- it's just a terrible situation. Our guys are holding on, we are waiting for help, for reinforcement,"" he said. This story has been updated with additional information.",17,4.857984858637999,3.7014702956699272,1.1565145629680718,29
2022-05-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/europe/victory-day-russia-ukraine-war-analysis-cmd-intl/index.html,Putin has put himself at the center of Russia's Victory Day. But he has little to celebrate,"President Vladimir Putin takes Russian anniversaries seriously. It was no coincidence that his invasion of Ukraine came a day after Defender of the Fatherland Day, a celebration of Russia's military achievements. It was on that same occasion in 2014 that Putin took the first step in annexing Crimea from Ukraine, through orchestrated pro-Russian protests on the peninsula. The leader had clearly hoped to have more to celebrate by this Victory Day on Monday, the country's most patriotic of dates, marking the Soviet Union's role in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II. It was on May 8, 1945, (May 9 in Moscow's time zone) that Germany signed its Instrument of Surrender in Berlin, ending the fighting in Europe. The USSR suffered the biggest losses of any nation -- around 27 million soldiers and civilians died. Russia's justification for war in Ukraine suggested a deadline for success by Victory Day. Putin and his government have repeatedly said the aim of their so-called ""special operation"" is to ""denazify"" Ukraine, and that freeing the country of Nazis is a matter of Russian survival. It's an argument that has no real weight; a blatant cover for Russian revanchism. Even though the Kremlin's well-oiled propaganda machine has been going at full steam since the February invasion, it will be difficult for Putin to twist Russia's losses into true victory on Monday. If anything, the operation in Ukraine has been an embarrassment for him -- at least on the international stage. Russia's military outsizes Ukraine's by every measure -- even with the heavy weapons the West is sending in -- yet it failed to take territory in the north, let alone the capital, Kyiv, and is struggling to make gains even in the east, where it is now focused. Ukraine's armed forces claim that Russia has lost more than 24,000 troops in just over two months, and more than 1,000 tanks, over 2,600 armored vehicles and hundreds of aircraft. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers, and there are likely to be heavy losses on the Ukrainian side too. Still, it's undeniable that Russia military is weakened. Russia's guided-missile cruiser the Moskva -- once the crown jewel of its Black Sea fleet -- is now a wreck, sitting destroyed in the depths of the sea. Meanwhile, Putin's foes in the West, whom Russia had tried so hard to divide over years, are increasingly united, all for the cause of ensuring victory for Ukraine. Emily Ferris, a research fellow with the Royal United Services Institute, said that Russia's failures had been largely logistical. ""Some of the logistical problems they had were partly because they never really managed to take major railway hubs at all, frankly, in the whole country,"" Ferris told CNN. ""And because the Russian motorized ground forces rely on the railways to move all of their troops, their hardware and their tanks. Because they never really managed to control those hubs, they never really managed to push particularly far into Ukrainian territory, and it meant that they then had to rely on off-road capabilities."" Russian forces instead moved by trucks and slow-moving tanks, many of which were bogged down in mud, as warmer weather prevented the ground from freezing and allowing freer movement, Ferris said. ""Then it meant that it was tricky to tow the tanks back to Russia for repairs, because they were far away, and so a lot of them were abandoned. Lots of their equipment started breaking because the tanks can only take so much moving around,"" she said. ""And, of course, you have the very well-documented resistance from local Ukrainians, who didn't take too well to being occupied."" Even in the east, where Russian forces are trying to advance through the Donbas region, their gains have been limited. Pro-Russian rebels have been installed in the self-declared separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk for years, but still, Russia hasn't annexed those areas, and its forces are struggling to get through a stiff Ukrainian resistance in big cities. ""We're still talking about huge amounts of territory -- Ukraine is massive -- even if they are just focusing on the east and the south. Some of the claims from senior commanders that they're going to be establishing a land corridor across the south of Ukraine, it's still a huge task,"" Ferris said. ""The fact that they've not been able to take major cities and major rail hubs before is still a problem. I think that's going to persist."" An alternate universe Sitting in Russia, however, it's easy to think that the war is going to plan. Russian propaganda is flooding the media, which is almost entirely state-controlled, but in March the government also passed a law making ""false news"" about the military illegal, a crime that comes with a maximum 15-year jail term. As a result, the antiwar protests that happened in Russia in the early weeks of the invasion have all but ended. And the media is largely complying with the new law. Indeed, Russia is pushing ahead with force. It's in the midst of a prolonged battle in the southeastern port city of Mariupol, where its forces are intensely shelling a huge steel plant that it has failed to seize. If the plant falls, the city is more or less in their hands. Intelligence reports show that Russia could be planning to annex Luhansk and Donetsk ""sometime in mid-May"" and could also declare and annex a so-called ""people's republic"" in the southeastern city of Kherson, according to US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Michael Carpenter, who spoke to reporters on Monday. Any advancements are amplified in Russian media, where the messaging of success is very clear, Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political analysis firm R. Politik, told CNN. ""The message is that Russia is moving according to plan and everything is going as it should, that there are some gains. Russia has declared that it took Mariupol, and so everything is going according to the plan,"" she said. That messaging is filtering through to the Russian people effectively, according to Levada Center polls, which show that not only do the vast majority of Russians support the war, but 68% of Russians think the operation is proceeding successfully. Putin's popularity has also soared to 82%, after remaining stubbornly in the 60s since the Covid-19 pandemic hit right up until February, the month of Russia's invasion. Polling in Russia must be taken with a grain of salt, however, given people are subject to a stream of propaganda and dissent is not tolerated. Stanovaya added that there was an additional narrative in state media that Russia is the victim in this war and that the country is acting defensively. ""When you're watching Russian TV for several days, you can really start believing that we are in a huge danger of Ukrainian Nazis. That we are vulnerable, that we should, we must get up and protect ourselves, otherwise it's a matter of Russian existence,"" she said. Putin doesn't even need to use Monday to declare any kind of victory, Stanovaya argued. He will just need to bank on the anti-Nazi emotions of the holiday to consolidate his justification for war. The world waits As Russians will be listening in on Putin's Victory Day speech, so too will global leaders and observers, eager to learn where Putin might take his war next. There has been much speculation, but as always with the Russian President, no one really knows. There's a growing sense of nervousness that with so little to show the world -- if not Russians -- more than two months into the war, Putin may double down on his ""special operation."" UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace even suggested last week on a UK radio station that Putin may drop his guise of a ""special operation"" and outrightly declare war. Doing so could trigger a huge mobilization of Russian fighters, even civilian conscripts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday dismissed Wallace's suggestion as ""nonsense."" But if Russia's military continues to deplete at the rate it is, it's not impossible that Putin will make that decision at some point. Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he thinks Putin's original plan was to declare victory and an end to hostilities on Monday. ""But it is obvious that the war is dragging on, and Putin's plan is not getting any clearer. But he must make some symbolic or practical gesture,"" he said, speaking to CNN from Moscow. ""Everyone here is scared that he will announce a partial or full mobilization. Although such a measure might prove unpopular: the Russians have become militarists, but they are lazy militarists, sofa troops."" While Victory Day is about World War II, it has also become a source of legitimacy for Putin, who has found ways to associate himself with the day, said Kolesnikov, who accuses the leader of simplifying the historical details and ""turning the celebration into a pompous ritual."" In the Putin years, the mythology around World War II has metamorphosized. Historians note it glorifies Soviet sacrifice, while downplaying Stalin's willingness to squander human lives. It glosses over the darkest chapters of the war: The USSR's pact with Nazi Germany that served as a prelude to war; the wholesale deportation of entire populations deemed untrustworthy by the Soviets; and mass rapes by Soviet soldiers in occupied Germany during the waning days of the war. Even a grassroots parade known as the ""Immortal Regiment"" to honor those who died in the war has been co-opted by the government. Putin now routinely leads marches himself. Stalin -- who refused to believe Adolf Hitler's army would invade the Soviet Union when it did --- is increasingly being celebrated as a hero on May 9, not as the leader who was caught off guard in the 1941 German attack. ""Of course, the new generations do not really understand the significance of the holiday,"" Kolesnikov said. ""Those who do understand and know history are horrified by the way Putin has privatized it."" And on Monday, the significance of May 9 may change yet again, depending on what Putin has to say.",14,3.940066268570746,4.879831921826207,-0.9397656532554608,17
2022-05-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/europe/ukraine-drone-footage-popasna-intl/index.html,Drone footage shows how Russians destroyed one Ukrainian town in savage battle,"A 22-minute video shot by a surveillance drone over the Ukrainian town of Popasna has illustrated the stunning destruction being inflicted on settlements across the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. It's also another insight into the importance of drones in modern warfare, as well as the Russian approach to combat and the last-ditch resistance of Ukrainian units. The drone video shows that every property in the middle of the town is destroyed or damaged. Most appear to have been hit by Russian artillery or rocket fire. ""The Russians are not just destroying Popasna. They are removing it from the map of Luhansk region,"" according to the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration Serhiy Hayday. The drone video was originally posted by a pro-Russian Telegram channel and appears to have been taken by a Russian military drone. The drone appears to have been used to assist Russian infantry in hunting down the last Ukrainian defenders of the area. Ultimately, it hovers over the location where the Ukrainians are cornered and surrender. CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the video. It's unclear exactly when the video was taken, but intense fighting has taken place in Popasna in recent days, as the Russian advance has clashed with Ukrainian defenses in the town. The video begins with artillery strikes landing close to a trench just north of Popasna's center. At least one Ukrainian soldier is seen leaving the trench and taking refuge in what appears to be a nearby shed. At least four Russian soldiers move towards the shed. A number of explosions are seen, including two from grenades thrown by a Ukrainian soldier inside the shed. The drone video shows a Russian soldier throwing at least four grenades into or near the shed in which Ukrainian forces are sheltering. It's unclear whether any Ukrainian soldiers are killed or injured by the explosions. A later segment shows a number of Ukrainian soldiers lying on their stomachs outside. Again the drone is employed to survey the immediate vicinity, apparently to look for any movement or additional Ukrainian soldiers. Then, it shows at least six Ukrainian soldiers being escorted away, hands on their heads, and into Russian custody. Some pro-Russian social media accounts say the Russian soldiers are actually private military contractors with the Wagner Group -- a private military contractor with ties to the Kremlin that has sent operatives to Syria, Libya and several African countries -- which has been involved in the Donbas conflict since 2014. CNN cannot verify that, but Western intelligence agencies have said that Russian forces are employing private contractors or mercenaries in the conflict. The video also provides a glimpse into the Russian way of warfare, which holds that ground offensives should be preceded by massive ""indirect fire"" from artillery and rocket systems. Russian forces have a vast superiority over the Ukrainians in such systems, and Ukraine does not have enough air power to put a serious dent in them. In addition, Russian combat helicopters have been geolocated in the area in the last few days. As a recent study by the US defense think tank RAND noted, Russian battle groups are top-heavy with artillery. ""The main effort of a major Russian offensive operation likely would have maneuver units supported by an equal or greater number of artillery units. They will use large quantities of cluster munitions and artillery-delivered mines,"" the report predicted. Some analysts believe Russia has more than 50 battalion tactical groups, each of which would have about 1,000 soldiers, in the arc from Popasna to Izium further north. It's an enormous concentration of power. Despite weeks of shelling and rocket attacks, Ukrainian forces have refused to cede ground to the Russians in several towns in Luhansk and Donetsk. Only when they have nothing left to defend do they make a tactical retreat to prevent being captured. That's what happened in the town of Kremmina in April. ""In Kremmina, we understood that if we just held on to the land, the boys would die, and there would be no harm to the enemy, so we regrouped and left,"" Hayday said. But for at least a handful of Ukrainian soldiers in Popasna, escape was no longer an option.",14,4.092546390117102,2.6016551718357332,1.4908912182813685,21
2022-05-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/europe/ukraine-russia-railways-intl/index.html,"Russia intensifies attacks on railways, taking aim at Ukraine's lifeline to the outside world","The smell of burnt wire and rubber still lingered in the air around the railway power station on the outskirts of Lviv Wednesday morning, hours after the blaze was extinguished. A group of investigators was collecting debris from the Russian rockets that struck this place the evening before. Now it serves as evidence of Russia's attempts to systematically destroy key infrastructure. The Lviv power station was among six railway facilities in central and western Ukraine targeted by Russian forces on Tuesday evening, according to the chairman of Ukrainian Railways Olexander Kamyshin. The coordinated strikes briefly knocked out power in parts of the region and caused long delays to more than 40 trains. ""There were also disruptions on our pumping stations, which are supplying the city with water,"" Lviv Deputy Mayor Serhiy Kiral told CNN. He said contingency plans were executed to ensure the water supply was not impacted by the strikes. Tuesday's attack marks the latest in a series of recent attacks on the country's infrastructure, with the railway network now one of Russia's key targets. On Wednesday, Russia said it believed any weapons -- including NATO equipment -- arriving into and moving within Ukraine were targets, according to Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti. Five train stations in western and central Ukraine were hit in the space of an hour on April 25. Two days later, a missile struck a rail and road bridge across the Dniester Estuary that links the southern port city of Odesa with the country's far southwest region. Then on Friday, another important railway bridge was blown up near the town of Sloviansk in the eastern Donetsk region. Earlier in April, in one of the deadliest attacks so far, at least 50 people -- including five children -- were killed after Russian forces carried out a missile strike on a railway station in Kramatorsk. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday that Russian forces were ""attempting to hit what we assess to be critical infrastructure targets out towards the West"" in Ukraine including ""electrical power, transportation hubs, that kind of thing."" Kirby said that despite the most recent attacks, the US is still able to ""flow"" military assistance into the region, including ""weapons systems"" and other materials. The national railway has always played a crucial economic role in Ukraine, transporting agriculture and heavy industry exports across the country's vast territory. But since the Russian invasion began in late February, the train network has become Ukraine's lifeline to the outside world: It's how weapons, supplies and humanitarian aid get into the country. Mayor Kiral downplayed Russia's attempts, saying he believed it would not have ""any significant effect"" on supplies coming from the West. However, he did concede the attacks could hinder Ukraine's trade with the outside world. ""It may affect the exports of the Ukrainian commodities, which is very critical in these times of the year because we need to take out more than five million tons of grain in order to be ready for the new harvest."" The network has also been the backbone of global diplomacy and solidarity. When foreign officials -- including EU leaders, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken -- have visited the country, they too have traveled in and out by train. It is also a key lifeline to the many that have escaped the fighting. According to Ukrainian Railways, 3.8 million people -- nearly 10% of the country's entire population -- used trains to get to safety in the first two months of the war. For the more than 230,000 Ukrainians working for the railway network, the recent attacks have been a reminder of how dangerous -- and vital -- their jobs have become. ""We are worried. When we hear the siren, we have to run to the shelter. Just yesterday, two missiles hit nearby,"" Andriy, a railroad worker on one of the lines leading from Poland to Lviv, told CNN. Andriy declined to give his last name due to concerns for his safety. The railroad is a strategic asset and its employees are not officially authorized to speak to the media. Andriy, who has been working on the railway for 28 years, said he is incredibly proud to be part of the effort that keeps Ukraine moving. As he dug out stones and soil underneath the rail, he spoke of his fear. ""We just want to work in safety, nobody wants to be hit from the air,"" he said. As the railroad plays such an important role in the conflict, Ukrainians have also used it tactfully, striking against key parts of their own network in Russian-occupied areas of the country. Last Thursday, Ukrainian forces blew up a bridge that connects the Crimean Peninsula to a part of southern Ukraine occupied by the Russians in an attempt to disrupt their flow of weapons. Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa military administration, said Russian forces were using the bridge to ""supply weapons and fuel from Crimea."" Andriy's colleague Maksym is working on the railroad as part of his compulsory military service. As a religious man, Maksym, who also declined to give his last name, said his faith doesn't allow him to take up arms. ""So I am doing this as an alternative,"" he told CNN, saying that making sure that the trains keep running is his way of fighting.",17,3.5022076208105473,3.0996422211710932,0.40256539963945404,10
2022-05-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/eastern-ukraine-conflict-stakes-intl-cmd/index.html,"In Ukraine's Russian-speaking east, Putin's war is tearing families apart","The warm spring air is coming to eastern Ukraine. The roads are lined with red tulips, and people are reopening their summer kitchens, small buildings outside traditional homes used to isolate the heat and smells of cooking in the hotter months. It was in her elderly mother's wood-frame summer kitchen that Ludmilla, 69, was chatting to her brother Victor, 72, who went by Vitya, in the eastern city of Lysychansk last week. Despite near-constant bombardment from Russian troops just a few kilometers away, they had stayed in their family home since the invasion of Ukraine in late February. ""My brother and I were talking,"" said Ludmilla, who asked CNN to use only her first name out of privacy concerns. ""All at once, Grads started falling down one by one."" The windows were blown from their frames. ""Everything was cracking."" She recalled the initial shock and confusion. ""We're standing there -- my brother's making the sign of the cross, and I'm shouting. I turned away from him to look at the house, and then another explosion went off, and I was trapped under the rubble."" Ludmilla was momentarily blinded. Blood poured from her face and from lacerations on her hands and feet, but she was alive. She felt the touch of a neighbor, who pulled her to safety, to her basement. Her 96-year-old mother, mercifully, was unscathed. ""I ask, 'How's my brother, how's Vitya?' And the neighbor hides his eyes and says: 'Everything is fine.' ""I said to him, 'Vova, I don't believe it. If it were okay, he would have come seen us.' ""He says, 'Everything is OK down, sit down,' and goes out. And his wife is sitting next to me and says 'Luda, he doesn't know how to tell you. Vitya is dead.' ""That's it. And my brother would be 73-years-old on May 6. And that was it."" Death and loss are far from the only traumas in this Russian-speaking region. For many, the war has upended any remaining fellowship with Russia. According to a survey last year by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, 43% of Ukrainians report having relatives in Russia. Even in the Russian-speaking east, that camaraderie had already been waning since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatist movements. With this war, a history of pain is brought to the fore: of millions dead from famine and forced Soviet collectivization and of attempts, over decades, to wipe out Ukrainian culture and the Ukrainian language. It's hard to relate to someone if they believe Russian President Vladimir Putin's propaganda -- that the military is conducting a small and targeted operation that avoids civilian casualties. It's perhaps, even more difficult to relate if they don't believe your neighbors, brothers, and friends are being killed. Ludmilla's son, as well as her sister and her sister's family, all live in Russia. ""My granddaughter had a fight with my own sister's granddaughter,"" Ludmilla explained. ""She said, 'What are you making up? You are shooting at yourself, and you are lying,'"" adding that a ""lot of people"" in Russia don't believe what's really happening in her country. ""This is Putin's politics. Zombification,"" Ludmilla said. Whether Russia can conquer all of the Donbas -- the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk -- is an unanswered question after its military's underwhelming performance in the war's opening months. The devastation Russia will wreak in the attempt is certain, however. Ukrainian officials say the attackers will bombard urban centers with their considerable artillery reserves until there is nothing left for Ukrainians to defend. And it will leave untold Vityas and Ludmillas: dead, homeless, or bereaved. Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk region military administration, said that Russian forces are destroying every settlement on the front lines of the region. ""Strategically speaking, the only place they (Russians) can advance in is the areas they have completely destroyed,"" he told Ukrainian television on Monday. ""So they completely destroyed the whole of Novotoshkivka, there was no place to hold the defense -- and they occupied it."" The village of Novotoshkivka in Luhansk fell on April 25, according to Ukrainian accounts. Yet Hayday does not believe that his enemy will be able to outright capture Lysychansk's low-lying sister city, Severodonetsk, which lies across the Siverskyi Donets river. ""They need this victory for sure. But they will not attack Severodonetsk directly. They will try to encircle it,"" he told CNN, standing on a tree-lined street in comparatively placid Bakhmut. ""In two months, they have realized that they cannot break through the defense. So they are trying to bypass or cut off from the direction of Popasna and Rubizhne. And then the Luhansk region will be encircled. And then they won't need to lose the soldiers, they will just shoot all the areas."" This tactic is playing out not just on the eastern edge of what remains of the Ukrainian-controlled Luhansk region. It is also true in the south, along the line of contact that has existed since the 2014-15 breakaway rump states formed; and in the north, as Russia pushes south from Izium and west towards Lyman. If successful, it would trap a devastating portion of the Ukrainian military. The main population centers of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk -- so far largely unharmed from enemy artillery -- would find themselves behind enemy lines. Every day, backhoes carve more defensive trenches into the fertile fields, and trucks stack concrete and earthen chicanes onto the highways. A major railroad bridge between Sloviansk and Lyman was destroyed last week; whether by Russian strike or Ukrainian sabotage is still unclear. Hayday is convinced that the Ukrainian military can hold the Russians off for another two or three weeks. The small, agile anti-air and tank weapons given by Western powers are helping, he said. But it is only once the promised heavy artillery actually reaches the frontline that the tide can be turned. ""That, unfortunately, is not here yet,"" he said. ""And it could completely change the whole war."" Ludmilla now spends her days with her mother and a stranger in a small hospital room more than hour to the west, in Bakhmut. Her face is pockmarked with wounds from the debris that was blasted into her face. Most of her neighbors left for safer lands long ago. But many others have remained -- because they don't have the means to leave, because they want to protect their homes, or because they're in denial that this war will be any different than the long-simmering battles that have raged in this region since 2014. ""As long as greed and avarice in humanity are not overcome, these wars will never end,"" Ludmilla said. ""No matter how much a person has, it is always not enough.""",14,3.6150364081034145,2.8351328315783446,0.7799035765250699,17
2022-05-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/russia-ukraine-declaration-of-war-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"Putin may soon officially declare war on Ukraine, US and Western officials say","Russian President Vladimir Putin could formally declare war on Ukraine as soon as May 9, a move that would enable the full mobilization of Russia's reserve forces as invasion efforts continue to falter, US and Western officials believe. May 9, known as ""Victory Day"" inside of Russia, commemorates the country's defeat of the Nazis in 1945. Western officials have long believed that Putin would leverage the symbolic significance and propaganda value of that day to announce either a military achievement in Ukraine, a major escalation of hostilities -- or both. Officials have begun to hone in on one scenario, which is that Putin formally declares war on Ukraine on May 9. To date, Putin has insisted on referring to the brutal monthslong conflict as a ""special military operation,"" effectively banning words such as invasion and war. ""I think he will try to move from his 'special operation,'"" British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told LBC Radio last week. ""He's been rolling the pitch, laying the ground for being able to say 'look, this is now a war against Nazis, and what I need is more people. I need more Russian cannon fodder.'"" Throughout the conflict Putin has continuously framed his invasion of Ukraine -- a country with a Jewish president -- as a campaign of supposed ""denazification,"" a description dismissed by historians and political observers alike. Wallace added that he ""would not be surprised, and I don't have any information about this, that he is probably going to declare on this May Day that 'we are now at war with the world's Nazis and we need to mass mobilize the Russian people.'"" A formal declaration of war on May 9 could potentially bolster public support for the invasion. It would also, under Russian law, allow Putin to mobilize reserve forces and draft conscripts, which officials say Russia desperately needs amid a growing manpower shortage. Western and Ukrainian officials have estimated that at least 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war since Russia invaded just over two months ago. Russian battlefield effort 'anemic' Following a series of military and logistical setbacks, Moscow has concentrated efforts on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which has been on the frontline of the Russia-Ukraine conflict since 2014. But the US official on Monday described the Russian war effort there as ""anemic."" ""They'll move in and then declare victory, and then withdraw their troops, only to let the Ukrainians take it back,"" the official told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. The official said problems that have plagued the Russian military since their initial surge have not been fixed. ""They're still suffering from poor command-and-control, low morale in many units, less-than-ideal logistics,"" the official said. Russian forces were also keen to avoid risks that could lead to further casualties to their already depleted forces, the official said, describing the ground war in the area as ""very cautious, very tepid."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces were making significant progress in pushing the Russians back around Kharkiv, at the northwestern tip of the Donbas region, the official said. ""An incredible effort there that, again, hasn't gotten a lot of headlines and hasn't gotten a lot of attention, but it's just another piece of the stiff Ukrainian resistance that they continue to demonstrate,"" the official said. Putin's other May 9 options With less than a week to go before the May 9 Victory Day, Moscow may look at places other than Donbas to make a statement. Other options include annexing the breakaway territories of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, making a major push for Odesa in the south, or declaring full control over the southern port city of Mariupol. The US has ""highly credible"" intelligence reports that Russia will try to annex Luhansk and Donetsk ""some time in mid-May,"" the US Ambassador to OSCE Michael Carpenter said on Monday. There are also indications that Russia could be planning to declare and annex a ""people's republic"" in the southeastern city of Kherson. US State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday there is ""good reason to believe that the Russians will do everything they can to use"" May 9 for propaganda purposes. ""We've seen the Russians really double down on their propaganda efforts, probably, almost certainly, as a means to distract from their tactical and strategic failures on the battlefield in Ukraine,"" Price said at a State Department briefing. Price added that it ""would be a great irony if Moscow used the occasion of 'Victory Day' to declare war, which in itself would allow them to surge conscripts in a way they're not able to do now, in a way that would be tantamount to revealing to the world that their war effort is failing, that they are floundering in their military campaign and military objectives."" ""I'm quite confident that we'll be hearing more from Moscow in the lead up to May 9,"" Price added. ""I'm quite confident that you will be hearing more from the United States, from our partners, including our NATO partners, in the lead up to May 9 as well.""",14,2.5793319764804985,4.9568218037510965,-2.377489827270598,21
2022-05-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/finland-sweden-path-nato-membership-intl/index.html,What you need to know about Finland's and Sweden's path to NATO membership,"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Finland and Sweden have been considering applying for membership of the NATO military alliance, which would mark a major policy shift for the Nordic region. Here is the latest about the process and the key points under discussion. The coming days are crucial. On May 12, Finland will decide to apply for NATO membership, newspaper Iltalehti reported on Sunday, citing anonymous Finnish government sources. It would come in two steps, Iltalehti reported. President Sauli Niinisto would first announce his approval for Finland to join, followed by parliamentary groups giving their approval for the application. There would be no plenary vote in parliament but parliamentary group leaders expressing their groups' decisions. Reuters was not immediately available to confirm the report. In Sweden, parliament is conducting a security policy review, including the pros and cons of joining the alliance, with the results due on May 13. There is already a majority in parliament in support of NATO membership. In parallel, the ruling Social Democrats, the biggest party in every election for the last 100 years, will have an internal debate on May 9-12 on whether to drop long-standing opposition to NATO membership, with the party leadership to take a decision by May 24 at the latest. If Finland applies, Sweden is likely to do the same, as it would not want to be the sole Nordic outsider. Other Nordic countries - Norway, Denmark and Iceland -- have joined the pact as founding members. Several recent polls suggest a majority of Swedes are in favor -- something never seen before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Finland and Sweden would like to have some guarantees that NATO member nations would defend them during any transition period, when they would be applicants to the alliance, but not yet in. Ratification can take a year, NATO diplomats say, as parliaments of all 30 NATO countries need to approve new members. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said the countries could join ""quickly"" and that he was sure arrangements could be found for the interim period. The United States and Britain have promised Sweden ""increased military presence, more in-depth military exercises and 'strong political' support from NATO countries"" during a possible NATO application process, Swedish daily Aftonbladet reported. Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto acknowledged filing a membership application by itself would not bring the two Nordic countries under the umbrella of NATO's Article 5, which guarantees that an attack on one ally is an attack on all. ""But at the same time NATO member countries have an interest in that no security breaches would take place during the application period,"" Haavisto said, adding that Finland could, for instance, hold enhanced military exercises with NATO members during that time. Moscow has repeatedly warned of ""serious consequences"" if Finland and Sweden join NATO, saying it would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea, and raised the possibility of deploying nuclear weapons in the area. Russia and Finland share a 1,300-km (810-mile) border; the Kola Peninsula is a ""strategic bastion"" Moscow considers key for Russia's national security. It is also the home of the Russian Northern Fleet, and Russia's second-biggest city, St. Petersburg, lies some 170 km from the border with Finland.",29,7.330122428444871,7.43384308277909,-0.10372065433421884,13

But after a journey of more than 700 miles, the thieves were unable to use any of the equipment -- because it had been locked remotely. Over the past few weeks there's been a growing number of reports of Russian troops stealing farm equipment, grain and even building materials - beyond widespread looting of residences. But the removal of valuable agricultural equipment from a John Deere dealership in Melitopol speaks to an increasingly organized operation, one that even uses Russian military transport as part of the heist. CNN has learned that the equipment was removed from an Agrotek dealership in Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since early March. Altogether it's valued at nearly $5 million. The combine harvesters alone are worth $300,000 each. CNN is not naming a contact in Melitopol familiar with the details of the case for their own safety. The contact said the process began with the seizure of two combine harvesters, a tractor and a seeder. Over the next few weeks, everything else was removed: in all 27 pieces of farm machinery. One of the flat-bed trucks used, and caught on camera, had a white ""Z"" painted on it and appeared to be a military truck. The contact said there were rival groups of Russian troops: some would come in the morning and some in the evening. Some of the machinery was taken to a nearby village, but some of it embarked on a long overland journey to Chechnya more than 700 miles away. The sophistication of the machinery, which are equipped with GPS, meant that its travel could be tracked. It was last tracked to the village of Zakhan Yurt in Chechnya. The equipment ferried to Chechnya, which included combine harvesters -- can also be controlled remotely. ""When the invaders drove the stolen harvesters to Chechnya, they realized that they could not even turn them on, because the harvesters were locked remotely,"" the contact said. The equipment now appears to be languishing at a farm near Grozny. But the contact said that ""it seems that the hijackers have found consultants in Russia who are trying to bypass the protection."" ""Even if they sell harvesters for spare parts, they will earn some money,"" the contact said. Other sources in the Melitopol region say theft by Russian military units has extended to grain held in silos, in a region that produces hundreds of thousands of tonnes of crops a year. One source told CNN that ""the occupiers are offering local farmers to share their profits 50% to 50%."" But the farmers trying to work in areas occupied by Russian troops are unable to move their produce. ""Not a single elevator works. None of the ports are working. You will not take this grain from the occupied territory anywhere. "" So Russian forces are simply taking the grain, the source said. ""They steal it, take it to Crimea and that's it."" Last week the mayor of Melitopol posted a video showing a convoy of trucks leaving Melitopol allegedly loaded with grain. ""We have clear evidence that they unloaded grain from the Melitopol city elevator. They robbed the elevator along with private farms,"" the mayor told CNN.",14,5.790069295795935,3.5931586293928746,2.1969106664030607,0
2022-04-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/europe/mariupol-azovstal-steel-plant-intl-cmd/index.html,'They never expected Mariupol to resist.' Locals horrified by Russia's relentless attack on the vast steel plant shielding Ukrainians,"Lviv, Ukraine — Few beyond the metals industry had heard of Mariupol's Azovstal Steel and Iron Works before it became the scene of a desperate last stand against Russia's invading forces. Until recently Azovstal was a major player on the global stage, producing 4 million tons of steel annually and exporting the majority across the globe, according to its owner Metinvest Holding, Ukraine's biggest steelmaker. From London's Shard skyscraper to Hudson Yards in Manhattan to Genoa's San Giorgio Bridge (which replaced the collapsed Morandi Bridge), steel produced at Azovstal is used in some of the world's most recognizable landmarks. But for weeks now, the world has been gripped by the battle raging over the steelworks on the coast of the Sea of Azov. The pocket of Ukrainian fighters entrenched at the plant has become a symbol of the country's unwavering resistance in the face of an enemy that far outnumbers them. Yuriy Ryzhenkov, CEO of Metinvest Holding which owns the plant, is devastated by what he sees happening to the plant and to Mariupol. ""The city's literally under siege for almost two months now. And the Russians, they don't allow us to bring food into the city or water into the city,"" Ryzhenkov says. ""They're not allowing us to take the civilians out of the city in a centralized manner. They make the people either move out in their own automobiles or even walk by foot through the minefields. It's a humanitarian disaster there."" Asked why Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to take Azovstal so badly, Ryzhenkov tells CNN, ""I don't think it's the plant that he wants."" ""I think it's about the symbolism that they wanted to conquer Mariupol. They never expected Mariupol to resist."" At least 150 employees have been killed and thousands remain unaccounted for, he says. ""What we know is that out of the 11,000 employees at Azovstal,"" says Ryzhenkov, ""only about 4,500 people got out of Mariupol and got in contact with us so we know their whereabouts."" He seems haunted by the fate of Azovstal's workforce. ""For the last two months, the whole company tried to do anything possible to get the people to the safety. Unfortunately, at the moment, we're still not even half-way there."" The company's staff includes family dynasties who have made steel for as long as they can remember. Ivan Goltvenko, a 38-year-old human resources director at the plant, is the third generation of his family to work at Azovstal. ""I hoped I would work for Azovstal all my life and will contribute a lot to the fabric and to my city,"" he says sadly. ""Seeing your city being destroyed is horrible, You could compare it to a relative dying in your arms ... And seeing him or her dying gradually, organ after organ failing, and you can do nothing."" From the city of Zaphorizhzhia, he finds it hard to watch the scale of the devastation wrought by Russian airstrikes ""because you want your city to remain the same as it was in your memory."" News of what's happening back home is filtering through from friends and colleagues who are still trapped in Mariupol. ""Today, for example, I was shown a video of my apartment. Despite the fact that the house survived, my flat is completely looted by Russian soldiers. Nothing valuable was left -- they even rummaged among the children's toys, and many of them were stolen."" He says he spoke to one colleague on April 24 who revealed some of the horrors with which residents are being confronted. ""From one of the employees, who has a connection, we know that he is in the city, he didn't manage to leave, and he has been involved in debris removal and transporting the bodies of dead citizens,"" Goltvenko says. ""And yesterday he told me that for one day from only one district of the city, I would even say 'from only one street' he loaded four trucks of bodies. ""He said: 'I was drawn to volunteering at the morgue to collect bodies in the city and take them away.'"" ""For that,"" says Goltvenko, ""he receives a dry ration."" His colleague, 49-year-old Oleksiy Ehorov, deputy head for repairs, has lived in Mariupol since he was a child. ""I studied there, I started working there, there I've become the person who I am now. And seeing how it has been destroyed ... You can't tell it without tears, without a lump in the throat,"" he says. The agony is not over. Russian jets and missiles continue to pummel the site despite Putin saying last week there was no need to storm the industrial area around the plant. The defenders of Azovstal have repeatedly refused to give up their weapons. There are thought to be hundreds of soldiers and civilians still in the plant. Before the war What has happened at Azovstal is a mirror image of what's happened to a city proud of its history and industrial heritage. The industrial port city was perhaps never conventionally beautiful, with chimney stacks emitting smoke and steam into the sky over the plant. At the port, blue and yellow cranes moved heavy items around the bustling shipyard. But Mariupol had its charm and was beloved by its residents. In recent years, major improvements had been made, green spaces were developed and quality of life for the working-class communities was at last improving. ""The last eight years we've spent on building a modern and comfortable city there ... a good city to live in,"" Ryzhenkov says. ""We've completed some major environmental projects, and there were still plans to make sure that we have clean air, that we have clean water and so on and so forth. And now we're seeing all that is being destroyed in less than two months."" Maryna Holovnova, 28, says ""it was like a living dream"" because ""we had worked towards turning the city from just industrial small town to a cultural capital."" The Mariupol native returned in 2020 after a 10-year absence to find a burgeoning social scene. ""It was completely different,"" she tells CNN, proudly adding it had even been designated Ukraine's Cultural Capital last year by the Ministry of Culture. ""We had so many festivals and we had so many people coming from other cities and from other countries as well,"" she continues. ""We got a chance to tell the people about the city not only from the perspective of industrial development, but also from a cultural point of view [and] from the historical point of view -- because Mariupol has an amazing history."" A beaming smile spreads across her face as the former city guide remembers the route she'd take visitors on. It would start at Mariupol's century-old Old Water Tower, she says, before winding around the city center, taking in its many historic buildings and locations tied to home-grown personalities. Holovnova says with the waterfront metropolis continuing to thrive, a sailing tour was introduced last year, and plans were underway to launch an industrial-themed excursion complete with a factory tour showcasing the process of steel production. ""One of my favorite places, which was weird as locals wouldn't understand me ... was an observation point from where you could see the whole Azovstal factory and you could see how big it was, how huge it was, how great it was,"" she says. ""For locals it was nothing special because we get used to it but all the foreigners, people from other cities, they were amazed by the view."" City under siege The blossoming of Mariupol was an unlikely story, because it was swallowed by the violence of the 20th century. It was the scene of bitter fighting in World War II. This time, the devastation is even greater. Ukrainian officials say less than 20% of the city's buildings are unscathed. Russia's merciless bombing campaign has left rubble where landmarks like the Drama Theater once stood. Ukrainian officials say about 300 of the estimated 1,300 civilians who had sought sanctuary in the cultural institution are believed to have died when it was bombed in a brazen attack by Russia on March 16. The same applies to Azovstal. Built in 1933 under Soviet rule, it was partially demolished during the Nazi occupation in the 1940s before being rebuilt. Now it is gone again -- its carcass sheltering Ukrainian soldiers and around 1,000 civilians in a maze of underground chambers, according to Ukrainian officials. An estimated 100,000 people remain in the city. On Thursday, local authorities warned Mariupol was vulnerable to epidemics given the appalling sanitary conditions in much of the city and the fact that maybe thousands of bodies remain uncollected. Oleksiy Ehorov can't bear to think of what has happened to his city -- and his family. His mother-in-law died from injuries sustained from shelling during their first attempt to flee to Zaporizhzhia. ""My emotions disappeared already there in Mariupol. That's why there's nothing but hate,"" he tells CNN. Ehorov says he loved living by the sea and had hoped to stay at the steelworks until he retired. Now all he can do is watch as Russia continues to blockade the city and his former workplace. When asked if he'd work under the Russians if they take the factory, he echoes Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man and the main shareholder of the group behind Azovstal steel. ""No. I'm not going to. After what they did ... never.""",17,2.3313718302226376,3.9182666166028,-1.5868947863801623,1
2022-04-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/politics/russia-military-progress-eastern-ukraine/index.html,"Russia making 'slow and uneven' progress as military tries to fix problems that plagued early invasion, US officials say","Russian forces have made some progress in Moscow's renewed assault on eastern Ukraine, according to US and NATO officials, as their military tries to fix the myriad problems that plagued the early weeks of the invasion. The US has seen ""some evidence"" of improvement in Russia's ability to combine air and ground operations, as well as its capacity for resupplying forces in the field, officials say. The progress is ""slow and uneven,"" a senior US defense official said, allowing Russian forces to advance only ""several kilometers or so"" each day. But the US assesses that Russia is trying to learn from the mistakes it made early on, where columns of tanks and armor ran out of food and fuel, leaving them easy prey to Ukrainian hit-and-run tactics. Russia has placed command and control elements near its border with eastern Ukraine, according to a senior NATO official, a sign they are attempting to fix the communications and coordination failures observed in the attack on Kyiv. Before the invasion began on February 24, Russia amassed 125 to 130 battalion tactical groups, known as BTGs, around Ukraine and near Kyiv in particular, but when the fighting began, Russia's military leaders showed little ability to have them fight as one. There are 92 BTGS in country now, with another 20 just across border in Russia, according to the senior defense official. ""The attacks are somewhat better coordinated but with small formations. Company size units with helicopter support,"" a European defense official said. ""The lowest level of mutual support. In NATO this would be basic stuff."" Still, western officials familiar with the latest intelligence say even if Russia has learned key lessons from its systemic failures in the first stage of the conflict, it's not clear that Moscow will be able to implement the necessary changes to dominate in the Donbas region. Its military has suffered heavy losses in both manpower and equipment and officials believe that other equipment relocated from different parts of Ukraine likely isn't fully repaired yet. Many of the fighting units have cobbled together soldiers who have never fought or trained together. ""I don't know how many lessons they can actually operationalize. It's not a simple thing,"" said the senior NATO official. ""You don't just move tanks and personnel and say, 'Now go back into the fight!'"" US and Western officials largely agree with the assessment that a few weeks is not enough time for Russia to reconstitute its forces from the first phase of the campaign -- which took place across broad swaths of Ukrainian territory and led to the loss of thousands of Russian soldiers -- and believe Moscow will keep throwing additional forces into the conflict piecemeal. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been under pressure to demonstrate he can show a victory, and eastern Ukraine is the place where he is most likely to be able to quickly do that, US officials say. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin is focused on May 9, Russia's ""Victory Day,"" but even if he makes some sort of declaration then, officials say it will be unlikely to mark the end of his war on Ukraine. ""I think that date's likely to be a date where something is declared, but then they move on with the rest of the campaign,"" the senior NATO official said. A more conventional fight US and western officials caution that Russia's renewed assault, focused on breaking through Ukrainian defenses in the east using troops and materiel withdrawn from across the north of the country, is not yet fully underway. Russia continues to barrage Mariupol in the south, but in Donbas, its advances have been far more incremental. Officials anticipate the second phase of the campaign, focused on eastern Ukraine, will in some ways unfold quite differently from the initial assault that largely focused on capturing major urban areas. The dry and grassy plain isn't homogenous across the region, but in places may favor more conventional tank warfare. And unlike in the rest of the country, Ukraine has been fighting Russian-backed separatists there from dug-in trench positions since 2014. ""This renewed effort in Donbas, we'll see Russia mounting a campaign that I think is going to look a lot like conventional fights, really going back to World War I and World War II: much heavier equipment, different terrain, much more open,"" said the senior NATO official. Russia is ""sticking much more to a classic Russian military doctrine this time,"" said another NATO official -- in part because the proximity to the Russian border allows Russia to maintain shorter, more efficient supply lines. Russian forces have offered more coordinated air support to troops on the ground in Donbas and have been ""putting troops in less danger to keep casualties lower."" Western officials expect Russia to launch a three-pronged offensive to try to isolate and defeat the Ukrainian forces in a pincer. ""The concerns of the fight in the east are multifold,"" Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democratic from Illinois, told CNN. ""First of all, this is better terrain for the Russians. Second, shorter supply lines, lessons learned, and the fact that you've got a very angry Putin who is trying to rehabilitate, I think, the Russian military to the rest of the world."" One of Russia's key advantages remains the sheer size of the military force and the equipment the Kremlin has committed to this war. Last week, the US assessed about 75% of the forces it prepped for this invasion to be still intact, and the Kremlin has shown a willingness to commit as many forces as needed for their stated objective of controlling the Donbas region. It has a military ""mass"" that it is willing to throw at the objective until it is complete, one source told CNN, noting Putin has shown a complete indifference to how many Russian forces are killed in the process. No guaranteed outcome Still, despite the military advantages Russia still has, it's unclear whether it's enough to guarantee them the battlefield success that they failed to achieve around Kyiv and elsewhere. Russian units are in worse shape than expected, according to a US assessment, a defense official told CNN. ""Some tanks have a driver and no crew,"" the official said. ""Some (armored personnel carriers) have no one out the back."" Some of the units are down to 70% strength, the official noted, which is the line where western combat doctrine states that a unit can no longer be combat effective. The Russians have used poorly maintained and outdated equipment to refit their BTGs, mixing modernized and unmodernized equipment that could degrade their ability to effectively maneuver on the battlefield. At each step, Russia's attack on the Donbas region faces the same stiff Ukrainian resistance that stopped their advance toward Kyiv, with one notable difference. Ukrainian forces have fought Russian-backed separatists for years in this region, offering them ample time to dig into fortified defense positions. The Ukrainians are integrating new weapons and vehicles received from other countries, including the US, and continuing to exact a heavy toll, one source familiar with the situation told CNN. And as Russia has to extend its supply lines into Donbas, they will become more vulnerable, the source said. US officials also continue to take note of the composition of the Russian army, including Putin's move to extend enlistments and pull up the next wave of conscripts -- many of whom have been inactive for a long time. This suggests Putin is ""scraping bottom of the barrel,"" the source familiar with the situation said. ""Putin faces a conundrum. His force is declining in capability and his personnel status is one of his biggest problems. Reaching into the reserves aren't going to help ... in fact, I'd suggest that's going to hurt. It may provide 'bodies' but not trained soldiers who will make a difference,"" CNN military analyst and retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said. And the morale issues that have bedeviled Russian forces are still present. ""We have some early indications that while the conscripts start out with high morale because they've been feasting on Russian propaganda, it doesn't take very long before that morale is sapped once they get put into combat and face Ukrainian resistance,"" said the senior defense official Thursday on a background call with reporters. Finally, the weather may hamper Russian tanks. Mud may force them to stick to the roads, leaving them vulnerable to Ukrainian forces, as was the case on the outskirts of Kyiv. And taking urban areas in any war is challenging -- and favors the defender. ""I don't think the war is going to be over in the near term,"" said the senior NATO official.",14,6.334389479093706,1.961357636596037,4.373031842497669,12
2022-04-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/europe/russia-military-analysis-south-east-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Russia shifts tactics, steps up pace of assault in Ukraine's east and south","The war in eastern Ukraine appears to be entering a critical phase, as Russia pours in more fighting units and Ukrainian forces try to hold lines battered by weeks of shelling and rocket fire. On Wednesday, the Ukrainian military acknowledged losing territory in two different areas of the long front lines they are defending, a reflection perhaps of the sheer volume of Russian forces being deployed as well as improving Russian tactics. Essentially Ukrainian forces are defending three sides of a slowly shrinking pocket in the east, with their only supply lines running in from the west. The risk -- if the Russians make progress -- is that some of the Ukrainian army's best units, lacking protection from the air, could be cut off. The Ukrainian military said Wednesday that Russia has transferred two more battalion tactical groups of the 76th Airborne Assault Division from the Russian city of Belgorod to the Izium area inside Ukraine -- as well as cruise missile units. The Kremlin's declared aim is to secure all of Luhansk and Donetsk regions -- with the Russian military also eyeing a permanent land corridor connecting Russia's territory with Crimea along the Ukrainian coast. The Russian modus operandi seems similar regardless of location: days and sometimes weeks of heavy artillery, missile and air strikes that pulverize towns and cities, followed by the slow movement forward of armor. In Donetsk region, the Russian focus is on taking two important towns: Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, both of which were briefly held by Russian-backed separatists in 2014. Russian units are trying to push towards these centers from three directions. Advance units are probably within 10 miles of Sloviansk, and images emerged Wednesday of a road bridge southeast of the town that had been blown up -- possibly a defensive move by Ukrainian units fighting a tactical withdrawal. The Russian Ministry of Defense in its recent statements has suggested the offensive is accelerating, supported from the air. On Wednesday, it claimed 50 Ukrainian formations had been hit by its combat planes in the previous 24 hours. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in Washington says Russian tactics appear to have improved. ""Russian troops are pushing down multiple roughly parallel roads within supporting distance of one another, allowing them to bring more combat power to bear than their previous practice had supported,"" the ISW says in its latest analysis. South of Izium, Russian forces are advancing along three routes. It's as if Russian commanders have absorbed the lessons of Kyiv, when a single Russian column sat for weeks to the north of the capital. The ISW says that another factor in their advance may be that to the north of the Donbas region the Ukrainians don't have fixed defensive positions, as they have had in Donetsk and Luhansk along the ""line of contact"" since 2014. Those defenses mean the Russians are still struggling, despite weeks of missile and artillery attacks, to take places like Avdiivka, near Donetsk city. Similarly, the Ukrainians have held on in the city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk region, despite intense shelling witnessed by a CNN team there on Wednesday. But places like Severodonetsk and nearby Rubizhne are almost entirely ruined and at the end of long, tenuous supply lines for the Ukrainians. In turn, there are growing signs that the Ukrainians are taking aim at Russia's long supply lines. There have been more unexplained ""incidents"" far behind their front lines, as fuel and ammunition depots in western Russia have suddenly exploded in the middle of the night. A fuel dump near the Ukrainian border burned in the early hours of Wednesday, just as another near Belgorod did 24 hours earlier. Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility for these events, but on Wednesday presidential adviser Myhailo Podolyak said cryptically: ""In these Russian regions, large fuel depots that provide fuel for the Russian army's armored vehicles periodically burn and ammunition depots explode. For various reasons."" These rear positions represent obvious and necessary targets for the Ukrainians to try to complicate Russia's ability to sustain its ambitious offensive. The Ukrainians have also shown they can plan and execute successful counterattacks that harass Russian flanks, and they will be looking for further opportunities as the Russians try to push forward. Southern front The Russians have also stepped up the pace of military operations in the south. Over the past week, villages in the Zaporizhzhia region have seen heavy shelling, and the city of Kryvyi Rih now seems to be on the Russians' radar. That's at least the working assumption of Ukrainian officials. The Ukrainian military's Southern Command said Wednesday that Russian units were regrouping and conducting air reconnaissance as they tried to improve their tactical positions. A large area north of Mykolaiv has seen days of heavy fighting, with one Ukrainian soldier commenting on video about seeing a huge number of Russian armored personnel carriers. Within the past two days, a previously placid backwater of southwestern Ukraine has also been drawn into the conflict, after two missile attacks against the only bridge that connects it with Odesa and the rest of the country. This area is especially vulnerable given the presence of some 1,500 Russian troops in Transnistria, a breakaway region of neighboring Moldova. The destruction of the bridge followed two unexplained sabotage attacks in Transnistria. The Ukrainians see these incidents as planned provocations by the Russians -- a possible pretext for a move into the region to the west of the river Dniester, which borders Romania. Last week, a top Russian general said Russia intended to establish ""full control"" over southern Ukraine during the second phase of its invasion, adding that doing so would give its forces access to Transnistria. Overall, it seems that after abandoning plans to subdue Kyiv, Russian forces are trying to stretch their opponents along front lines that now run for hundreds of miles: from eastern Ukraine to the deep south. At the same time, they are hitting infrastructure far behind these front lines -- from railway power networks in western Ukraine to fuel and weapons stocks across the country. In the short term, it seems that the Russian command wants to deliver tangible results to the Kremlin in time for the Victory Day parades on May 9. In the longer term, questions remain over President Vladimir Putin's ultimate goals in Ukraine. The Ukrainians will need every last piece of promised Western weaponry to withstand what is now an onslaught, as well as agile tactics to ensure units are not surrounded.",14,1.9639443985285263,7.319739532877827,-5.355795134349301,21
2022-04-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/politics/kamala-harris-mark-vande-hei/index.html,Harris congratulates NASA astronaut who spent record 355 days in space,"Vice President Kamala Harris has congratulated NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei for his record-breaking 355-day stay in space, which ended when he returned to Earth late last month. ""I hope you know and feel that our nation, our planet, is so thankful to you for your years of dedicated service certainly to our country,"" Harris said to Vande Hei in a phone call held on April 6 that was shown in a video that the vice president's office published online Monday. ""Welcome home."" Vande Hei's highly anticipated return -- in part because of its length -- drew even more attention due to mounting geopolitical tensions since Russia's invasion into Ukraine as he was living with Russian cosmonauts on the International Space Station. Vande Hei returned to Earth with two Russian cosmonauts on a Soviet-era spacecraft. On Earth, the dynamic between the US and Russia changed quite drastically from when Vande Hei first launched in April 2021 to the space station. Tensions between the US and Russia turned frosty as the Russians were preparing for, and eventually launched, an invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. Ahead of Vande Hei's return, there were brief concerns that the Russians would abandon the astronaut in space, after Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin shared a heavily edited video showing two Russian cosmonauts floating inside the space station waving goodbye to Vande Hei. NASA has repeatedly reaffirmed that it continues to work closely with Russian space agency Roscosmos. Last week, Harris -- who chairs the National Space Council -- announced that the Biden administration would implement a self-imposed ban on anti-satellite weapons tests in an effort to encourage more responsible behavior in space. The move came five months after a successful test of a Russian ground-based missile, which hit a defunct Soviet-era satellite. The collision created a massive debris cloud of more than 1,500 trackable pieces, according to US Space Command, and threatened the safety of the astronauts on board the International Space Station. A White House official pointed to the contributions Vande Hei made to while in space and those he will continue to make back on Earth. The official said, ""Vande Hei will continue to provide NASA scientists and doctors more information to better understand whether long-term human spaceflight makes astronauts more susceptible to injuries on returning to Earth. Results will also help NASA design protective measures in future spacecraft."" The astronaut told Harris that he felt the whole experience was a privilege. ""It definitely felt like a privilege to get the opportunity to be up in space that long,"" Vande Hei said. ""So, thanks to the country for making that a possibility."" ""You were there in search of discovery, in search of science, in search of innovation,"" Harris said, asking about how his trip will help astronauts understand what it takes the human body to travel to other planets like the moon and Mars. ""We've been on the Moon but we've never stayed. We've been on board in orbit for more than 20 years, so we know how to stay in space. We do not yet know how to use the resources of another planetary object like the Moon,"" Vande Hei said. ""My hope is that the record that the team achieved with my flight is something that gets broken pretty quickly as we get better and better at understanding of how to keep a human being healthy and able to function when they get someplace else.""

2022-04-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/europe/mariupol-ukraine-russia-intl-hnk/index.html,"Mass graves near besieged Ukrainian city Mariupol are evidence of war crimes, say Ukrainian officials","Ukrainian officials say they have identified mass graves outside the city of Mariupol, which they say adds to mounting proof of Russian war crimes against Ukrainian civilians. The claim is supported by photos collected and analyzed by US satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies that appears to show more than 200 new graves at a site on the northwestern edge of Manhush, a town around 12 miles (19 kilometers) to the west of Mariupol. An estimated 100,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol which has been under constant bombardment since it was surrounded by Russian forces on March 1, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukrainian officials claim that more than 20,000 people in the city have died during the assault. In a post Thursday on messaging app Telegram, Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, said Russian trucks had collected bodies from the port city, before ""dumping them"" in Manhush. ""This is direct evidence of war crimes and attempts to cover them up."" A Maxar review of the satellite images from mid-March through to mid-April indicated the expansion of the grave site began between March 23 to 26, and continued into April. According to Maxar's analysis, there are more than 200 newly dug graves at a site on the northwestern edge of Manhush. ""According to recent media reports, Russian soldiers have been taking the bodies of people killed in Mariupol to this location,"" Maxar said in its analysis. CNN cannot independently verify claims Russians have disposed of bodies in mass graves at that location. A firm death toll following weeks of heavy bombardment of Mariupol is not available. However, journalists in Mariupol have documented the hasty burial of civilians in the besieged city, and images have surfaced on social media showing bodies apparently left for collection in the city. Vadym Boichenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said Thursday that women, children and elderly had died on the streets of the city. ""Unfortunately, we have seen that the bodies of dead Mariupol residents have begun to disappear from the streets of our city,"" he said. According to Boichenko, the mass graves are off a bypass road, near a cemetery. He said there was a field near the cemetery with 30 meter-long (98-feet-long) ditches. ""And there they bury them, bring the bodies of the dead by trucks and throw them into these ditches,"" he said. Putin proclaims Mariupol liberated Evidence of mass graves outside Mariupol surfaced as Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed the ""liberation"" of the southeastern port city by Russian forces -- even as he called off an attempt to storm the Azovstal steel plant, the final bastion of Ukrainian defenders inside the city, where civilians have also sheltered. Mariupol has been under near constant attack since the early day's of Putin's invasion, and much of the city has been destroyed by Russian shelling. Civilian structures targeted included a maternity hospital and a theater where up to 1,300 people were seeking refuge. Though many have fled, an estimated 100,000 people still remain in Mariupol and its immediate surroundings, which are reported to be largely under Russian control. Ukrainian officials, who maintain the city remains contested, have warned of a major humanitarian emergency in Mariupol as food and water run out, with electricity and gas cut -- but several attempts to establish evacuation corridors to allow civilians to escape have failed. ""Unfortunately, it is not possible today to evacuate civilians from Azovstal,"" Boichenko, the city's mayor, said Thursday. ""Because we are asking for a stable ceasefire. Somewhere we need one day to be able to accommodate those residents who have been hiding there for 57 days in a row, and they are being bombed, bombed and bombed."" US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said Wednesday that there ""was some hope that the Russians might allow"" safe passage for civilians and wounded soldiers from Mariupol. However, she warned that such an arrangement ""has fallen apart a number of times before"" and ultimately it is up to the Russians to allow safe passage. She also added that the siege of Mariupol speaks ""to the brutality of this war"" and the war crimes Vladimir Putin is committing. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general, said earlier this month that her office is investigating 5,800 cases of alleged Russian war crimes, with ""more and more"" proceedings opening every day. US President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has called the atrocities being uncovered in Ukraine a ""genocide."" Russia has denied allegations of war crimes and claims its forces do not target civilians.",17,5.225491228390911,2.96842958191076,2.2570616464801514,1
2022-04-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/europe/ukraine-sexual-violence-allegations-russia-cmd-intl/index.html,"Russian troops use rape as 'an instrument of war' in Ukraine, rights groups allege","When Russian troops invaded Ukraine and began closing in on its capital, Kyiv, Andrii Dereko begged his 22-year-old stepdaughter Karina Yershova to leave the suburb where she lived. But Yershova insisted she wanted to remain in Bucha, telling him: ""Don't talk nonsense, everything will be fine -- there will be no war,"" he said. With her tattoos and long brown hair, Yershova stood out in a crowd, her stepfather said, adding that despite living with rheumatoid arthritis, she had a fiercely independent spirit: ""She herself decided how to live."" Yershova worked at a sushi restaurant in Bucha, and hoped to earn her university degree in the future, Dereko said: ""She wanted to develop herself."" As Russian soldiers surrounded Bucha in early March, Yershova hid in an apartment with two other friends. On one of the last occasions Dereko and his wife, Olena, heard from Yershova, she told them she had left the apartment to get food from a nearby supermarket. ""We did not think that Russians would reach such a point that they would shoot civilians,"" he said. ""We all hoped that at least they would not touch women and children -- but the opposite happened."" When weeks went by without a word from Yershova, the family became desperate for news. Her mother left a message on Facebook begging anyone who knew what had happened to her to get in touch. She was told by friends that images of a dead woman with similar tattoos to Yershova's -- which included a rose on her forearm -- had been posted on a Telegram group set up by a detective in Bucha who was trying to identify hundreds of bodies found in the town after Russian troops withdrew from the area two weeks ago. Dereko says the images, seen by CNN, show his stepdaughter's mutilated body. Police told the family she had been killed by Russian soldiers. It looked like she was tortured or put up a fight, he said. ""They mutilated her. They shot her in the leg, and then gave her a tourniquet to stop her bleeding. And then they shot her in the temple."" Dereko also believes Yershova was sexually abused by Russian troops. ""The [police] investigator hinted"" that she had been raped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this claim. Officers who oversaw the case declined to comment to CNN due to the ongoing investigation. CNN has reached out to Kyiv prosecutors for comment. The Dereko family's agonizing wait for answers reflects the rising anxiety amid reports of wartime rape in the country. Ukrainian officials say Russian forces have been sexually abusing women, children and men since the invasion began, using rape and other sexual offenses as weapons of war. Human rights groups and Ukrainian psychologists who CNN spoke to say they have been working around the clock to deal with a growing number of sexual abuse cases allegedly involving Russian soldiers. A report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), released on April 13, found violations of international humanitarian law by Russian forces in Ukraine, noting that ""reports indicate instances of conflict-related gender-based violence, such as rape, sexual violence or sexual harassment."" ""Russian soldiers are doing everything they can to show their dominance, and rape is also a tool here,"" said psychologist Vasylisa Levchenko, who founded a service that provides free counselling for Ukrainians suffering from war-related trauma. Levchenko says her network, called Psy.For.Peace, has spoken to roughly 50 women from the Kyiv region who say they were sexually assaulted by Russian soldiers. She told CNN the group is dealing with cases including a 15-year-old and her mother who were sexually abused by pro-Russian Chechen soldiers, and the gang rape of another woman by seven soldiers -- while Ukrainian detainees were forced to watch. CNN has been unable to independently verify the account. ""The weapon [rape] is a demonstration of complete contempt for the [Ukrainian] people,"" Levchenko said, adding that it is one which has an impact far beyond the victims of individual attacks: ""There are people who feel guilty for not being able to do anything, guilty for surviving, for watching a person dying in front of them."" Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians since the war began -- a claim disproven by numerous attacks that have been verified by CNN and other news organizations. CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment. Breaking morale Alyona Krivulyak, who heads up a national hotline at La Strada-Ukraine -- a group that campaigns against gender-based violence -- told CNN that the hotline has received nine accounts of rape from around the country, the majority of them gang rapes of women. ""Rape is an instrument of war against the civilian population -- an instrument of destruction of the Ukrainian nation,"" she said. Psychologist Alexandra Kvitko, who works on a hotline for trauma victims run by Ukraine's ombudsman with the support of UNICEF, said she has heard dozens of accounts of conflict-related sexual violence. ""This amount of sexual violence, this kind of brutality has never happened before,"" she told CNN. In the five years she has been practicing, Kvitko said she had only dealt with 10 cases of sexual assault before the invasion. ""Now, in a few weeks of work I have 50 cases, and these are not only women -- these are children and boys and men,"" she said. Rape is being used to break the morale of Ukrainians, she said, ""to stop people from resisting."" Kvitko said that when one client ran out into the street to stop soldiers from raping her 19-year-old sister, ""a military man came up, grabbed her and said: 'No! Look! Tell everyone that this will happen to every Nazi whore.'"" Any such act of conflict-related sexual violence -- rape, forced prostitution, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy -- is considered a war crime and a breach of international human rights laws, said Charu Lata Hogg, the founder of human rights organization the All Survivors Project, which researches conflict-related sexual violence against men. ""Whether that is triggered within the context of a patriarchal and militarized masculinity, or whether it is exerted as a specific aim of warfare or whether it happens because people find a population at their mercy and therefore decide to inflict further harm,"" it is still a war crime, Lata Hogg told CNN. But even as Ukrainian and international prosecutors from the International Criminal Court (ICC) collect evidence of Russian war crimes, many sexual abuse victims are not yet ready to speak to officials about their ordeal, Levchenko said. ""All our psychologists must provide women with the contacts of the prosecutor's office so that when they are ready, women can seek legal assistance,"" psychologist Levchenko said, adding that none of her clients has so far reached out to Ukrainian prosecutors. Levchenko said many of the victims -- women, men and children -- need time to heal before speaking to the authorities. On Friday Andrii Niebytov, the head of Kyiv's police force, said his officers had only confirmed one suspected rape case so far in the region. ""We have [heard] such reports from outsiders, but when we talk to women, they refuse to confirm or deny such information,"" he said. Horrific precedent Reports of sexual violence often rise during times of conflict, and Ukraine has been no exception. Volodymyr Shcherbachenko, director of the Eastern Ukrainian Centre for Civic Initiatives (EUCCI), told CNN that the country had seen cases of sexual violence being used as a weapon in 2014, when Russian-backed separatists seized territory in the country's east after widespread protests called for closer integration to Europe. A joint report in 2017 by Justice for Peace in Donbas and other rights groups like EUCCI documented cases on both sides of the conflict, including rape and attempted rape, sexual harassment, and coercion to watch sexual violence against others. ""The most widespread form of sexual violence against women was rape,"" the report added. Lata Hogg, from the All Survivors Project, said that in the past month her group has had multiple accounts of sexual violence, ""and the pattern of sexual violence emerging in this context is not dissimilar to those which have been documented in other contexts globally,"" including during the conflict in Chechnya. Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, was leveled by Russian forces in a brutal war in the 1990s and early 2000s. Human Rights Watch reported at the time that Russian soldiers had raped Chechen women in Russian-held areas. Psychologist Levchenko worries that the true scale of Russian atrocities will only emerge when areas like Mariupol are liberated. In occupied cities and towns, Russian forces ""regularly visit women's homes, can check their phones, their photos, social networks,"" making it impossible for women to receive rape kits or other services, Krivulyak from La Strada-Ukraine said. ""This fear of armed people sometimes makes it impossible to ask for help, and this in turn makes it very difficult to document facts, which leads to problems around bringing [perpetrators] to justice,"" she said. Beyond the emotional trauma, ""there is also a very high risk of unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases,"" which is why medical attention is so important, she said. Shcherbachenko said EUCCI case workers are helping one local government worker in an occupied area of southern Ukraine who ""was specifically raped in order to force her to cooperate."" He said Russian soldiers had told her: ""We will rape you again if you don't do what you need to do ... For me, this shows [Russian forces are using] sexual violence as [a] weapon."" 'This time I couldn't save her' Rights groups say victims will shoulder the trauma of sexual abuse for the rest of their lives, while the families of those who died, like Karina Yershova, are left hunting for answers and dealing with the horror of happened to their loved ones. Yershova's body was found in a shallow grave in Bucha, alongside those of 65-year-old Natalia Mazokha and her husband, Victor, 64. CNN pieced together the final moments of their lives. Neighbors told the Mazokhas' daughter Julia that Russian soldiers had dragged a wounded woman -- believed to be Yershova -- into her parent's yard in the middle of March; Natalia tried to help her. The soldiers returned two minutes later, when ""mom was next to her [and] giving her help, and they [the Russians] shot her, shot my mother,"" Julia Mazokha said. Her father was killed in the hallway of their home when he tried to find out what was happening. ""They lay in the yard for 10 days, as I understand it,"" she said. The couple's neighbors called her around March 20 to inform her that her parents had been killed. Mazhokha said she had begged her parents to leave Bucha with her on March 12.

2022-04-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/europe/russia-ukraine-strategy-donbas-analysis-cmd-intl/index.html,"Pushed back from Kyiv, what's Russia's military strategy now?","Phase two of Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- an offensive in the eastern Donbas region -- is underway. The question is whether it will be any more successful and competent than phase one, and whether Ukraine will have enough troops and weapons to impede or even block it. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that the operation in the Donbas is ""a very important moment of this entire special operation."" The Russian goal is clear and publicly stated: to secure all of Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk -- parts of which Russian-backed separatists have controlled since 2014. A second aim is to crush the remaining resistance in the port city of Mariupol to consolidate a land bridge linking the Russian region of Rostov with Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine eight years ago. To those ends, Russian forces that were deployed to the north and east of Kyiv have been redeployed and in some cases reconstituted after suffering heavy losses. Now they -- and fresher units -- are piling into Ukraine from the northeast. US officials estimate that Russia has mobilized some 78 battalion tactical groups in eastern Ukraine -- probably about 75,000 troops. Still more are being assembled in Russian border regions. So far, their tactics have been straight out of the Russian playbook: massive use of artillery, rocket systems and missiles followed by armor advancing. Cities in Luhansk such as Severodonetsk, Popasna and Rubizhne have been reduced to rubble, with power, gas and water supplies destroyed. But Russian progress on the ground has been modest. That may be a result of not taking time to regroup after the battering they took in February and March. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says that ""Russian forces did not take the operational pause that was likely necessary to reconstitute and properly integrate damaged units withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine into operations in eastern Ukraine."" US officials have assessed that Russia has lost up to 25% of the combat firepower it had before the invasion. Boxing the Donbas in CNN analysis of satellite imagery, dozens of social media videos and the statements of both sides suggest the Russians are now trying to advance on three axes. Imagine the Donbas as a square: Russian forces are already on three sides -- leaving only the west open to the Ukrainians for reinforcements and, if necessary, retreat. From the south and the east, forward Russian units have advanced a few kilometers at best this month. In the south they had already made progress eating into Zaporizhzhia region, which neighbors Donetsk. This week, they began shelling villages well inside Zaporizhzhia. From the north, after taking the city of Izium at the beginning of this month, they have made little further progress. What's unclear at this stage is whether the Russians can and will change gear, and a better-coordinated offensive is around the corner. The report card from the Kyiv campaign suggests otherwise, but US officials believe that for now Russia is still conducting ""shaping operations ... to make sure they have logistics and sustainment in place."" Even so, the ISW assesses that ""The Russian military is unlikely to have addressed the root causes -- poor coordination, the inability to conduct cross-country operations, and low morale -- that impeded prior offensives."" Ukrainian tactics The Ukrainians have shown themselves to be canny tacticians in this conflict, ceding territory to preserve resources but using their knowledge of the land and their mobility to inflict losses on Russian units. This week Ukrainian units withdrew from the town of Kreminna in Luhansk region when confronted with overwhelming firepower. Now they have to decide if they will mount static defenses, which could lead to units being destroyed or surrounded in the face of Russia's artillery, rockets and armored assault. The alternative is mobile defense -- fighting and withdrawing from less vital terrain, hitting the Russians as they fall back and then holding their lines in terrain of their choosing. Simultaneously the Ukrainians will look to disrupt Russian supply lines -- sowing confusion while challenging Russian logistics and morale. And morale in some Russian units -- redeployed for their second offensive in as many months -- may be brittle. One of the Russian targets is the city of Sloviansk, but the surrounding territory includes forests, rivers and marshes -- difficult to transit and requiring specialist bridging equipment. Where the Russians are confined to roads, as became clear north of Kyiv, they are more vulnerable to both Ukrainian drones and light anti-tank missiles. Nor are the Ukrainians playing defense only; in recent days small units have made modest gains east and south of Kharkiv, potentially threatening Russian supply lines. If they can sustain this, the Russians would have to dedicate units to protecting these lines. There are already signs that Ukrainian special forces are operating behind Russian lines: last week a road bridge on a main route in from Russia was blown up. There was also unexplained damage to a railway bridge inside Russia, on the edge of Belgorod. The Russian military relies on railways for much of its logistics. In this aspect of the battle, Western intelligence support may play a critical role. Another important aspect of the fight to come is cultural. Ukrainian units enjoy some autonomy and are encouraged to exploit opportunities on the battlefield. Even in the absence of clear direction or orders, they have the motivation to fight. By contrast, the Russian command chain is rigid and the culture does not encourage enterprise. Even so the Ukrainians also face considerable risks. They are fighting -- essentially -- within a box that could close if the Russians were successful in one or more directions. They will have to maneuver smartly as they did around Kyiv, constantly alert for the risk of being surrounded. When Mariupol falls, the Russians can redirect the forces that were dedicated to that assault, but they have been degraded and exhausted by nearly two months of urban combat. Above all, in a race against time, Ukraine needs a constant resupply of weapons and ammunition, much of which must now come from outside the country through a lengthy supply line vulnerable to being interdicted. They need more anti-tank weapons and mobile air defenses. Counterattacks to disrupt the Russian offensive would need to be protected from the air. On Tuesday, a senior US official said Washington was working ""around the clock"" to get weapons to Ukraine at ""unprecedented"" speed. The United States has already authorized $2.3 billion in shipments of weapons and equipment to Ukraine since the invasion. ""What is unprecedented here is the amount of successive drawdowns that we are moving at this speed,"" the official said. Aiming for Victory Day There's been some talk of the Kremlin wanting tangible progress by May 9, when Russia celebrates Victory Day marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. At the current rate of progress, that looks unlikely. The much bigger question is whether this conflict stretches into the summer, in a grim war of attrition. The Russian military would have to rotate units, drawing on limited reserves, to sustain a conflict that has already battered its ground forces. Its calculation (and the Kremlin's political strategy) will be affected by the effectiveness of Ukrainian resistance and the ability of Western governments to supply Ukraine with more and better equipment. Writing in War on the Rocks, Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute in London said: ""Ukraine's defiance has bought time and an opportunity not only to stave off further Russian gains in the Donbas, but also to shape the battle beyond it. If Ukraine's allies act today, they may deter or at least prepare for a summer offensive."" There is an urgency about resupply. Last week, the Biden administration authorized another $800 million security package, which included artillery and anti-artillery radars. On Tuesday, the President indicated more is to come. Ukraine will require offensive hardware if it's to punish any vulnerability in Russian lines, and that includes heavy armor (such as battle-ready tanks) as well as a host of other systems. Watling says there's no time to lose. ""Providing Ukraine with tactical mobile air-defense systems such as the National would allow Ukraine to maneuver near the Russian border and retake towns while raiding Russian supply lines."" The National -- or NASAMS -- is an advanced and mobile surface-to-air missile system. Western governments understand that this is a critical moment: raising the cost of Russia's ""special military operation"" to the point where it is unaffordable. The Ukrainians are crying out for even more and better weaponry, especially as they try to keep their air force flying. Still outnumbered and outgunned, they will need agility, determination and reinforcements to stave off phase two of Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine.",14,3.775502562900856,4.142441495301942,-0.3669389324010863,21

Troops in the 64th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade were named by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense as war criminals earlier this month, after mass graves containing murdered civilians were discovered and dead bodies lay in the street following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region. In a signed letter on Monday, Putin congratulated the unit for their ""great heroism and courage"" and awarded the unit the title of ""Guards"" for ""protecting Russia's sovereignty."" ""Through astute and bold actions during the special military operation in Ukraine, the unit's staff became a role model in fulfilling its military duty, valor, dedication and professionalism,"" the president's congratulatory statement read. The move will be seen as a public message to Ukraine's government and the West, after numerous international leaders condemned the alleged atrocities by Russian troops in the Ukrainian towns of Bucha and Borodianka. Earlier this month, accounts of summary executions, brutality and indiscriminate shelling emerged in the wake of Russia's hasty retreat from central Ukraine. CNN teams saw dozens of bodies buried or strewn across the ground in the devastated suburb of Bucha, after a brutal occupation that lasted over a month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has blamed Russia for the killings and called on Moscow to stop committing ""war crimes."" The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the mass killings, while reiterating baseless claims that the images of civilian bodies on the streets of Bucha are fake. But during a visit to the towns of Bucha and Borodianka last week, International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan said there were ""reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC are being committed."" Khan also warned that it would be ""challenging"" to guarantee justice would be served in Ukraine, given Russia's decision to withdraw its signature from the ICC statute, which gives the court jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Russia does not extradite its citizens to other countries. Since Russia's failed attempt to capture Kyiv, it has refocused its invasion of Ukraine with an assault on the eastern Donbas region.",13,7.0265445519987315,4.178463096740598,2.848081455258134,19
2022-04-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/18/europe/ukraine-russia-mariupol-monday-intl/index.html,Mariupol's defenders dig in for last stand as Russia threatens to 'filter' out men,"The fate of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol is hanging on an unknown number of defenders making their last stand at an iron and steel plant. An ultimatum given by the Russian Defense Ministry to the last remaining Ukrainian troops still fighting in the port city has come and gone. The battle continues. Heavy fighting was still going on in Mariupol on Monday, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the city's mayor. He said Russian forces had begun issuing passes for movement within the city and that they announced entry and exit routes would be closed on Monday, warning that men remaining in the city would be ""filtered out."" That claim could not be independently verified, but Andriushchenko and other Ukrainian officials said Russian forces were bombarding the Azovstal plant, one of the city's last bastions still under Ukrainian control. The Russian military claims they have blockaded Ukrainian forces there. Myhailo Vershynin, chief of the Mariupol patrol police, told CNN the defenders inside are ""ready for fierce resistance."" ""They are aware what their fate may be, but no one is going to give up. Yesterday (the Russians) offered us a 'corridor,' they wanted us to leave without weapons, through the filtration points and then surrender,"" he told CNN in voice and text messages. ""Nobody agreed to this. No one will leave without a weapon,"" he added. 'Hell on earth' The Azovstal iron and steel works is a sprawling industrial complex in the southestern corner of Mariupol. The compound spans an area of more than four square miles and used to employ more than 10,000 people. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops are still holding out in the plant. Vershynin said that an estimated 1,000 civilians, including women, children and the elderly, were sheltering inside the plant. ""They have established their life there, provided themselves with food and water,"" he said. ""These people did not want and still do not want to go out. ... they were aware they had more chances to stay alive here."" The Commander of the Azov regiment, one of the units defending the city, said Russian forces were firing on the plant ""willingly"" as hundreds of people were sheltering inside. ""Russian occupational forces and their proxy from Luhansk People's Republic/Donetsk People's Republics know about civilians and keep their fire on the factory willingly. They use free-fall bombs, rockets, bunker-buster bombs, and all varieties of artillery, both ground and naval, for indiscriminate attacks,"" Lt. Col. Denys Prokopenko said on Telegram. The commander of the Ukrainian Marine unit in the city said Mariupol was ""what hell on earth looks like."" ""At the [Azovstal] plant, women with children and babies live in bunkers. In hunger and cold. Every day being targeted by the enemy aviation. The wounded die every day because there is no medicine, no water, no food,"" Maj. Serhii Volyna, commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, said in an open letter addressed to Pope Francis and published on the Ukrainska Pravda website on Monday. ""The time has come when praying is not enough,"" he added. The Pope has denounced the war and called for peace in his Easter Blessing on Sunday. Retired Lt. General and CNN military analyst Mark Hertling said Mariupol was a critical logistics hub. Its strategic position on the the coast of the Sea of Azov makes it a key target. Taking it would allow Russia to create a continuous land bridge from Donbas to Crimea, the peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014. ""It not only has roads, but it also has railroads and it has ports,"" Hertling said. ""It has roads going in every single direction, that road to the east goes to Rostov on Don inside of Russia, the roads to the north and northeast go to Luhansk and Donetsk, the roads to the northwest go to Zaporizhzhia and the roads to the south go down to the port city of Berdyansk. ""This next phase of the war is going to be a fight for logistics. So Mariupol is a critically important city in the eastern region it's the one they've all been fighting. Both sides have been fighting on what to control the roads, the other to prevent the control of the road when you go to the north."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the situation in Mariupol ""inhumane"" and said Russia was ""trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol."" Speaking to CNN last week, he said nobody knows how many civilians have died in Mariupol. ""Several thousand, tens of thousands, were forced to evacuate in the direction of the Russia Federation and we don't know where they are, they've left no document trail,"" Zelensky said. As fighting continued in Mariupol, it has also intensified in other parts of the country. Ukrainian officials in the Kharkiv and Luhansk regions reported heavy bombardments by Russian forces Monday, acknowledging a retreat from one important town but claiming to have successfully repulsed Russian attacks elsewhere. Meanwhile, the western city of Lviv, seen as a safe haven due to its proximity to the border, also came under attack on Monday. Maksym Kozytskyy, the Lviv regional military governor, said three missile strikes hit military warehouses that were not being used by the armed forces, and a fourth hit a tire-repair shop. Seven people have died, he said. Strategic city, nearly gone Mariupol has become the symbol of the terrifying brutality of Russia's unprovoked assault on Ukraine. But it is also a symbol of the fierce resistance of Ukrainians facing an enemy that is much more powerful. It was never a particularly picturesque city, its skyline dominated by steelworks, chemical plants and a port with a shipyard. But it has seen major improvements in recent years. Money flooded in and the quality of life improved. The parks were newly landscaped and little pockets turned into cool urban hangouts. With the improvements came a sense of pride among its residents. The city was thriving. Just weeks before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion, people in Mariupol were nervous, but didn't -- or perhaps didn't want to -- believe their hometown was in real danger. Now it's all gone. The vast majority of the southern city has been either destroyed or badly damaged. Photos and drone footage show there is hardly a street left untouched by the war. The relentless bombing has made it uninhabitable. Gone are many of its landmarks, like the famous Drama Theater that was flattened by Russian bombs last month. Its streets, where little coffee shops and trendy restaurants were beginning to pop up, are covered in debris and dust. An estimated 100,000 people remain in Mariupol and its immediate surroundings. They have no way out.",17,4.202464291523185,3.7381189508705286,0.46434534065265654,1

""What we have seen over the last few days is them continue to try to set the conditions,"" the senior defense official said in a call with reporters on Monday. ""We call it shaping operations."" ""It appears as if they are trying to learn from the failed lessons of the north where they didn't have proper sustainment capabilities in the area they were about to operate,"" the official said. The official said that the US has seen Russia moving in ""heavy artillery,"" ""command and control enablers"" and ""aviation, particularly rotary aviation support"" as part of the 11 new battalion tactical groups that have moved into the east and south of Ukraine ""over the last few days."" Russia is massing troops and appears close to taking the southeastern port city of Mariupol. CNN reported on Monday that the fate of Mariupol is hanging on an unknown number of defenders making their last stand at an iron and steel plant. Heavy fighting was still going on in the city on Monday, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the city's mayor. Later on Monday Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said the ""second phase of the war"" had begun in the eastern Donbas region, amid clear signs of a stepped-up Russian offensive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the battle for Donbas had begun in a video address on Monday. ""Russian forces have started the battle for Donbas for which they've been preparing for a long time and a considerable amount of the Russian forces are concentrated and focused on that offensive,"" Zelensky said. He underscored that Ukrainian forces will continue to fight against a Russian incursion in the region. ""No matter how many Russian servicemen they're bringing into that area, we will keep on fighting and defending and we will be doing this daily. We will not give up anything that is Ukrainian but we don't need anything that is not ours,"" Zelensky said. ""I'm thankful to all of our warriors, our soldiers, our heroic towns and towns in the region who are resisting and standing firm,"" he said. Russia's disjointed — and at times chaotic — operation in the north of Ukraine has been well-documented and their early military failures largely came as a surprise to US and western officials. Since Russia launched its assault on Ukraine on February 24, it has bombarded Ukrainian cities with missiles and artillery, destroying apartments, hospitals and schools and leaving scores of civilians dead. But its ground invasion has largely stalled and Moscow has failed to seize key cities, including Kyiv, amid fierce resistance from the Ukrainians and what senior defense officials have described as tactical errors. Russia focusing on east and south The US assesses that Russia has added 11 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) to their forces in the east and south since late last week, according to the senior US defense official, bringing Russia's total number of BTGs to 76. ""They have added to their capability inside Ukraine,"" the official said. The official said that all Russian ground forces are currently focused in the east and south of Ukraine, but the US is unable to pinpoint exactly how the new BTGs are spread out. In preparation for a new type of fight on the open plains of southeast Ukraine right next to Russia, the US is providing Kyiv with the types of high-power capabilities some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago. The new, $800 million weapons package represents the starkest sign to date that the war in Ukraine is shifting -- and with it, the weapons Ukraine will need if it hopes to continue to stymie a Russian military that has regrouped and resupplied after its initial failures in the opening weeks of the war. The Biden administration announced that the new package included 11 Mi-17 helicopters that had initially been earmarked for Afghanistan, 18 155 mm Howitzer cannons and 300 more Switchblade drones, in addition to radar systems capable of tracking incoming fire and pinpointing its origin. This package stands out from previous security assistance in part because this tranche includes more sophisticated and heavier-duty weaponry than previous shipments. A US official told CNN last week that's by design, arguing that because Russia, which was unable to capture Kyiv, has shifted its strategy to concentrate forces in eastern Ukraine, the US is shifting its own strategy in what it gives Ukraine. ""The contours of what they need is very different,"" the US official said. Several of the weapons systems are complex enough that the Pentagon has said it will need to provide training for Ukrainians outside the country, as was previously provided for the Switchblade drones, with the senior defense official saying that training on the Howitzers will begin ""in the next several days."" ""We'll try to get opportunities for a small number of Ukrainians to be familiarized with these systems,"" said Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby at a briefing with reporters last week, ""but we don't believe that it's going to be an onerous task or lengthy in time or in resources.""

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the city, which has been surrounded by Russian troops since March 1, has not fallen. Ukrainian troops trapped in the city are holding out against the Russian onslaught despite overwhelming odds. But they are confined to pockets of resistance, and their numbers are unclear. ""There are still our military forces, our soldiers, so they will fight until the end and as for now they are still in Mariupol,"" Shmyhal said on ABC News' ""This Week."" An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol also rejected the Russian ultimatum earlier on Sunday. Petro Andriushchenko said on Telegram ""as of today, our defenders continue to hold the defense."" The comments come after Russia's Ministry of Defense called on the Ukrainian soldiers still in Mariupol to surrender by 1 p.m. local time Sunday, warning anyone still resisting after the deadline ""will be eliminated."" The ministry later confirmed the ultimatum had been ignored. In a statement, the Russian ministry said the surrounded Ukrainian soldiers ""were offered to voluntarily lay down arms and surrender in order to save their lives."" ""However, the Kiev nationalist regime, according to the radio intercept, forbade negotiations about surrendering,"" the Ministry claimed. It also asserted, according to Ukrainian soldiers who had previously surrendered, ""there are up to 400 foreign mercenaries who joined the Ukrainian forces"" trapped at the plant, including Europeans and Canadians. ""In case of further resistance, all of them will be eliminated,"" it said. Shmyhal, Ukraine's prime minister, said despite the relentless Russian attacks, ""not one big city in Ukraine has fallen."" ""Only Kherson is under control of Russian military forces, but all of the rest of the cities are under Ukrainian control,"" he said, adding some of the cities in the surrounding areas were ""besieged but still under Ukrainian control."" He said more than 900 Ukrainian cities, towns and villages had been freed from Russian occupation since Moscow took control after the invasion began in late February. ""We still are fighting, and we have battle in Donbas region right now, but we do not have intention to surrender,"" Shmyhal said. How Mariupol is faring The situation in Mariupol is desperate. Much of the city has been destroyed by Russian shelling. Civilian structures targeted included a maternity hospital and a theater where up to 1,300 people were seeking refuge. The military governor of Ukraine's Donetsk region, where Mariupol is located, said Tuesday up to 22,000 people may have died in the city. CNN cannot verify the figures, as there are no independent casualty figures from the fighting in the city available. Though many have fled, an estimated 100,000 people still remain in Mariupol and its immediate surroundings, which are reported to be largely under Russian control. According to Russian state media, most of the Ukrainian defenders are located in the Azovstal steel works, one of the largest such plants in Europe with a network of rail tracks and furnaces. Andriushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said resistance to the Russians continued beyond the plant. ""Despite the occupiers' desire to show that the place of hostilities is limited to the Azovstal Steel Plant, this does not correspond with reality,"" Andriushchenko said. ""Last night there were fights on the Taganrog Street that is located five kilometers away from Azovstal."" He said ""during the fighting, the occupiers shelled private residential houses with heavy artillery again. The shelling of the port area also continued."" On Saturday during a late-night address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the situation in Mariupol ""inhuman"" and ""as severe as possible."" He and his administration had been trying every day to end the siege through both military and diplomatic channels, he said. ""Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol,"" he said in the video address. In a separate article posted on the presidential website, Zelensky said he was open to talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but negotiations would be impossible if further Russian war crimes surface. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Sunday the situation in Mariupol ""may be a red line"" in negotiations with Russia. ""The situation in Mariupol is both dire militarily and heartbreaking,"" Kuleba said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""The city doesn't exist anymore. The remaining of the Ukrainian army and a large group of civilians are basically encircled by the Russian forces. They continue their struggle, but it seems from the way the Russian army behaves in Mariupol, they decided to raze the city to the ground at any cost,"" he added. The foreign minister said he is anticipating the intensification of heavy fighting in eastern Ukraine in the ""coming weeks."" He also said he expects ""desperate attempts of the Russia forces to finish with Mariupol at any cost,"" adding he anticipates missile attacks on Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine to continue. Russia claims advances into Mariupol On Friday, the Russian military claimed it had made advances into Mariupol. ""The grouping of Russian troops and units of the Donetsk people's militia have completely liberated Illich Steelworks from Ukrainian nationalists as a result of the offensive in Mariupol city,"" said Russian military spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov in a statement. CNN cannot independently verify the claim. This came two days after the last remaining defenders in Mariupol carried out a ""risky maneuver"" to join forces and consolidate their defenses, according to Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych. Both units have been involved in a last-ditch attempt to resist the Russian offensive. However, one of the unit commanders in Mariupol acknowledged some Ukrainian defenders had surrendered. In a statement earlier this week, members of the Ukrainian Marines posted a video statement vowing to fight on ""until the end,"" despite being surrounded by Russian forces and running low on supplies. ""We did not give up our positions,"" the Marines said in the video. Ukrainian officials have warned of a major humanitarian emergency in Mariupol as food and water run out, with electricity and gas cut, urging the establishment of evacuation corridors to allow civilians to escape. But several attempts have failed, including an evacuation effort Saturday, with wet weather halting operations. Buses were unable to travel through a washed-out section of road between the town of Vasylivka and Zaporizhzhia to its north, according to a social media post by Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. Instead, people leaving Mariupol, Berdiansk, Tokmak and Enerhodar cities were told to get to Zaporizhzhia themselves. No evacuation routes are planned for Sunday because Ukrainian officials have been unable to agree on routes with the Russians. Vereshchuk said on her Telegram channel: ""We again demand providing the humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians, especially women and children from Mariupol."" She added: ""Through the relevant international organisations we also demand from the occupiers to open a special corridor for the evacuation of wounded soldiers from Mariupol."" Vereshchuk said Saturday 170 people did manage to escape from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia with their own means of transport of Saturday, but most of Mariupol's residents remain stuck in the city, facing constant bombardment.",17,2.549198143744815,4.375511713388574,-1.8263135696437596,1
2022-04-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/16/europe/russia-ukraine-war-retaliation-intl/index.html,'We all realize that we will not be forgiven.' Ukraine braces for new assault after sinking of Russian flagship,"The war in Ukraine could soon enter a new, even more dangerous phase. Russia, angry over the loss of its Black Sea Fleet flagship, has warned of ""unpredictable consequences"" if the US continues supplying weapons to Ukraine, while Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky struck a somber note telling CNN the world should be prepared for the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use tactical nuclear weapons. The sinking of the guided-missile cruiser Moskva on Thursday is the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years -- and a huge embarrassment for Russia. It comes at a time when US intelligence officials are warning about Putin's increasingly unpredictable behavior and willingness to take risks due to his anger over Russia's failures in Ukraine. While Moscow has denied the Ukrainian version of events -- that the Moskva sunk after being struck by Ukrainian missiles -- it was nevertheless forced to admit the ship went down. Russia has insisted the reason for the sinking was a fire, but the US on Friday confirmed Ukraine's account, with a senior defense official saying that the US believes that two Ukrainian Neptune missiles hit the Russian warship. As the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva was one of its most visible assets in the Ukraine war and its loss could impact the morale of Russian troops. Tellingly, the Russian government has not acknowledged casualties in the sinking of the ship, a marked contrast to the very public discussion about the Kursk submarine disaster, which claimed the lives of 118 sailors in 2000. Russia may have extinguished independent media, but the loss of the Moskva has likely made Putin even more furious about the situation in Ukraine. US officials believe Putin is angry over the failures of his troops in Ukraine. They believe Putin's advisers have not been telling him the full truth and did not prepare him for potential setbacks. The warship fiasco comes just weeks after top Russian military officials announced a shift in the focus of the invasion after their offensive appeared to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. Russia has also failed to achieve complete air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses of personnel since the start of the invasion. Russia was quick to strike back. Ukraine's Operational Command South said in a statement early Saturday that the situation in Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions was ""increasingly hostile."" ""Desperately trying to gain a foothold and hold on to the positions of the southern front, the world's most shameful army is pursuing civilians in Mykolayiv and Kherson regions. The work of snipers has been recorded in some areas."" The statement said Russian forces were ""enraged by the losses in the Black Sea"" and had ""intensified the missile threat"" in the region. Natalia Humeniuk, the spokeswoman for the armed forces in southern Ukraine, said that the missile attacks since Thursday night were in retaliation for the Moskva sinking. ""We all realize that we will not be forgiven,"" she said, accusing Russia of using ""cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions."" The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has previously said it had received credible allegations that Russian armed forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas in Ukraine. The nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) has also confirmed Russia's use of cluster munitions throughout the conflict. Zelensky has on Friday praised the Ukrainian armed forces for repelling Russian attacks, saying they were ""doing it brilliantly."" Zelensky has also praised the help Ukraine was getting from western countries, but has asked for more weapons to be shipped to the country. ""The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be and the sooner peace will come,"" he said. More weapons for Ukraine In another sign that the war in Ukraine is not going the way Russia has planned, Moscow has formally protested America's ongoing shipment of weapons to Ukraine. It sent a diplomatic note to the State Department warning of ""unpredictable consequences"" should the support continue, according to two US officials and another source familiar with the document. Some Biden administration officials believe that the diplomatic note shows the Russians are hurting, one official said. The official explained that they believe the Russians would not have sent that message if they felt they were in a strong place on the battlefield. The note, known as a demarche, was sent earlier this week as the US administration was preparing to announce that it would be sending a new military aid package worth $800 million to the Ukrainians. The EU has also approved an additional 500 million euros for military equipment for Ukraine. For the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US is providing Kyiv with high-power capabilities that some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago. These include Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzers and 300 more Switchblade drones. These types of weapons are designed for the type of fighting that's likely to take place in the Donbas region — open terrain rather than urban and wooded areas. The US is also shipping 40,000 artillery rounds, but that amount could be expended within several days if fighting in the east grows heavier. During previous battles, Ukrainian forces fired thousands of artillery rounds in a day, a US official said Saturday. There are growing concerns about the need to get more ammunition, in particular artillery ammunition, to Ukrainian forces more rapidly, a US official said. The Ukrainian military and regional officials have said Russian attacks have intensified in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east of the country as they prepare for a major ground offensive there. Going forward, US officials believe the likely Russia strategy is to move weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine from their current positions just north and then encircle and cut off Ukraine forces that are there, the official said. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley are conducting daily phone calls with counterparts in the region to encourage them to ship more weapons and supplies to Ukraine as soon as possible. Serhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk region military administration, has warned civilians who remain in Luhansk to leave the area. ""It is extremely dangerous to stay in the cities now. The shelling intensified,"" he said. The Ukrainian armed forces General Staff said that ""the main focus of the Russian enemy is on the regrouping and strengthening of troops"" around Slobozhansky, an area that is a short distance south of Kharkiv. In the same area, according to the General Staff, Russian forces have concentrated up to 22 battalion tactical groups around Izium. A battalion tactical group normally comprises about 1,000 troops.",14,4.811472677434068,3.7198357095111736,1.0916369679228946,12
2022-04-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/europe/donbas-region-ukraine-war-russia-explainer-intl/index.html,"Russia's war is ravaging Donbas, Ukraine's beleaguered heartland. Here's what the region means to Putin","Fighting in Ukraine has rounded on Donbas, a sprawling and beleaguered heartland region that has suffered years of conflict and now serves as the bloody stage on which Russia's war could be decided. Donbas blankets much of eastern Ukraine, and has been the front line of the country's conflict with Moscow since 2014. But now its people, already scarred by eight years of fighting, are enduring an assault even more intense. Russian forces are closing in on the city of Severodonetsk, and are making gradual progress in some parts of the region. Some assaults have been repelled by stubborn Ukrainian counteroffensives. Failures to take Kyiv and central Ukrainian regions in the invasion's early months meant Donbas became the centerpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin's military ambition. A Russian victory in the region would appall the West but could salvage Putin's war aims, while a defeat could cement his invasion as a historic failure. Either way, it is almost certain to devastate yet more of the Donbas region, a historically and culturally significant place whose proximity to Russia has dictated much of its turbulent existence. Those who have lived in and studied the region describe it as an independent and gritty center of industry that has remained suspicious of outside forces for decades. But the waves of conflict there since 2014 have reshaped and wounded its cities, and it is along its line of contact that both the Ukrainian and Russian military are most dug in -- making for a familiar but unpredictable new phase of war. 'Fiercely independent' Chimneys, factories and coal fields have dotted the landscape of Donbas for decades, and since its two major cities were founded -- Donetsk by a Welsh ironmaster in 1869, and Luhansk seven decades earlier by a Scottish industrialist -- industry has been the lifeblood of the region. The name Donbas is itself a portmanteau of the Donets Coal Basin, and throughout most of the 20th century it served an outsized role as the industrial heartland of the Soviet Union, pumping out coal in vast quantities. ""The Soviet Union intensively developed the Donbas as an industrial center,"" said Markian Dobczansky, an associate at Harvard University's Ukrainian Research Institute. ""It was a place that set the tempo of Soviet industrialization."" It was a place, too, of ""extremely high-stakes industrial production, and repression,"" Dobczansky adds. ""Terror was present under Soviet rule. Repression happened all over the Soviet Union, but it happened intensely in the Donbas."" Suspicion, arrests and show trials were rife. A rise in steel and metal manufacturing, the creation of a railroad and the development of a shipping industry in the port city of Mariupol diversified Donbas beyond its coal mining roots. But in the three decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, the region's economic might has shriveled. ""In the 1990s, the Donbas saw the floor drop out economically,"" Rory Finnin, associate professor of Ukrainian studies at the University of Cambridge, told CNN. A decline in living standards and rampant poverty plagued the region during its initial transition from communism, Finnin said, and Donbas is now often likened to the Rust Belt regions of the United States, where once-thriving heartland locations have struggled to adapt. But an upturn in fortunes followed the turn of the century; Donbas remains Ukraine's industrial epicenter, complimenting the agricultural production of the rest of the country. While prosperity in the region has wavered, one steadfast characteristic of its inhabitants has not. The people of Donbas have and remain ""fiercely independent,"" Finnin said. ""It marches to the beat of its own drum."" The region's long-standing industrial pull has attracted people from across Eastern Europe over the past century, and it has had strong social and economic ties to neighboring Russia as well as to the rest of Ukraine. Unlike much of central and western Ukraine, which had historically changed hands between various European empires, Donbas spent most of the past millennium under the control of Russia. In the country's only post-Soviet census in 2001, just over a half of the population of Donbas was made up of ethnic Ukrainians and a third of ethnic Russians. Russian is by some distance the most widely spoken language in Donbas, unlike in western Ukraine. But the country as a whole has a tradition of multilingualism and the connection between language and national identity is tenuous there, experts say. The cities of Donbas lie ""far away from the metropolitan centers, (and) far away from the big cities"" in central and western Ukraine, said Dobczansky. ""People could flee to the Donbas and get lost."" Western-influenced, pro-European politics has typically not been embraced in Donbas as it has in the west of Ukraine. That sense of disconnect from the capital Kyiv and other metropolitan centers has given rise to a vast collection of local movements, and was the backdrop upon which pro-Russian separatists attempted to seize control following Moscow's annexation of Crimea. But Finnin and others warn ""it's important not to fall to notions that the Donbas is pro-Russian or anti-Ukrainian,"" a concept that has been stirred up relentlessly by the Kremlin since 2014 but is roundly debunked by experts. In an exclusive CNN poll conducted by Savanta/ComRes shortly before Russia's invasion began, people in the easternmost region of Ukraine, which includes Donbas, mostly rejected the idea that Ukrainians and Russians are ""one people,"" and comprehensively disagreed that the two states should become one country. Fewer than one in five people there felt that way, compared to about a third of Russians who did, demonstrating the lack of desire to change national allegiance despite the region's longstanding cultural connections with Russia. ""(Pro-Russian) separatism prior to 2014 was a distinctly minority position,"" and no organized movement existed, Dobczansky said. Opinion polls -- and the region's own vote for independence in Ukraine's 1991 referendum -- affirmed Donbas' desire to leave Soviet-era allegiances behind. ""People would have a very strong sense of being a coal miner, or a metal worker, or being in the proletariat,"" he added. ""People (also) had a sense of being a part of the Ukrainian republic, but the idea was that the Donbas transcended national identities."" What Donbas means to Putin Despite its move into independence along with the rest of Ukraine in 1991, Donbas has maintained a place in the psyche of Russian leadership. A famous Soviet propaganda poster from 1921 dubbed Donbas ""the heart of Russia,"" depicting the region as a beating organ with vessels stretching across the Russian empire. Before then, the region was part of the concept of ""Novorossiya,"" or New Russia, a term given to territories towards the west of which the Russian empire had expansionist ideas. Cities like Luhansk and Donetsk are historically ""places that (Russians) could see a certain version of themselves,"" Finnin said. And that historical image could still persist inside Putin's own worldview, experts suggest. Observers have often suggested that Putin's desired endgame is to rebuild the Soviet Union in which he first rose up the ranks. Anna Makanju, former director for Russia at the US National Security Council, last month suggested that Putin ""believes he is like the czars,"" the imperial dynasties that ruled Russia for centuries, ""potentially called by God in order to control and restore the glory of the Russian empire."" But such a project could not be attempted without an effort to recapture Donbas, given its emotional resonance as the Russian empire's industrial backbone. ""It's symbolically very important; the Donbas supplied the entire Soviet Union with raw materials,"" Dobczansky said. It is in that context that Putin has refocused his stuttering invasion on the region where his conflict with Ukraine began eight years ago. ""There's every possibility that Putin will move now to effectively bisect Ukraine; that will give him enough to be able to declare a victory domestically, and allay his critics that this has been a botched invasion,"" said Samir Puri, a senior fellow in urban security and hybrid warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), who worked as a ceasefire observer in Donbas between 2014 and 2015. ""Taking the Donbas (would be) a consolation prize, because Kyiv is now out of Russia's military grasp, but it's a good consolation prize,"" Puri said. Eight years of conflict Putin's annexation of Crimea and the occupation of parts of Donbas by Russian-backed rebels in 2014 brought to a crashing halt a period of increasing prosperity in the region. War broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting left portions of Luhansk and Donetsk in the hands of Russian-backed separatists. The separatist-controlled areas in Donbas became known as the Luhansk and the Donetsk People's Republics. The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserts the two regions are, in effect, temporarily Russian-occupied. The self-declared republics have not recognized by any governments, other than Russia and its close ally Syria, and the Ukrainian government has steadfastly refused to talk directly with the leaders of either. But on the ground, living amid conflict became a way of life. ""Eastern Ukraine residents were living in a twilight zone -- they were in the front line of a geopolitical despite, and there was a sense of powerlessness,"" said Puri, who spent time on each side of the line of contact while observing the ceasefire. More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in Donbas since 2014, including 3,000 civilians caught up in the conflict. Ukraine says that since 2014, almost 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with over half of the registered internally displaced persons staying in the areas of Donbas that remained under Ukrainian control and about 160,000 resettling in the wider Kyiv region. Russia has meanwhile aggressively attempted to stir up separatist feeling in the region, which it has then pointed to as a justification for invading. Russian passports were offered to residents from 2019, and Kremlin messaging both in Russia and in separatist-held parts of Donbas has heavily played up notions of ethnic Russians being targeted. ""In propaganda since 2014, the Donbas has become a sacrificial lamb in Russian narratives,"" Dobczansky said. ""It's the place where the Russians have cultivated a cult of victimhood. They've managed to turn their own fomenting of a war into a narrative of victimhood at the hands of Ukrainian nationalists,"" he added. ""They hammer this point home."" That pretext ultimately led to Putin, two days before he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, declaring t",14,2.9819397165609725,3.382941717463727,-0.4010020009027544,21
2022-04-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/14/europe/ukraine-war-russia-trucks-logistics-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,What images of Russian trucks say about its military's struggles in Ukraine,"Think about modern warfare and it's likely images of soldiers, tanks and missiles will spring to mind. But arguably more important than any of these is something on which they all rely: the humble truck. Armies need trucks to transport their soldiers to the front lines, to supply those tanks with shells and to deliver those missiles. In short, any army that neglects its trucks does so at its peril. Yet that appears to be exactly the problem Russia's military is facing during its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, according to experts analyzing battlefield images as its forces withdraw from areas near Kyiv to focus on the Donbas. Photographs of damaged Russian trucks, they say, show tell-tale signs of Moscow's logistical struggles and suggest its efforts are being undermined by its reliance on conscripts, widespread corruption and use of civilian vehicles -- not to mention the huge distances involved in resupplying its forces, or Ukraine's own highly-motivated, tactically-adept resistance. ""Everything that an army needs to do its thing comes from a truck,"" says Trent Telenko, a former quality control auditor for the United States' Defense Contract Management Agency, who is among those parsing the images for clues as to how the war is going. ""The weapon isn't the tank, it's the shell the tank fires. That shell travels by a truck,"" Telenko points out. Food, fuel, medical supplies and even the soldiers themselves -- the presence of all of these rest on logistical supply lines heavily reliant on trucks, he says. And he has reason to believe there's a problem with those supply lines. Canary in the coal mine Telenko describes one recent photo of tire damage on a multimillion-dollar mobile missile truck, a Pantsir S1, as the canary in the coal mine for Russia's logistical efforts. As such an expensive piece of equipment, he would have expected its maintenance to be first-rate. Yet its tires were crumbling just a few weeks into the war -- what Telenko refers to as ""a failure mode."" If trucks are not moved frequently the rubber in their tires becomes brittle and the tire walls vulnerable to cracks and tears. Telenko says the problem is common when tires are run with low inflation to cope with the sort of muddy conditions that Russian forces are facing in the Ukrainian spring. For Telenko, who for more than a decade specialized in maintenance problems in the US military's truck fleet, the condition of the Pantsir S1 is a revealing mistake. ""If you're not doing (preventive maintenance) for something so important, then it's very clear the entire truck fleet was treated similarly,"" he says. Telenko's theory has echoes of US World War II Gen. Omar Bradley's famous quote that ""amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics."" And he is not the first to have detected a lack of professionalism in Russia's military, which includes hundreds of thousands of conscripts. In one notorious incident early in the war, a 40-mile (64-kilometer) convoy of Russian tanks, armored vehicles, and towed artillery became stalled 19 miles (30 km) outside Kyiv, bogged down according to Britain's Ministry of Defense not only by Ukrainian resistance but ""mechanical breakdowns"" too. Last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told CNN's Don Lemon that Russia had made ""missteps"" and ""struggled with logistics,"" while on Saturday a senior US defense official said the Russians had still not solved ""their logistics and sustainment problems"" and would be unable to reinforce their forces in eastern Ukraine ""with any great speed."" Another 'bad sign' Phillips O'Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, sees another ""bad sign"" for Russian truck logistics: its use of civilian trucks to replace military ones lost in battle. ""Civilian trucks are not made to military grade. They're not made to carry the loads, they're not made to carry the specific pieces of equipment,"" and in many cases cannot even operate off roads, O'Brien says. The rigors of war are already trying enough for the sturdiest military grade truck, let alone a civilian one. ""A single mile in peacetime, if you drive it in wartime is like 10 or 20 miles (16 to 32 km) because you are pushing the truck hard with huge payloads,"" O'Brien says. Switching between the two introduces a maintenance problem, as spare parts may not be compatible. And, as O'Brien points out, ""You don't want to have to get a new truck every time an old one breaks down."" Compounding the problem, according to Alex Vershinin, a former US Army officer who served four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, is that when vehicles do break down Russia has limited resources to recover them. The Russian army's battalion tactical groups -- those at the spearhead of its advances into Ukraine -- normally have only one light and one heavy recovery vehicle, even in units featuring dozens of vehicles, Vershinin wrote last month for the US Military Academy's Modern War Institute. This means combat vehicles sometimes need to be diverted to towing duties and sometimes broken down ""vehicles need to be towed up to a hundred miles,"" wrote Vershinin. O'Brien suggests Russia has neglected its trucks largely because they are not glitzy enough for a military keen to show off its cutting edge weapons systems. In recent years, Putin has boasted about Russia's hypersonic missiles like the Zircon and Kinzhal, stealth fighter jets like the Su-57, and its modern fleet of 11 ballistic missile submarines. ""Often glamorous dictator militaries are good at the showy weapons, they buy the fancy aircraft and the fancy tanks, but they don't actually buy the less glamorous stuff,"" O'Brien says. Conscription and corruption At the root of Russia's logistical problems, experts say, are two things that plague its military: conscription and corruption. About 25% of the Russian military's million troops are conscripts, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies -- though many experts believe that figure may be misleading, suspecting some of the non-conscript troops are either coerced or tricked into enlisting. Russia's conscripts tend to serve one-year stints, occupy the lower ranks, and fill many of the positions in the logistics chain, including vehicle maintenance. ""You can't really learn anything in a year about maintaining military systems,"" Telenko says. Conscripts also have little motivation as they know their time in the job is so limited, he says. A senior US defense official said Wednesday said Washington is seeing morale problems among Russia's conscripts, who make up ""almost half"" of its forces in Ukraine. ""We have evidence, even recent evidence, that they have been disillusioned by this war, weren't properly informed, weren't properly trained, weren't ready, not just physically but weren't ready mentally for what they were about to do,"" the US official said. By contrast, in the US military vehicle maintenance is handled by a volunteer non-commissioned officer corps, professional sergeants and corporals who stay for extended enlistments and are motivated by pay rises and promotions. ""You want to have as good people maintaining logistics as you do for every other branch,"" says O'Brien, at the University of St Andrews. He adds, in reference to Russia's apparent struggles, ""Were they in a shape for a logistics war or did they not just take it seriously?"" Then there is the corruption that experts say has dogged the Russian military for years. Matthew Stephenson, a Harvard Law School professor and editor in chief of the Global Anti-corruption Blog, wrote in March that corruption had a particularly corrosive effect on the Russian military's maintenance and supply logistics. ""All of these problems that anti-corruption experts and national security specialists had been emphasizing for years do seem to be manifesting in the current Russian invasion,"" he wrote. ""Corruption -- in the form of embezzlement or bribery -- can also lead to the purchase of substandard equipment, for example by giving the contract for equipment or maintenance to a less qualified supplier that is more willing to pay kickbacks. Or the person in charge of allocating the maintenance or procurement budget can simply report spending the full budgeted amount on high quality products or services, but then purchase low quality substitutes and pocket the difference. Telenko's view is that some of the effects are now being seen on the battlefield. He says money that should have been used for maintenance is ""likely lining the pockets of officers in charge of the conscripts who would be servicing the trucks."" A truck too far? There are other, subtler, signs of Russian struggles that might easily be missed by anyone who isn't logistically minded, experts say. For instance, says Alex Lord, Europe and Eurasia analyst at the Sibylline strategic analysis firm in London, Russia's military has historically relied on its large manpower reserves to handle logistics, rather than mechanized systems using wooden pallets and forklifts. Telenko gives the example of loading artillery shells onto a truck. A forklift can lift a pallet of two dozen shells in a single go, while manually lifting individual shells onto a truck would consume far more time and manpower. This makes Russian logistics around 30% less efficient than leading Western militaries, says Jason Crump, CEO of Sibylline and a veteran of 20 years in the British military. ""This means that it takes more trucks to do a given task in the same time, so greater fuel use and wear and tear,"" Crump says. It also means Russian trucks spend more time standing still while loading and unloading, according to Lord. ""This provides opportunities for Ukrainian forces to target them -- as we have seen Ukrainian commanders exploit numerous times during the current campaign,"" he says. All these problems only exacerbate the problems facing Moscow in what is already an uphill struggle for its forces given the distances involved. Trucks can usually operate up to 90 miles (145 kilometers) from their supply depot, Telenko points out. But Ukraine is about the size of Texas, almost 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) wide and 350 miles (563 kilometers) long. That means Russia would need to open numerous supply depots inside Ukraine for its troops to advance farther into Ukraine's interior. With Moscow already pulling back under fierce Ukrainian resistance that seems like a tall order. Russia is already thought to have lost a substantial number of trucks. Building more to replace them could take at least six months, Telenko estimates, by which time more losses would be likely. ""I don't see how the Russians can maintain their current positions, let alone make any offensive moves with their current truck fleet,"" he says. ""Trucks are the backbone of any modern mechanized military force, and if you don't have them you walk."" And if",14,4.105735411539019,3.7746356218007073,0.33109978973831167,12
2022-04-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/osce-moscow-mechanism-report-ukraine-russia/index.html,OSCE report finds 'clear patterns' of violations of international humanitarian law by Russian forces in Ukraine,"An expert report from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) found ""clear patterns"" of violations of international humanitarian law by Russian forces in Ukraine and detailed numerous incidents that it says could constitute war crimes. The report says it found ""credible evidence"" suggesting violations of ""even the most fundamental human rights (right to life, prohibition of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment) have been committed, mostly in the areas under the effective control of Russia or entities under overall control of Russia."" In a statement at the OSCE on Wednesday, US Ambassador Michael Carpenter said that ""taken as a whole, the report documents the catalog of inhumanity perpetrated by Russia's forces in Ukraine."" 'Documenting the sheer scope' ""The report is powerful in documenting the sheer scope of the Russian government's cruelty,"" Carpenter said. The 110-page report details reports of targeted killings, torture, rape and forced disappearances. The OSCE fact-finding mission ""received several reports, sometimes accompanied by photographic evidence, alleging the use by Russian troops of the red cross emblem to mark military non-medical vehicles, of Ukrainian flags, army or police uniforms or vehicles, white flags, civilian clothes, and OSCE symbols to facilitate their military operations,"" it says. It includes reports of a Ukrainian interpreter who was ""held in captivity for nine days"" by Russian forces. Left in an icy cellar, he was repeatedly beaten with an iron bar and rifle butts, tortured with electricity, deprived of food for 48 hours and subjected to a mock execution. It includes the report of a woman who was raped multiple times, ""in the presence of her small child,"" by a ""drunken Russian soldier"" who killed her husband. ""There are allegations of rapes, including gang rapes, committed by Russian soldiers in many other regions in Ukraine,"" the report states. It cites the Human Rights Ombudsperson of the Ukrainian Parliament, who said that ""500,000 civilians have been deported from Ukraine to Russia"" and ""that all of them had been forcibly displaced, first brought to some filtration camps in Russia near the Ukrainian border and that some of them were then brought as far as Sakhalin Island, but left there in freedom."" For many of the incidents, the report says they would constitute war crimes, but does not fully declare them as such. On the attack on the maternity hospital in Mariupol, however, it states: ""This attack therefore constitutes a clear violation of (international humanitarian law) and those responsible for it have committed a war crime."" ""While it may be that one hospital was used by the defender for military purposes or destroyed by mistake, it is hardly possible that this is the case when 50 hospitals are destroyed,"" the report states. It notes the ""particularly insidious form of attack"" known as ""double tap attacks"" that Russian forces allegedly carried out in Kharkiv in early March. A Russian cruise missile hit the Kharkiv regional administration -- and a second strike hit the building after rescuers arrived several minutes later. 'Not conceivable' The report was the result of a three-week-long fact-finding mission by the three OSCE experts, and covers the time period from the start of the war on February 24 to April 1. That mission was launched after 45 countries triggered the OSCE's Moscow Mechanism, which is used to look into allegations of human rights abuses. The report notes that the experts faced a number of limitations -- time and resource constraints, lack of access to Ukraine -- so ""a detailed assessment of most allegations of IHL violations and the identification of war crimes and crimes against humanity concerning particular incidents has not been possible."" However, ""it is not conceivable that so many civilians would have been killed and injured and so many civilian objects, including houses, hospitals, cultural property, schools, multi-story residential buildings, administrative buildings, penitentiary institutions, police stations, water stations and electricity systems would have been damaged or destroyed if Russia had respected its (international humanitarian law) obligations in terms of distinction, proportionality and precautions in conducting hostilities in Ukraine,"" it notes. The report did not cover the time period when developments like the atrocities in Bucha came to light, which it says ""require serious national and international enquiries, on the spot, with forensic experts."" It states that ""if confirmed, such killings would constitute egregious violations of (international humanitarian law) and war crimes."" The report says that ""violations occurred on the Ukrainian as well as on the Russian side."" ""The violations committed by the Russian Federation, however, are by far larger in nature and scale,"" it adds. Most of the reported violations by Ukraine are related to the treatment of Russian soldiers. The report also notes that Russia, which is a member of the OSCE, did not give additional information to the fact-finding mission, and instead ""referred the Mission to the official statements and briefings of the Government of the Russian Federation, which made it impossible for the Mission to take account of the Russian position on all pertinent incidents, except based on official open sources and websites."" ""The Permanent Representation of the Russian Federation informed the Mission upon request that it considered the Moscow Mechanism largely outdated and redundant,"" the report said. 'More detailed investigations are necessary' The OSCE report welcomed the work being done by other organizations -- the International Criminal Court (ICC), the United Nations, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) -- to investigate the crimes being committed in Ukraine. ""More detailed investigations are necessary, in particular with regard to establish individual criminal responsibility for war crimes,"" it states. Carpenter, the US Ambassador to the OSCE, told reporters that ""the information and evidence that was collected by the fact finding mission ... will be shared with other jurisdictions, such as the ICC and the ICJ. It can also be shared with national courts that may claim jurisdiction."" Carpenter did not rule out the possibility that the Moscow Mechanism could be triggered to look into further reports of atrocities being committed in Ukraine.

2022-04-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/hacking-industrial-facilities-energy-department/index.html,US officials warn of new hacking tools that could be used to target energy facilities,"US officials warned Wednesday that unnamed hackers have developed tools designed to ""gain full system access"" to the sensitive computer systems used to operate energy facilities. The tools could help a hacker burrow into an industrial computer network and ""disrupt critical devices or functions,"" said the Department of Energy, the FBI, the National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in an advisory. There are no reports of the malicious code being used in cyberattacks. But US officials and cybersecurity experts urged organizations to harden their defenses because the malicious software could be used to disrupt critical infrastructure if successfully deployed. The hacking tools could permit ""lower-skilled cyber actors to emulate higher-skilled actor capabilities,"" the US agencies said. The agencies did not identify who was responsible for developing the hacking tools or in what country they had been developed. CNN has requested comment from the agencies. Two US cybersecurity firms that analyzed the hacking tools, Dragos and Mandiant, said the malicious software was likely state-sponsored. Mandiant analysts called it ""an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability."" ""We are unable to associate (the hacking tools) with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity is consistent with Russia's historical interest"" in industrial control systems, Mandiant analysts said. The tools pose ""the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" the analysts added. For years, multiple state-linked hacking groups, including some tied to Russia, China and Iran, have taken an interest in infiltrating industrial computer networks. Doing so generally takes specialized knowledge and skill that is different from hacking a business computer network. For their part, US and Israeli hackers were reportedly behind the 2009 cyber operation against an Iranian facility for nuclear energy. Ukrainian authorities on Tuesday accused a hacking group linked with Russian military intelligence of trying to sabotage an electric utility that served about 2 million people in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said the attack had been thwarted and had not affected the provision of electricity at the utility. The Justice Department has blamed the same Russian hacking group for causing power outages in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. Those cyberattacks are the only two hacks on record that have successfully caused power outages, according to analysts.",3,4.04145378429716,8.047898269815953,-4.006444485518792,23
2022-04-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/genocide-russia-invasion-ukraine-what-matters/index.html,Here's what 'genocide' means and why it's so hard to prove,"President Joe Biden said this week that the atrocities being uncovered in Ukraine as Russia continues its invasion qualify as ""genocide."" The declaration is not expected to trigger any immediate changes to American policy toward the conflict, US officials familiar with the matter told CNN, though Biden's comment marks a dramatic rhetorical escalation. ""We'll let the lawyers decide, internationally, whether or not it qualifies,"" the President said, ""but it sure seems that way to me."" So what exactly does ""genocide"" mean, and how is it proved? Here's what you need to know: What does genocide mean? The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which was adopted after World War II, defines genocide as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" including: Killing members of the group. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. But world leaders can designate any event as a genocide using any criteria they choose, according to Leila Sadat, a war crimes expert at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law. How many times has the US designated a genocide? The US has made only eight formal determinations of genocide, according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. American hesitance at calling atrocities ""genocide"" is rooted in the term's strict legal definition, which was written following the Holocaust in 1948. The UN Genocide Convention obligates countries to intervene once a genocide is determined to be underway, stating, ""Genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish."" How is genocide designated? Biden administration officials have cited the genocide designation in Myanmar, made only last month, as an example of a process used to generate the label. It took the United States amassing evidence over the course of years to come to the determination that Myanmar's persecution of the Rohingya minority constituted a genocide. Another option for world governments is to seek out prosecution for genocide through the International Criminal Court, though the process is lengthy and proving genocide can be tricky. ""The difference between crimes against humanity -- which is a horrific crime -- and the subset of crimes against humanity that we call 'genocide' is we have to show that essentially the perpetrators in this case wish to destroy in whole or in part the Ukrainian people,"" Sadat told CNN. ""And it's a very high bar,"" she continued. ""Whether it should be a high bar is another question."" How long does it take to prosecute genocide? A long time. The International Criminal Court and national courts ""have to identify specific individuals who they have reasonable grounds to believe actually perpetrated those crimes in their individual capacity,"" Sadat said. ""And so the criminal investigations will take much longer because you have to identify the perpetrators; you have to collect the evidence against them. And then ultimately you would bring criminal trials to try to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that in fact they did perpetrate the crime -- either war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide,"" she added. What is the difference between genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes? Genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are related but distinct labels, per Sadat: War crimes are breaches of the laws and customs of war. Crimes against humanity are defined as widespread or systemic attacks directed at civilians. Genocide is when crimes against humanity are carried out with the goal of eliminating a population. Sadat describes the three labels as the ""atrocity cascade."" ""Once we have an active aggression like this with an invasion of a sovereign country, typically the cascade begins with war crimes. Then we see the crimes against humanity, and we have pockets of genocidal killing within the crimes against humanity,"" she said. Could Vladimir Putin be indicted for genocide? Hypothetically, yes. The International Criminal Court tries four types of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes. Anyone accused of a crime in the court's jurisdiction can be tried. The court tries people, not countries, and it focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for genocide. However, the International Criminal Court does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia. How are world leaders reacting to Biden's comment? In Ukraine, Biden's remark was welcomed by President Volodymyr Zelensky, who tweeted praise for the comment almost immediately. ""True words of a true leader,"" he wrote. ""Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil. We are grateful for US assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities."" But at least one key US ally, French President Emmanuel Macron, has pushed back on the comment. ""I want to continue to try, as much as I can, to stop this war and rebuild peace. I am not sure that an escalation of rhetoric serves that cause,"" Macron said. ""What we can say for sure is that the situation is unacceptable and that these are war crimes. We are living through war crimes that are unprecedented on our soil -- our European soil.""",13,6.264276118055985,1.18768172368353,5.076594394372455,19

Speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead,"" Iryna Venediktova said Ukraine has identified more than 500 suspects in the sprawling probe, including Russian politicians, military personnel and propaganda agents ""who wanted this war, who started this war and who continued this war."" ""We want to prosecute these war criminals in our Ukrainian courts, named by Ukraine,"" Venediktova said, while acknowledging the role of the International Criminal Court. Her comments come as shocking atrocities in Ukraine, allegedly at the hands of Russian forces, have amplified calls to pursue war crimes charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin. After images of at least 20 bodies strewn across the street in Bucha, Ukraine, emerged earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for an end to Russian ""war crimes."" Russia has denied any involvement in the incident, claiming -- without evidence -- that the atrocities in Bucha were staged, and part of a ""planned media campaign."" But witnesses who have spoken to CNN said the carnage in the town began weeks ago, when it was occupied by Russian forces, and a video depicts Russian forces appearing to indiscriminately fire at a civilian. Venediktova said Monday that she has made multiple visits to Bucha, where the community is ""still exhuming the dead bodies from the mass grave."" ""It is not only war crimes. Now we can say -- a lot of crimes against humanity,"" she said. The scenes out of the Kyiv suburb have drawn international outrage, with Western leaders -- including President Joe Biden -- calling for war crimes investigations and fresh sanctions against Russia. The President said earlier this month that the images from Bucha warranted calling Putin a ""war criminal,"" adding, ""but we have to gather the information. We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight and we have to get all the details so this can be an actual -- have a war crime trial."" The top war crimes prosecutor for the International Criminal Court has traveled to Ukraine to investigate, and the US Embassy in Kyiv argued in the war's opening days that specific Russian attacks constituted war crimes. Anyone accused of a crime in the jurisdiction of the court can be tried. The court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. Still, investigations at the International Criminal Court take many years, and only a handful of convictions have ever been won.",13,1.1775263247111032,7.102707358163127,-5.925181033452024,19
2022-04-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/europe/putin-finland-sweden-nato-backfire-cmd-intl/index.html,Putin's bullying backfires as Finland and Sweden edge closer to joining NATO,"When Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, his goals were clear. He wanted to bring his neighbor to heel, assert Russian authority in Eastern Europe and make the West think twice about expanding militarily and politically toward Russia's borders. But in one important respect, Putin's plan appears to have failed: The war has united the West against Moscow in ways that seemed unimaginable in January. Now, Finland and Sweden -- nations that are officially non-aligned -- are edging ever closer toward joining NATO, the US-led military alliance. Speaking at a joint news conference with her Swedish counterpart in Stockholm on Wednesday, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said her country's decision on whether to apply for membership would be made within ""weeks, not within months."" ""We need to have a view on the future and we are using this time to analyze and also build common views on the future when it comes to security,"" Marin said. ""I won't give any kind of timetable when we will make our decisions, but I think it will happen quite fast. Within weeks, not within months."" The Finnish government presented a wide-ranging report to the country's parliament on Wednesday, which considered the effects of NATO membership. The report says that if Finland and Sweden become full NATO members, ""the threshold for using military force in the Baltic Sea region would rise,"" enhancing ""the stability of the region in the long term."" The report says that the ""most significant effect"" of NATO membership ""would be that Finland would be part of NATO's collective defence, and be covered by the security guarantees enshrined in Article 5,"" adding that the deterrent effect of being a NATO member would be ""considerably stronger than it is at present, as it would be based on the capabilities of the entire Alliance. The report warns that due to Russia's ""negative view towards NATO enlargement,"" if Finland applied for NATO membership, it should be prepared for ""risks that are difficult to anticipate."" It adds that Finland ""would aim to continue to maintain functioning relations with Russia in the event it becomes a NATO member."" The paper also noted that ""close cooperation between Finland and Sweden during possible accession processes would be important,"" and that ""simultaneous accession processes"" for the two countries could also ""facilitate preparation for and response to Russia's possible reaction."" Sweden, meanwhile, is due to complete an analysis of its security policy by the end of May. A Swedish official previously told CNN that their nation could make its position public sooner, depending on when neighboring Finland does. On Wednesday, Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told the news conference that ""the security landscape has completely changed"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ""given this situation we have to really think through what is best for Sweden and our security and our peace in this new situation."" ""This is a very important time in history. There is a before and after 24th of February,"" Andersson said, referring to the date Russia's invasion began. ""We have to have a process in Sweden to think this through."" Andersson was also asked to comment on reports in Swedish media that Sweden has already decided to join the alliance. ""Sometimes if you read some statements in Swedish media, it's like you should be as quick as possible to make up your mind,"" she responded. ""I think you really have to analyze the new situation, do it very seriously, think about the consequences, the pros and cons of all potential ways forward."" Public opinion in both countries has shifted significantly since the invasion, and NATO allies and officials are on the whole supportive of the two countries joining. The only serious objection could come from Hungary, whose leader is close with Putin, but NATO officials think it would be able to twist Prime Minister Viktor Orban's arm. Given that Putin started his war demanding that NATO roll its borders back to where they were in the 1990s, the fact this is even being considered represents a diplomatic disaster for Moscow. And if Finland in particular were to join, Putin would find Russia suddenly sharing an additional 830-mile border with NATO. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned on Monday that expanding NATO wouldn't bring any more stability to Europe. ""We have repeatedly said that the alliance itself is more of a tool for confrontation. This is not an alliance that provides peace and stability, and further expansion of the alliance, of course, will not lead to more stability on the European continent,"" he said. Rob Bauer, the head of NATO's military committee, told reporters on Tuesday that the alliance has not ruled out new members, but said it was ultimately up to Finland and Sweden to decide whether they want to join, Reuters reported. ""It is a sovereign decision of any nation that wants to join NATO to apply for membership, which they so far have not done ... We are forcing no one into NATO,"" Bauer said. Nor has Putin's invasion motivated Ukraine to pull back from its desire for closer integration with the West. While the country is unlikely to join NATO, its efforts to join the European Union have accelerated since the start of the war. This would take a very long time and could also face stiff opposition from Hungary, which is already in a nasty battle with Brussels over its violations of the rule of law, causing the EU to propose suspending central funding to Budapest. However, once again, the fact it's being talked about and the level of support among EU leaders and officials is another indication of just how united the West has become against Russia. It's worth noting that since the start of the war, the West has remained largely united in its response to Russia, be it through economic sanctions or military support for Ukraine. However, there are a few challenges coming up that will test how united this alliance against Russia really is. First, if it emerges that Russia has used chemical weapons in Ukraine, there will be enormous pressure for the West, particularly NATO, to take an even more active role in the war -- something the alliance has been reluctant to do so far. NATO members have already discussed red lines and what action should be taken in the event of chemical weapons, but those details are still private to prevent Russia from taking pre-emptive protective action. However, any NATO intervention would almost certainly lead to a less stable security situation in Europe, as the West would risk a military confrontation with Russia -- a nuclear power, which would likely respond by intensifying its attacks on Ukraine and possibly in other areas of traditional Russian influence. Second, the cost of living crisis in many European countries could soon test the unity of future Western sanctions on Russia and embargoes on Russian energy. If, ultimately, the economy of Western Europe is deemed more important than holding Russia to account for waging war on its peaceful neighbor, then Putin could to some extent get away with invading an innocent country. But for now, as that unity largely holds, it is clear that Putin's desire to belittle the Western alliance has backfired -- and that the strongman has secured pariah status for his nation, possibly for years to come.",29,5.248621925819459,5.493201507690136,-0.24457958187067685,9
2022-04-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/11/europe/ukraine-donbas-battle-russia-cmd-intl/index.html,Russia has appointed a new general for Ukraine. Can Moscow reboot its war in time for Putin to claim a victory?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has a new general overseeing his war in Ukraine, and his military commanders are signaling a new phase in the war: an all-out effort to take and hold the portions of Ukraine's Donbas region still under Ukrainian control. Ukrainians seem to be taking that threat at face value. In the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, local officials have been urging many communities to evacuate, opening up humanitarian corridors for civilians to leave for safer parts of Ukraine. In northeastern Kharkiv region, authorities are evacuating the towns of Barvinkove and Lozova. In Dnipro, a regional capital in east-central Ukraine, the mayor, Borys Filatov, has requested that women, children and the elderly leave. ""The situation is gradually heating up in Donbas, and we understand that April will be quite hot,"" Filatov said recently. ""Therefore, a huge request: Everyone who has the opportunity (as I have said repeatedly) to leave -- first of all, this applies to women, children, and older people who are not involved in the work of critical infrastructure."" Can Russia mount a terrifying new offensive in the east? The latest satellite images collected and analyzed by Maxar Technologies show an 8-mile-long Russian military convoy making its south through the eastern Ukraine town of Velkyi Burluk, to the east of the city of Kharkiv. In remarks on national television Saturday, Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Interior Minister, said Kharkiv was ""being shelled practically all day long"" and that a Russian offensive was expected in the Kharkiv region, from the direction of Izium. Military experts and western officials have also speculated that Putin's generals are feeling the pressure to deliver some sort of results ahead of May 9, when Russia marks Victory Day, the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. But a fresh analysis from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based think tank, casts some doubt on Russia's ability to concentrate the forces needed to make a breakthrough in the Donbas. ""We assess that the Russian military will struggle to amass a large and combat-capable force of mechanized units to operate in Donbas within the next few months,"" the analysis states. ""Russia will likely continue to throw badly damaged and partially reconstituted units piecemeal into offensive operations that make limited gains at great cost."" Military analysts and observers say Russia may struggle to reorganize forces that have been battered by the Ukrainian military, particularly in the defense of Kyiv and northern Ukraine. Before the invasion, Russia had arrayed approximately 120 battalion tactical groups around Ukraine. According to one European official, about a quarter of those forces are ""effectively inoperable"" after heavy casualties and the destruction of hardware. A US defense official on April 8 gave a slightly different estimate, saying Russian forces were now ""below 85 percent of their assessed available combat power"" assembled ahead of the February 24 invasion. Those US defense estimates, ISW said, ""unintentionally exaggerate the Russian military's current capabilities to fight."" According to ISW, ""the dozens of Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) that retreated from around Kyiv likely possess combat power that is a fraction of what the numbers of units or total numbers of personnel with those units would suggest. Russian units that have fought in Ukraine have taken fearful damage."" A commander with a track record of brutality Army General Alexander Dvornikov, the commander of Russia's Southern Military District, has been named as theater commander of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, according to a US official and a European official. Dvornikov, 60, was the first commander of Russia's military operations in Syria, after Putin sent troops there in September 2015 to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. During Dvornikov's command in Syria from September 2015 to June 2016, Russian aircraft backed the Assad regime and its allies as they laid siege to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, bombarding densely populated neighborhoods and causing major civilian casualties. The city fell to Syrian government forces in December 2016. From 2000 to 2003 Dvornikov served in Russia's lengthy pacification campaign in the north Caucasus, including the Second Chechen War, which left the regional capital of Chechnya, Grozny, in ruins. Russian forces have used a similarly heavy-handed approach in parts of Ukraine, striking residential buildings in major cities and demolishing much of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Dvornikov was awarded the title of ""Hero the Russian Federation"" by the Kremlin in March 2016 for his services. The appointment of a new overall commander to lead Russia's war in Ukraine appears to be an effort to remedy another problem that has hampered Russian forces: lack of coordination. ""The Russians are apparently attempting to resolve one of the problems from which their initial invasion suffered by making Southern Military District Commander General Alexander Dvornikov the single overall commander of operations in Ukraine,"" ISW stated. ""This simplification of the Russian command structure may not resolve all of Russia's command problems, however... Russian forces will likely continue to struggle to establish coherent and efficient command and control arrangements for the foreseeable future."" That doesn't mean the coming weeks will be easy for Ukrainian forces fighting in the east. ISW said Russia's military ""likely will make gains nevertheless and may either trap or wear down Ukrainian forces enough to secure much of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, but it is at least equally likely that these Russian offensives will culminate before reaching their objectives, as similar Russian operations have done."" In remarks Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine was prepared for intense fighting. ""Ukraine is ready for big battles,"" said Podolyak. ""Ukraine must win them, particularly in Donbas. And after that, Ukraine will get a more powerful negotiating position, from which it can dictate certain conditions. After that, the presidents [of Ukraine and Russia] will meet. That may take two or three weeks."" The next weeks may prove if that is an overly optimistic scenario. But it presents what appears to be a negotiating position, as much as a military assessment: Putin can talk now, or risk being significantly weaker later.",14,5.0611394631092566,3.3056102100446667,1.7555292530645898,21

A total of 10 minibus drivers had driven into the Donbas region to help evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol, operating private vehicles in a low-profile rescue mission. Russian soldiers stopped them and tried to get them to drive the buses into Russia. When the drivers refused, they were taken prisoner, said Alex Voronin, the head of the non-government organization. Voronin told CNN he had lost contact with all the drivers but one. ""All of them carried out the evacuation of people in the direction of Mariupol-Zaporizhzhia, they were sent on their trips on different dates - March 26, 27 and 31,"" Voronin told CNN. ""Communication with them broke off the next day after departure. According to the people they managed to evacuate, the Russian military took the vehicles with people in Mariupol from the drivers, the evacuees were taken to the village of Nikolske, the drivers themselves were taken away for identification. Some of them are being held in pre-trial detention centers in Donetsk."" One of the 10 drivers was released, Voronin told CNN, and from him ""we know that three of the missing are in Donetsk. They were interrogated with brute force, fed poorly and kept in appalling conditions. All the rest were told they have the right to keep [in detention] up to 30 days."" CNN cannot independently verify the whereabouts of the drivers or the conditions under which they are being held. Voronin said drivers left the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia and did not drive in a single convoy. The city of Mariupol has been devastated by weeks of shelling and is ringed by Russian checkpoints. On Monday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed South Korean lawmakers, saying he believes there are tens of thousands dead in the southern port city. ""The occupiers blocked it and did not even allow food and water to be brought there. They tried to capture it in the most brutal way - just to destroy everything in the city,"" he said. Ukrainian officials have said around 100,000 people still require evacuation from the city but say Russian forces have not allowed convoys of evacuation buses to reach the city. Adding to the humanitarian crisis, US and Ukrainian officials and humanitarian watchdogs say Russian and separatist troops are forcing tens of thousands of civilians into so-called ""filtration centers"" in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic before moving them into Russian territory. Voronin's group was formed at the beginning of the war, on February 24, in Ukraine, to help evacuate Ukrainians. He says his group -- one of many that sprang up in the days since the Russian invasion -- has ""evacuated more than 2,000 people, children, the disabled and the wounded, and delivered more than 200 tons of food, humanitarian aid and medicine to the same locations where we are evacuating people."" Voronin says he does not even know who on the Russian side he can talk to in order to secure the release of his drivers. CNN has not been able to verify the whereabouts of the drivers amid the fog of war and confusion in the frontlines and is reporting this at the request of the aid group in the hopes that bringing attention to the story will bring protection of some sort to the missing drivers.

Now, a painstaking demining operation is underway","On the outskirts of Kyiv, Lt. Col. Mykola Opanasenko kneels down in a remote field as he winds up a small electrical generator to power a blast. ""Fire,"" he shouts, before bracing and pressing the trigger. A fraction of a second later, an ear-ringing bang pierces through the otherwise silent countryside. This is the sixth controlled explosion 34-year-old Opanasenko and his demining unit have carried out since Russia withdrew its forces from the Kyiv region earlier this month. Today, they blew up 16 unexploded artillery shells, each weighing around 45 kilograms (nearly 100 pounds), in one explosion. They have another 30 shells to go through before the day is over. Their unit is one of many operating in the region. In total, they say they've destroyed 2.5 tons of ammunition in the past week and a half alone. ""If we are all alive, then everything is successful,"" Opanasenko says. As Russian forces retreated, they left behind scores of unexploded shells and bombs in addition to mines they planted to slow down the Ukrainian advance, to protect their withdrawal, or perhaps, simply to scorch the earth. Mines, ammunition and rusty machine guns from destroyed armored vehicles can be dangerous for civilians now returning to their homes, so Opanasenko's unit goes from village to village, scouring the ground for any of these deadly ordnances that need to be cleared out. Signs warning of mines can be seen across towns and villages around Kyiv. Units like Opanasenko's will continue their work for months to come across the country as the war rages on, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service (SES). ""As of now, we need to survey more than 300,000 hectares,"" the head of the SES, Serhiy Kruk, told journalists last Wednesday. ""Therefore, in cooperation with the Armed Forces and the National Police of Ukraine, we are actively working and doing everything to return people and restore livelihoods,"" he said, adding Kyiv will be a model for similar efforts in other regions. At a different location near the capital, Opanasenko shows CNN another dangerous ordnance they've found in a backyard. It's tube shaped, with a blunt red tip and six fin-like attachments at its end. ""It is one of the elements of a cluster bomb dropped from an airplane,"" he says. ""There are about 50 such elements in one bomb."" ""This is a highly explosive fragmentation bomb to kill people, designed just to kill people,"" Opanasenko adds, before taking it away for disposal. His unit has found several of these explosives around the Ukrainian capital, he says. Russian forces have been accused of regularly using cluster munitions against civilian targets in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said it received credible allegations that Russian armed forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times. Such attacks ""may amount to war crimes,"" UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also said he viewed these actions as ""war crimes,"" intended to ""kill or maim as many of our people as possible."" Speaking during his almost nightly address on Monday -- the 47th day since the start of the invasion -- Zelensky said that Russian troops retreating from parts of northern Ukraine had deliberately left thousands of mines in their wake, adding they would not have done so without explicit orders from Russia's leadership. He said in areas in northern Ukraine from which Russian troops had withdrawn, ""tens if not hundreds of thousands"" of unexploded ordnance had been left behind. He added that teams were working to clear these ""dangerous items,"" which ""invaders left mines everywhere,"" including in homes, on streets and in fields. ""They deliberately did everything to ensure that the return to these areas after de-occupation was as dangerous as possible. Due to the actions of the Russian army, our territory today is one of the most contaminated by mines in the world,"" Zelensky added. A larger effort Mine sweeping goes hand in hand with other clean-up efforts as residents from the Kyiv region begin to embrace their new reality and try and return to what is left of their shattered lives following Russia's withdrawal. Around 30,000 people have returned to the area, according to local authorities. Some businesses are reopening, and traffic is significantly increasing. Some military checkpoints have also been removed from the city's arteries and some public transportation is resuming. As they do, authorities are continuing to remove debris from the streets, including shells of destroyed tanks and other armored vehicles. It's a seemingly endless clean-up task for public officials, especially those who are tasked with collecting bodies caught in the cross fire. At the main cemetery in Irpin, a Kyiv suburb, rows of graves for soldiers and civilians have been freshly dug. Here, the military burials take place in quick succession. Russia may be regrouping, shifting its forces towards the East, but the war is not over -- and there's not a moment to spare. Tetyana Bliznyuk is surrounded by her husband's comrades as his body is laid to rest just before the sun sets, the last of the day's burials for members of Ukraine's Armed Forces. When she last saw her husband, Oleksandr Lytkin, he promised her he'd be right back, Bliznyuk says. ""(He was killed by) a mortar shell,"" she says, her eyes still swollen red. ""I'm very proud of him, he's a hero."" ""It's so scary! No one thought this was possible in the 21st century,"" she says, adding that the war ""must be stopped.""

Liz Cheney of Wyoming on Sunday said Russia's missile strike on an eastern Ukraine railway station last week that killed dozens of civilians ""clearly is genocide."" ""I think that Europe needs to understand and grapple with the fact that you've got a genocidal campaign, the first kind of horrific genocidal campaign that we have seen, certainly in recent decades,"" she told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" Cheney added that European countries need to ""understand that they're funding that genocidal campaign"" through the purchase of oil and gas from Russia, and should place an embargo on Russian oil and gas. At least 50 people, including five children, were killed and nearly 100 more were wounded on Friday from a Russian missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk where they were waiting to evacuate, Ukrainian officials said Friday. World leaders condemned the attack and the US State Department called it ""yet another example of the Russian government's unjustified brutal war sowing senseless death and destruction in Ukraine."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russian forces of committing genocide in his country, pointing to the bombing of a maternity and children's hospital and apparent brutal executions of civilians in Bucha, Ukraine. The Biden administration has accused Russia of war crimes and is supporting investigations into Russia's actions in Ukraine by helping document atrocities, but has stopped short of calling the killings a ""genocide."" The United Nations defines genocide as ""acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" including ""killing members of the group,"" ""causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group,"" and ""deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part."" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday downplayed the significance of ""the label"" of genocide in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""In my opinion, the label is less important than the fact that these acts are cruel and criminal and wrong and evil, and need to be responded to decisively, and that is what we are doing,"" Sullivan said when pressed by Tapper on the Russian killing of civilians in Ukraine. In a separate interview with ABC's ""This Week,"" Sullivan said the administration views the attribution as a legal distinction. ""That is a determination that we work through systematically,"" he said. ""There is a unit at the State Department that gathers evidence and then makes a legal analysis, because genocide is actually a legal determination."" Appearing on ""State of the Union,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told CNN that ""it is clear that Putin is systematically targeting civilians,"" saying that's why Canada has supported an International Criminal Court investigation into war crimes. Asked by Tapper if Russia's actions in Ukraine constitutes genocide, Trudeau said, ""Those are the things that will be determined."" ""Obviously, the messages we're seeing, the stories of what Russian soldiers are doing, not just the murder of civilians, but the systematic use of sexual violence and rape, to destabilize and have the greatest negative impact on Ukrainian people as possible is absolutely unforgivable and unacceptable,"" he added.",13,2.704232907473682,5.47940457663912,-2.775171669165438,19
2022-04-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/politics/finland-sweden-nato-membership/index.html,"Finland and Sweden could soon join NATO, prompted by Russian war in Ukraine","Finland and Sweden could soon join NATO, moves that would likely infuriate Moscow and that officials say would further underscore Russia's strategic error in invading Ukraine. NATO officials told CNN that discussions about Sweden and Finland joining the bloc have gotten extremely serious since Russia's invasion, and US senior State Department officials said the matter came up at this week's NATO foreign ministerial, which was attended by the foreign ministers from Stockholm and Helsinki. Officials said the discussions underline the extent to which Vladimir Putin's invasion has only served to reinvigorate and unify the NATO alliance -- the exact opposite of Putin's stated goals before the war began. The Russian President had demanded that NATO cease expanding east and admitting new members, accusing the bloc of threatening Russian security. Instead, NATO has increased its support to Ukraine and is preparing to welcome new members. Significant shifts in public opinion Public opinion in both countries about joining the defensive alliance has shifted significantly as Russia's war in Ukraine wages on, with one former Finnish Prime Minister telling CNN the move to join ""was pretty much a done deal on the 24th of February, when Russia invaded."" ""If you look at public opinion in Finland and Sweden, and how their views have changed dramatically over the past six weeks, I think it's another example of how this has been a strategic failure,"" one senior US State Department official said this week. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Friday that her country's Parliament is set to discuss possible NATO membership ""within the coming weeks,"" adding that she hopes these discussions will wrap up ""before midsummer."" ""I think we will have very careful discussions, but we are also not taking any more time than we have to in this process, because the situation is, of course, very severe,"" she said. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson did not rule out the possibility of membership in an interview with SVT at the end of March. Sweden is undertaking an analysis of security policy that's due to be completed by the end of May, and the government is expected to announce its position following that report, a Swedish official told CNN. They said their nation could make its position public sooner, depending on when neighboring Finland does. Finland's ambassador to the US, Mikko Hautala, told CNN the two nations are in close coordination with each other but that each country would make its own independent decision. 'Rethink the fundamentals' A Finnish official said Friday that their country would not be seeking to join NATO out of ""desperation"" for defense from the 30-member alliance. Rather, Moscow's actions in Ukraine have forced Finland ""to rethink the fundamentals."" ""And we do understand that our relations with this Russia that now exists, they can't be the same as they used to be due to these Russian actions,"" the official said. Alexander Stubb, who served as Finland's Prime Minister in 2014-2015, echoed this sentiment, telling CNN there had long been a tension in the country between idealism -- wanting to be able to work with Russia, with whom it shares a border -- and realism, which required Finland to maintain a strong standing army in the event that Russia ever invaded. That idealism has now largely evaporated in the wake of Russia's attack. ""The Finns think that if Putin can slaughter his sisters, brothers and cousins in Ukraine, as he is doing now, then there is nothing stopping him from doing it in Finland. We simply don't want to be left alone again,"" Stubb said, recalling the Soviet-Finnish Winter War, which lasted from November 1939 to March 1940. Possibility of a Kremlin response The Kremlin said Thursday it would have to ""rebalance the situation"" if Sweden and Finland were to join NATO. ""We'll have to make our western flank more sophisticated in terms of ensuring our security,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Sky News. Finland was hit with two cyberattacks and an airspace violation by a Russian state-owned plane on Friday. Both Stubb and the Finnish official said Helsinki expects such types of attacks, and they downplayed the potential of a severe response from Moscow should Finland -- which shares a more than 800-mile border with Russia -- join NATO. However, some NATO countries are looking at the possibility of Russia carrying out an attack before Finland falls under the protections of the alliance, according to a European official. ""We will be very live to the possibility that Russia may try to do something before they join the alliance,"" the official said. And the Finnish official acknowledged they ""have to be prepared, if our country will decide to apply or even if they don't, the situation is not safe, stable. ... We have a war, we have all kinds of possibilities."" They said there have been signals from other countries that they would offer support if there were security concerns in the interim between application and ratification of NATO membership. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this week that ""on the interim period, I'm certain that we will find ways to address concerns they may have regarding the period between the potential application, and the final ratification."" The Pentagon said Friday there have been no requests for assistance from either country, but ""if a country calls and asks for the United States' support, certainly we'll take that under consideration."" 'A member without being a member' Stoltenberg said that Sweden and Finland ""can easily join this alliance if they decide to apply,"" noting they ""have worked together for many years, we know that they meet the NATO standards when it comes to interoperability, democratic control over the armed forces."" The Finnish official noted that their country is essentially already ""a member without being a member."" Privately, NATO and US officials say they would be thrilled to see Finland and Sweden join the bloc. Those countries already have extremely close relationships with NATO and would be a huge asset, NATO officials told CNN, especially when it comes to intelligence sharing. While the level of intelligence sharing among Finland, Sweden and NATO has increased dramatically since the start of the war, one NATO official said, it is not at the level it would be if the countries were members of the bloc. A European official noted that Finland and Sweden, should they join, would both be ""net contributors"" to NATO, given their supply of advanced fighter jets. Finland already operates Boeing F/A-18s and has ordered 64 Lockheed Martin F-35s. Some officials even commented ironically that it would be one of the best things Putin has done to harden European security. ""Just imagine in however many months going from a NATO alliance that is 30 to 32 members strong,"" another senior State Department official told reporters following the foreign ministerial in Brussels. ""How this can be anything but a massive strategic blunder for Putin? That was a topic of conversation and multiple sessions over the past couple of days.""",29,4.167834325104331,5.891932962218131,-1.7240986371137996,13
2022-04-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/europe/kramatorsk-railway-station-strike-intl/index.html,Dozens killed in train station missile strike in eastern Ukraine as civilians try to flee Russian onslaught,"At least 50 people, including five children, were killed after Russian forces carried out a missile strike on a railway station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, that was being used by civilians trying to flee the fighting, Ukrainian officials said Friday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the regional military administration in Donetsk, where the attack took place, said that 98 wounded people -- 16 children, 46 were women and 36 men -- were taken to local hospitals. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier that nearly 300 people were wounded in the strike. In an address to Finland's parliament on Friday, Zelensky said that the ""Russian military hit the railway terminal,"" adding: ""There are witnesses, there are videos, there are remnants of the missiles and dead people."" He said that ""people (were) crowded waiting for the trains to be evacuated to the safe territory"" at the station. ""Why do they need to hit civilians with missiles? Why this cruelty that the world has witnessed in Bucha and other cities liberated by the Ukrainian army?"" Zelensky asked lawmakers. Local police said in a statement that the rockets struck a temporary waiting room, where ""hundreds of people were waiting for the evacuation train."" ""This is another proof that Russia is brutally, barbarically killing the civilian Ukrainians, with one goal only -- to kill,"" the mayor of Kramatorsk said in a statement. The mayor said that some 8,000 people per day were going to the station to evacuate during the last two weeks. As many as 4,000 people were there when the missile struck. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the attack a ""deliberate slaughter."" ""Russians knew that the train station in Kramatorsk was full of civilians waiting to be evacuated,"" he said. The Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement Friday calling the missile strike a ""provocation,"" in a statement that mirrored recent denials of the indiscriminate killing of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. ""All the statements of representatives of the Kyiv nationalist regime about the alleged 'missile attack' by Russia on April 8 at the railway station in Kramatorsk are a provocation and absolutely do not correspond to reality,"" the statement said. ""On April 8, the Russian armed forces did not conduct or plan any artillery fires in the city of Kramatorsk. We emphasize that the Tochka-U tactical missiles, the wreckage of which was found near the Kramatorsk railway station and published by eyewitnesses, are used only by the Ukrainian armed forces."" Ukrainian forces have the Soviet-designed Tochka missile in their inventory but it has also been used by Russian and separatist forces in the past. Russia's military and senior officials have issued blanket denials of attacks against civilians, most recently claiming -- without evidence -- that the massacre of civilians in Bucha was staged. The killing of civilians during the Russian occupation of the town has been extensively documented. The eastern city of Kramatorsk was one of the first places to be targeted by the Russian military when the invasion of Ukraine was launched on February 24. Ihnatchenko said Ukrainians had been using the train station since late February to evacuate the region. ""The Russians knew that thousands of people are there (at the train station) every day,"" she said. Two missiles struck the station, according to the head of Ukraine's national rail system, Oleksandr Kamyshin. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, said the Russian military used Iskander short-range ballistic missiles. CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour said the attack was reminiscent of one on a marketplace in Sarajevo during the war in Bosnia, where ""ordinary civilians were massacred as they just went about their business."" Amanpour said such attacks on civilians tend to harden Western resolve and could push the European Union to enact even more sanctions on Russia. Brussels has already approved five rounds of sanctions against Russia since it invaded Ukraine. The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, condemned the ""indiscriminate attack,"" while EU President Charles Michel called it ""horrifying."" ""This is yet another attempt to close escape routes for those fleeing this unjustified war and cause human suffering,"" Borrell said. Borrell and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Zelensky this week in Kyiv. The attack comes as Russian forces are preparing for a massive operation in eastern Ukraine to take the contested region of Donbas, Ukrainian authorities say. Donbas is home to the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, two separatist enclaves that Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized as independent shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine. For almost eight years, the two regions have been the site of a low-intensity war between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces. More than 14,000 people died in the fighting, and now Kyiv is bracing for more casualties. Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said the ""battle for Donbas"" is already underway. He said that the fighting there will be reminiscent of the destructive battles during World War II, as Moscow's offensive could involve ""thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, planes, artillery."" British intelligence assesses that Russian troops have ""fully withdrawn"" from northern Ukraine to Belarus and Russia, and many could be transferred to eastern Ukraine to fight in Donbas. Ukrainian military officials also say they have observed a buildup of Russian forces to the east.",17,5.381374886123083,7.93264748600243,-2.551272599879347,29
2022-04-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/politics/us-bases-europe-nato-russia-ukraine/index.html,US readies for long-term European security ramp-up after Russia's invasion,"The top US military general this week endorsed creating permanent US bases in Eastern Europe as a response to Russia's attack on Ukraine, saying that American bases on NATO's eastern flank would act as a deterrent to Moscow. The comments from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley were the most public indication to date of how the Biden administration could fundamentally alter the US security presence in Eastern Europe in order to reassure nervous NATO allies following Russia's attack on Ukraine. But Milley's recommendation came with a twist: He said he didn't think the US needed to permanently station troops at those bases to create an effective deterrent. ""I believe a lot of our European allies, especially those such as in the Baltics or Poland or Romania or elsewhere, they are very, very willing to establish permanent bases,"" Milley said to lawmakers during congressional testimony. ""They'll build them, they'll pay for them, etc., for us to cycle through on a rotational basis. So you get the effect of permanent presence of forces, but the actual individual soldiers, sailors, airmen or Marines are not permanently stationed there for 2-3 years."" Milley's assessment reflects the balance the Biden administration is aiming to strike as it works within the NATO alliance to bolster European security -- while keeping a sharp focus on the threat posed by China in the Pacific. The Pentagon's $773 billion budget proposal released last week indicates how the US military still sees China as its primary strategic challenge. While the budget was largely prepared before Russia's invasion, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said last week that the budget ""prioritizes China as the pacing challenge"" while it recognizes the ""acute threat posed by Russia."" The two countries pose different threats: China's economy is significantly larger than Russia's, with economic power to challenge the United States directly, though it's still unclear how willing Beijing would be to use its rapidly expanding military in conflict with another major country. Russia, however, has shown a willingness to use its military to achieve its aims -- the full-scale invasion of Ukraine comes after previous military incursions into both Ukraine and Georgia. ""We're in the midst of a change from two decades of counterinsurgency to near-peer competition. The thought was that the only major competition would be China, but now we're looking at two main competitors,"" Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, told CNN. It's too soon to say whether the tens of thousands of new US forces that have deployed to Europe over the past two months mark the beginning of a permanent expanded US presence on NATO's eastern flank to try to prevent future Russian aggression -- or if the current focus on Europe will subside when the war ends, returning the US military's primary attention toward the Pacific. Still, US and NATO officials say things will never go back to the way they were before Russian President Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine, which sparked the biggest land war in Europe since World War II. The surge of military forces into Eastern Europe -- and the weapons freely flowing from NATO countries to Ukraine to be used in the fight against Russian forces -- have kicked off what's likely to be long-term commitments to security and spending from numerous NATO countries. Military and Pentagon officials, lawmakers and military experts say that while NATO is doing its best to stay directly out of Russia's war in Ukraine, the alliance is going to have to make key decisions over whether it should act in ways that risk escalating tensions with Russia, such as admitting new members like Sweden or Finland. Last month, Moscow threatened both countries against joining NATO. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that the US is discussing with NATO what has changed since Russia's attack on Ukraine and how to account for it. ""This unlawful and unprovoked aggression by Putin has the effect of changing the security architecture in the region for some time to come,"" Austin said. ""We do expect that it will change our footprint. In terms of how much it changes the US contribution, that's left to be seen."" 'It's a wake-up call' The decisions the Biden administration makes regarding US security posture toward Russia will chart the direction of a military that's pivoting from 20 years of Middle Eastern wars and counterinsurgency to a new phase focused on military competition with China and Russia. The degree to which the military turns its focus to Europe could help determine the future of an Army that's slated to shrink slightly in the next year and a Marine Corps whose future role in the US military is now the subject of considerable debate as it readies a reorganization. ""I do think this is a very protracted conflict,"" Milley said of the war in Ukraine. ""And I think it's at least measured in years, I don't know about decade, but at least years, for sure. This is a very extended conflict that Russia has initiated."" Austin has been adding troops and assets to the region since Russia's invasion, increasing the overall number of US troops in Europe from 60,000 to about 100,000. Gen. Tod Wolters, commander of US European Command, said during a congressional hearing last week that the Russian invasion is an unfortunate catalyst for an overdue reevaluation of the permanent military presence on the continent. ""It's got to change, and certainly this is an opportunity as a result of this senseless act on behalf of Russia to reexamine the permanent military architecture that exists not only in Eastern Europe, but in our air policing activity in aviation and in our standing naval maritime groups,"" Wolters said. Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Biden administration's initial inclination before the Ukraine war to focus primarily on China is likely to shift. ""I think there was a very strong sense in their strategy that China was the 'pacing threat,' as they called it -- everything else would have to be secondary,"" he said. ""Now that's clearly not the case."" House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat, said he didn't think that an added emphasis on Russia needed to come at the expense of countering China. ""I think we can do both. That's what the budget debate and the defense strategy debate is going to be about,"" Smith told CNN. ""I think it's pretty clear that we're ready for a more robust force posture in Eastern Europe with our NATO partners, without question."" Republicans have accused the Biden administration of shortchanging its proposed 2023 Pentagon budget, which would increase by roughly $30 billion compared with the current fiscal year, saying more funding is needed in part to provide better deterrence against Russia. ""It's a wake-up call,"" said Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""There's still a lot of liberal people around who don't think there's any real threat out there. I think that has done away with that."" A larger permanent European presence US officials say Putin miscalculated how NATO would respond to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Projecting unity, European countries that rely on Russian energy joined in on crippling sanctions against Moscow, and several countries that had previously been on the sidelines have provided weapons to Ukraine. It's a notable shift from President Donald Trump's time in office, when he questioned the value of the alliance, claiming members were not contributing enough defense funds, and when he pushed to withdraw US troops from Germany. But the alliance still faces hard, potentially fractious, choices ahead. While Ukraine has seemingly put off the prospect of joining NATO, other countries like Sweden and Finland could be incentivized to do so, fearing the prospect of widening Russian aggression and seeking the protection of the alliance's Article 5 commitment to defend member countries from attack. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that both Finland and Sweden could be welcomed into the alliance if they want to do so. ""We have a good dialogue with the Finnish political leadership, with the Finnish President, also with Sweden,"" Stoltenberg said. ""And, of course, it's for them to decide. But if they apply, I expect that they will be very much welcomed by all 30 allies, and that we will find ways to do that in a relatively quick way, to take them into the alliance, if they so want."" Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Russia's aggression has ""refocused"" NATO on promoting the security of its core countries. ""NATO in some ways finds its original purpose, and in some ways becomes an easier organization to hold together,"" he said. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion, NATO has agreed to establish four more battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. Those forces add to the battle groups that were established by NATO in 2017 in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, meaning NATO now has forces deployed all along its Eastern European flank. Battle groups are military forces from different NATO countries that train and are stationed together so that, if a conflict arises, they are prepared as a united NATO force. Wolters, who also serves as NATO's supreme allied commander Europe, said during last week's hearing that he believes a new US military presence on the continent will be strongly supported by NATO allies. This week, Austin approved the extension of deployments of US military members from the 82nd Airborne Division in Poland, about 7,000 troops and their support elements, and the USS Harry S Truman carrier strike group stationed in the Mediterranean. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said both groups will stay ""for a while longer,"" during a news briefing last week. ""No matter how this war ends, no matter when it ends, the security environment in Europe is going to be different. And we're going to have to respond to that,"" Kirby said. ""But we're going to stay open to having those kinds of conversations too, about whether there needs to be ... a larger permanent presence on the European continent.""",29,7.008684681180033,5.527025762879204,1.4816589183008286,9

Geolocation of a video posted to Twitter shows the body on the street. News photos taken on the ground later show painted red nails on the dead woman's hand and a heart shape on her ring finger. A makeup artist posted photos to Instagram of Iryna Filkina, 53, with the heart on her fingernail. Filkina had enrolled in the makeup artist's class before Russia invaded. Filkina's daughters, who fled to Poland, recognized their mother's hand in the photos that spread across the internet. When Russia invaded, Filkina stayed behind, helping people in Bucha and cooked for the Ukrainian military, according to her daughter. She got the red manicure for Valentine's Day and drew ""a heart on her finger because she started to love herself,"" her daughter Subacheva told CNN. CNN's Tara John, Oleksandra Ochman, Eoin McSweeney and Gianluca Mezzofiore put the pieces together in a remarkable report. Read it. Germans also gathering evidence The evidence of war crimes is coming not just from drones and social media, but also from intelligence. RELATED: Drone video team turns the tables on hiding Russian vehicle This is from a CNN report on German intelligence about intercepted Russian radio communications: Der Spiegel reported that the BND, Germany's foreign intelligence agency, intercepted Russian radio chatter about the killing of civilians in Bucha, and that some of the conversations could be tied directly to specific killings in Bucha that have been documented since news first emerged of an apparent massacre there. German intelligence has satellite images that point to the involvement of Russian troops in the Bucha killings, the Washington Post reported, citing an unnamed intelligence official, though the paper said the radio transmissions have not been linked to that location. Russia's disinformation campaign continues Russia is also apparently trying to tell its own story by hacking into the social media accounts of Ukrainian soldiers, according to Facebook parent company Meta. From CNN's report: The tactics the groups are using, according to Meta, include posing as journalists and independent news outlets online to push Russian talking points, attempting to hack dozens of Ukrainian soldiers' Facebook accounts, and running coordinated campaigns to try to get posts by critics of Russia removed from social media. Meta said a hacking group known as ""Ghostwriter,"" which cyber experts believe is linked to Belarus, attempted to hack into the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukrainian military personnel. Reporting on atrocities Meanwhile, photos and reporting from on the ground in Ukraine are documenting what is actually happening. Julia Kochetova is a Ukrainian photographer who has stayed to cover the war. She told CNN's Jim Sciutto and Poppy Harlow from Kyiv Thursday about how she separates the important mission of documenting atrocities from the pain of witnessing them. ""As a Ukrainian, as a citizen, as a photojournalist, I'm continuing to do my job. But I also had a strong feeling that it's not enough just to witness what's happening, what the crime against humanity is happening with my country, but also to document that crime."" It is important, she said, that Ukrainian journalists are bringing these images to the world. ""I still have a strong belief we need to highlight local voices because Ukrainian photographers on the ground, they have the real perspective, real balance and real truth. Because we know not only the context, not only the language -- that's our war; that's our country."" Russia rebuked by the UN Perceptions of reality are incredibly important in this war. Ukraine and Western countries have effectively marshaled most of the world against Russia by showing the invasion to be unjust, illegal and built on lies about Ukraine. The United Nations voted Thursday to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. ""The General Assembly has sent a crystal-clear message to Russia's leadership that a government whose military is routinely committing horrific rights violations has no business on the UN Human Rights Council,"" said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch, with a call for the UN and International Criminal Court to gather evidence and hold war crimes trials. ""Gruesome images from Bucha have shocked people around the world. Victims and their families deserve to see those responsible held to account."" Groundwork for war crimes trial Charbonneau's comments brought to mind the issue of war crimes and how they can be prosecuted. This conflict will be different in that it has been so meticulously documented. That drone and satellite images can immediately refute Russian claims about when bodies were left on the streets in Bucha is a remarkable thing. Organizations like Bellingcat, the Netherlands-based investigative journalism group, are using satellite and social media to document war crimes and identify their perpetrators. A former ICC prosecutor, James Goldston, who is now with the Open Society Justice Initiative, recently told me for an earlier newsletter that war crimes trials will be built like any other criminal case -- from the bottom up -- and will rely on documentation. ""Often international criminal investigations begin with the 'crime base' -- authenticated images, witness testimonies and other evidence concerning killings, torture, rape or other prohibited offenses which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity -- and proceed upward along a chain of military or political authority to demonstrate the culpability of those who ordered, or who knew of but failed to prevent/punish, the commission of such crimes,"" Goldston said. Perhaps the hyperconnectivity of the world we live in will help lead to some accountability for those threatening the world we live in.",13,7.709583928230703,2.752466861978276,4.957117066252428,19

The voting result was 93 in favor, 24 against and 58 abstentions. A draft of the resolution says the General Assembly may ""suspend the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council of a member of the Council that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights."" The draft resolution adds that the council has ""grave concern"" regarding reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" and ""violations of international humanitarian law"" committed by the Russian Federation during its invasion of Ukraine. The General Assembly needed to vote in favor by two-thirds of the countries present and voting to remove Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. The measure suspends Russia's membership in the Council and would launch a review of the matter if the UN deems it appropriate. The United States ambassador to the United Nations made a case for seeking the suspension of Russia from the Human Rights Council in front of the UN Security Council on Tuesday, something she and other UN member states have been pushing. ""Russia should not have a position of authority in a body whose purpose -- whose very purpose -- is to promote respect for human rights. Not only is it the height of hypocrisy -- it is dangerous,"" Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. ""Every day, we see more and more how little Russia respects human rights,"" she said. Ultimately she argued, ""Russia's participation on the Human Rights Council hurts the Council's credibility. It undermines the entire UN. And it is just plain wrong."" The Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, ahead of the vote on Thursday called on all United Nations member states to support the resolution suspending Russia from the council. ""Now the world has come to a crucial juncture. We witness that our liner is going through treacherous fog towards deadly icebergs. It might seem that we should have named it the Titanic instead of the Human Rights Council. ... We need to take an action today to save the council from sinking,"" Kyslytsya said. The Ukrainian ambassador said Russia's actions in Ukraine ""would be equated to war crimes and crimes against humanity."" While he noted that a vote to suspend a country from the Human Rights Council is ""a rare and extraordinary action,"" he said ""Russia's actions are beyond the pale."" In response, the deputy Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Gennady Kuzmin, called on member states to reject the resolution, saying it would set a ""a dangerous precedent."" ""Today is not the time nor the place for theatrics, or these kinds of extremely theatrical performances like the one presented by Ukraine. In fact the draft resolution we are considering today has no relationship to the actual human rights situation on the ground,"" Kuzmin said. The Russian representative said the vote on suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council ""is an attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and total control to continue its attempt at human rights colonialism in international relations."" Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement that Russia's suspension sends ""a crystal-clear message"" that they have ""no business"" on the council. ""The General Assembly has sent a crystal-clear message to Russia's leadership that a government whose military is routinely committing horrific rights violations has no business on the UN Human Rights Council,"" Charbonneau said. ""Gruesome images from Bucha have shocked people around the world. Victims and their families deserve to see those responsible held to account. Investigators from the UN and International Criminal Court should set the wheels of justice in motion by moving swiftly to gather and preserve evidence of war crimes.""

What is Putin's plan for eastern Ukraine?,"As Russia's war in Ukraine enters a pivotal new phase, fighting is intensifying in the east of the country and officials have warned of a battle that ""will remind you of the Second World War."" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Thursday that fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine was ramping up but that it ""has not reached its maximum scale."" ""The battle for Donbas will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations, maneuvers, involvement of thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, planes, artillery. This will not be a local operation based on what we see in Russia's preparations,"" Kuleba said at a news conference in Brussels. ""Russia has its plan, we have ours, and the battlefield will decide the outcome,"" he added. Over the next few weeks, officials expect Russian forces to resupply and reposition with the aim of launching a brutal new offensive in Donbas, which encompasses the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday. ""We now see a significant movement of troops away from Kyiv to regroup, re-arm and re-supply, and a shift in focus to the east,"" he told reporters in Brussels.""This is a crucial phase of the war."" Already, much of the region has come under an unrelenting assault. Russian forces are trying to wipe the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol ""off the face of the earth,"" a Ukrainian military commander currently in Mariupol told CNN on Wednesday night. Serhiy Volyna, Deputy Commander of the Marine Battalion in Mariupol, who has been fighting in the region since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, called the situation ""critical."" ""It is a humanitarian catastrophe. The military that were involved in active hostilities here are completely surrounded. There are supply problems with water, food, medication and general supply. It's a very difficult situation."" ""We have been encircled in Mariupol for more than 40 days. The enemy outnumbers us and in terms of weaponry, their artillery, they have sea-based artillery, tanks, armored vehicles and of course mortars. It is difficult for us,"" Volyna said. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on Wednesday also listed the cities of Volnovakha, Izium and Popasna as places where there have been ""allegations of numerous civilian casualties."" Russian troops carried out 27 strikes on residential areas of the northeastern city of Kharkiv on Tuesday night, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration, Oleg Synegubov, said in a statement on Telegram. Taking control of Mariupol would allow Russia to create a land corridor linking Crimea to Donbas, allowing troops to freely move from the southern peninsula to boost its units on the mainland. But Russian troops have not yet been able to break through Ukrainian resistance across the east. They will likely attempt to encircle Ukrainian fighters in the east in the coming weeks, and whether or not they are able to do so could be crucial in determining the course of the war. Russia reverts course Since the war began, Russia has deployed a devastating array of aerial assaults across much of the country -- using hugely destructive missile and artillery fire that extended well into the central and western parts of the country. But a stuttering ground campaign and a series of military setbacks -- particularly around the capital Kyiv and in the north -- mean Moscow has made far less progress in capturing ground than most analysts expected. Russian fighters moved out of the Kyiv region this week after Ukrainian troops regained control of the area containing the capital, while Russia has also failed to achieve complete air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses of personnel since the start of the invasion. Now, Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to be changing tack. Putin has revised his war strategy to focus on trying to take control of Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine with a target date of early May, according to several US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments. To achieve that goal, Stoltenberg said NATO is expecting Russia to conduct a ""very concentrated"" attack in the east aimed at capturing the entire Donbas region. It's too soon to say whether Putin has permanently abandoned his goal of taking Kyiv and overpowering resistance across Ukraine. But his shift in focus follows a series of losses elsewhere in the country that have stalled his invasion and stretched his forces. Key new battlegrounds Russian troops now are expected to try to cut off Ukrainian forces in the east and link up their troops across the region. That means attention will likely soon turn to the city of Sloviansk, with an advance from Russian units from Izium to the north. ""Efforts by Russian forces advancing from Izyum to capture Slovyansk will likely prove to be the next pivotal battle of the war in Ukraine,"" the Washington DC-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in its Monday update on the conflict in Ukraine. Its report uses alternative transliterations of Ukrainian place names. A successful Russian assault on the city would give Moscow the option to link troops up with those fighting in Rubizhne, to the northeast of Sloviansk, or move them south, towards Horlivka and Donetsk, in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian fighters there, the group added. But ""if Russian forces are unable to take Slovyansk at all, Russian frontal assaults in Donbas are unlikely to independently breakthrough Ukrainian defenses and Russia's campaign to capture the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts will likely fail,"" the ISW said. Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to the Interior Minister of Ukraine, agreed Thursday that the ""the most difficult situation"" Ukraine now faces is in the country's east, where Ukrainian military officials say they have observed a buildup of Russian forces. ""Unfortunately, the Russians continue to do everything they did before in Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, and so on -- to destroy civilian infrastructure,"" he said. ""The situation now is very difficult in the direction of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk,"" Denysenko said. ""These are the key points at this stage of this war. I believe, in fact, the results of at least this stage of this war will largely depend on the fighting in the east."" What is the situation in the east now? Cities across eastern Ukraine have suffered sustained and devastating Russian assaults for several weeks. Mariupol, at the southern tip of the Donetsk oblast, has been particularly decimated and has come to serve as a symbol of the brutality of Russia's war. In a roundtable on Wednesday, Mariupol Mayor Vadim Boychenko said more than 90% of the city's infrastructure has been destroyed by Russia and that at least 40% of that is ""no longer recoverable."" 5,000 people have died in the city in the first month of the invasion, including around 210 children, Boychenko said, citing preliminary estimates. The humanitarian situation in Mariupol is meanwhile ""growing worse and worse,"" International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) spokesperson Lucile Marbeau told CNN on Wednesday. ""Right now, there is nothing, no water, no electricity, barely any connection,"" Marbeau said. But Mariupol is not alone; Ukrainian officials said Wednesday that major fighting was underway across Ukraine's east, with the regional military governor of eastern Luhansk region urging civilians to evacuate some towns. Vadym Denysenko, adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Interior, said: ""If we talk about the key directions where combat will be ongoing -- it's the Sloviansk [Donetsk region] and Barvinkove [Kharkiv region] directions, in the Luhansk region it's in the Popasna and Rubizhne areas and, of course, in Mariupol."" Serhii Haidai, the military governor of the Luhansk region, issued a statement Wednesday calling for the evacuation of several towns in the region. ""The Russians are destroying the railway connections of Donetsk region,"" he said on Telegram. ""We will take everyone out if the Russians allow us to get to the gathering places,"" he said. ""As you can see, they do not always observe the 'ceasefire regime.'"" What does Putin want in eastern Ukraine? Pro-Russian separatists seized control of parts of the Donbas region in 2014, when Moscow reacted to protests that toppled a Kremlin-friendly Ukrainian president by fomenting a rebellion in eastern Ukraine. Fighting has endured there since. When Putin began his invasion by sending troops into eastern Ukraine on February 22, he claimed that protecting the people of Donbas from ""genocide"" by the Ukrainian authorities was among the motivations -- a false claim that was roundly dismissed by Ukraine and the international community. That followed days of baseless claims about Ukraine's sovereignty, and the decision by Russia to recognize two territories in Luhansk and Donetsk that were held by pro-Russian separatists. And since launching a full-scale war two days later, the supposed liberation of Donbas has played a central role in the rhetoric of the Kremlin. The first weeks of the invasion saw bombardments of cities and towns well beyond that part of Ukraine; Russia invaded from the north, east and south and focused much attention on Kyiv and other major cities, with strikes even reaching as far as Lviv in the far west of Ukraine. But the revised strategy sees Putin return attention to the region that was at the heart of his attempts to justify the invasion. The Russian Defense Ministry's daily summaries have sought to focus on successes in these regions and, over the past week, various Russian officials have described the Donbas region as the main goal of the operation, with other actions merely designed to pin down Ukrainian troops. ""In the coming weeks we expect a further Russian push in the east and southern Ukraine, to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to the occupied Crimea,"" Stoltenberg said on Tuesday. After six difficult weeks of war Putin is under pressure to demonstrate he can show a victory, and eastern Ukraine is the place where he is most likely to be able to quickly do that, several US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments said. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin is focused on May 9, Russia's ""Victory Day,"" according to one of the officials. But other officials note even if there is a Russian celebration, an actual victory may be further off. ""Putin will have a victory parade on 9th May regardless the status of the war or peace talks,"" a European defense official said. ""On the other hand: a victory parade with what troops and vehicles?""",14,6.870354117275456,2.604175411504836,4.26617870577062,21
2022-04-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/europe/ukraine-russia-war-technology-intl-cmd/index.html,"Drones, phones and satellite technology are exposing the truth about Russia's war in Ukraine in near real-time","Russia's lies may be catching up with it faster than it ever imagined. The war in Ukraine is defying President Vladimir Putin's expectations at every turn, not only with Russia's failure to capture Kyiv as planned but with the war crimes his soldiers are alleged to have committed in Bucha, a city close the capital, exposed for the world to see. Throughout history, wars have been won by forces turning new technologies to their advantage. The 1415 victory of English King Henry V over the French at the Battle of Agincourt came courtesy of his archers and their newly developed longbows, raining arrows over a range the French could not match. The war in Ukraine may see another historic first, with technology cutting through the fog of war, exposing the aggressors' lies and accelerating efforts to bring about their defeat. Satellite images of murdered civilians that match videos, recorded weeks later, of bodies at the roadside are providing compelling evidence of Russian war crimes, convincing Western leaders to ramp up sanctions on Russia and accelerate weapons supplies for Ukraine. How this will affect the final outcome of the war is unclear. But what is evident at a time when Ukraine is urgently seeking any additional leverage as Russian forces regroup for a new offensive, is that Russia's actions in Bucha are strengthening Ukraine's hand. While battlefield satellite imagery has been available to governments for decades and was instrumental in pinpointing war crimes during the Bosnian civil war in the 1990s -- notably locating a mass grave of many of the 7,000 Bosnian Muslims slaughtered in the town of Srebrenica in 1995 -- it has never been so immediately available in the public domain as now. Putin and his battlefield commanders appear not to care or not to have grasped the fact that orders and actions now leave an indelible record beyond their control that could come back to haunt them. They will be aware that in many past conflicts -- even as recent as the Syrian civil war -- leaders like Bashar al Assad escaped conviction and have even been rehabilitated, despite vast troves of incriminating documents spirited from government offices and police stations. But this is not the only lesson to which Putin should pay attention. Following the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia and the Bosnian civil war, the war crimes tribunal in the Hague used political and military leaders' own words to help convict them. When the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) put Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic on trial, it had video of him looking over Sarajevo, condemning the civilians below to artillery and mortar fire. His military partner in war crimes there, General Ratko Mladic, also saw his words come back to help convict him, as video showed him on the outskirts of Srebrenica directing the filtering of civilians, many of whom would shortly be slaughtered by his soldiers, following his orders. That type of link may be harder to pin on Putin, but his 20-page thesis published last summer on why Ukraine is not a country, and his TV comments on why Russia should invade, will, if previous war crime courts are a precedent, count against him as author and director of the war. If Putin were to come to trial, his unravelling may turn out to have begun with his inability to understand his army's weaknesses and Ukraine's strengths. Failure to fulfil his first major objective, the capture of Kyiv, forced his troops to retreat, leaving their tide of terror exposed. They did what they have done so many times before, in Syria, in Chechnya, in Georgia: committed awful abuses. And Putin and his officials did what they have done so many time before: lied to cover their crimes. Russian defense officials claimed photos and videos that emerged on April 2, showing murdered civilians -- shot in the head, some with their hands and legs bound -- were fake, saying their troops left before the killings occurred. ""The troops left the city on March 30,"" the defense ministry said in a statement. ""Where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake."" They were very clear about the date. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, one of Putin's most seasoned spin masters, doubled down on the clumsy cover-up, insisting ""Russian forces left the Bucha town area as early as the 30th of March."" But publicly available satellite images from space-tech company Maxar, taken March 18 while Russian troops were in control, showed the civilians lying dead at the road side in exactly the same locations as Ukrainian forces discovered them when they re-entered the town in early April. And drone video shot before March 10 showed a cyclist being shot and killed by Russian troops. Ukrainian forces found his body weeks later, exactly where he fell. In the months prior to Russia's invasion and the days since Maxar's images appeared, tracking Russian forces and their destruction, the public's understanding of the battlefield has been revolutionized. Coupled with the near-ubiquitous use of smartphone cameras, geolocation technology and sophisticated drones, Putin faces the possible reckoning he escaped in previous conflicts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants more cameras, and wider access, to let the public see for themselves: ""This is what we are interested in, maximum access for journalists, maximum cooperation with international institutions, enrolment of the International Criminal Court, complete truth and full accountability,"" he said in a video address on Monday. Ukraine's enigmatic leader has realized it's not just high-tech, tank-busting weapons like Javelins and NLAWs, or surface-to-air missiles like Stingers and Starstreaks, that could turn the tide in the war. It's truth, and the tools -- satellites, drones and smartphones -- to deliver it. Unparalleled in any modern war, technology could hand the underdog this surprising advantage, undermining the lies of an oversized aggressor. Zelensky was at pains for the United Nations to understand this when he spoke to them Tuesday: ""It is 2022 now. We have conclusive evidence. There are satellite images. And we can conduct full and transparent investigations."" Like Henry V in 1415, Zelensky knows an advantage when he sees it. While satellite imagery may not be as game-changing as a six-foot yew branch and a length of hemp string, if he can use it cleverly, he may force Putin to talks much sooner than the Russian President would like.",13,4.296367647523411,2.9802733120938414,1.3160943354295696,19
2022-04-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/europe/sloviansk-ukraine-russia-military-significance-intl/index.html,The fight for Sloviansk may be 'the next pivotal battle' of Russia's war in Ukraine,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been far costlier and less successful than most analysts expected over its first six weeks -- and experts now believe that Moscow is changing its military approach. President Vladimir Putin's revised war strategy will now focus on trying to take control of the Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine with a target date of early May, according to several US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments. That makes the city of Sloviansk, more than 300 miles east of the capital Kyiv, a potentially crucial battleground in the coming weeks. ""Efforts by Russian forces advancing from Izyum to capture Slovyansk will likely prove to be the next pivotal battle of the war in Ukraine,"" the Washington DC-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in its Monday update on the conflict in Ukraine. Its report uses alternative transliterations of Ukrainian place names. ISW expects Russian troops to begin offensive operations towards the city from nearby Izium in the coming days, a forecast that matches warnings on the ground. ""They go south to Kamyanka because it is the road to the city of Sloviansk,"" Max Strelnyk, a deputy in the Izium city council's office, told CNN late last week of Russian troops' plans. ""We have radio interceptions of their talks; their task is to capture the Donetsk region from the north."" On Wednesday, Vadym Denysenko, adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Interior, said: ""If we talk about the key directions where combat will be ongoing -- it's the Sloviansk [Donetsk region] and Barvinkove [Kharkiv region] directions."" Residents of Sloviansk, a city of just over 100,000 people before the invasion, are now being urged to evacuate, while Ukrainian forces are preparing to defend it from a new Russian onslaught. Control of the city has significant strategic importance in the wider conflict. Should Russian forces overrun Sloviansk, they would be able to cut off Ukraine's forces in the wider region. If they are held back by Ukrainian resistance, however, Russia's ambitions to control both the Luhansk and Donetsk regions will suffer a huge blow. Sloviansk's strategic importance Sloviansk was a major flashpoint in the war in the Donbas region in 2014, and was briefly held by pro-Russian separatists before they were pushed back by Ukrainian forces in July of that year. Its significance now lies primarily in the fact that it is surrounded on three sides by Russian-held cities -- Izium to the north, Luhansk to the east, and Donetsk to the south -- but lies deeper west in the Donbas region than the two latter locations, blocking Russia's pathways further into Ukrainian territory. ""Russian forces likely intend to cut off Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine and will need to take Slovyansk as their minimum step to do so,"" the ISW said. A successful Russian assault on the city would give Moscow the option to link troops up with those fighting in Rubizhne, to the northeast of Sloviansk, or move them south, towards Horlivka and Donetsk, in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian fighters there, the group added. But Russia appears to have encountered multiple military failures during the first six weeks of the invasion, and its inability to capture cities further west, such as the capital Kyiv, has likely prompted its renewed focus on the Donbas. In that context, a fresh Russian defeat in the face of Ukrainian resistance could imperil even their new strategy in the east. ""If Russian forces are unable to take Slovyansk at all, Russian frontal assaults in Donbas are unlikely to independently breakthrough Ukrainian defenses and Russia's campaign to capture the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts will likely fail,"" the ISW said. Humanitarian catastrophe looms Reinforced Russian troops currently driving from Izium towards Sloviansk are made up of elements from the 1st Guards Tank Army that had previously been in the Kharkiv-Sumy area to the north, the ISW said on Tuesday. They do not yet include the units that were withdrawn from the Kyiv region, the institute added. And, it said, the operation toward Sloviansk has ""continued on a small scale and made limited progress"" so far this week. But Russia may ramp up its assault on the city when more units become available. The citizens of Sloviansk were given an evacuation order on Monday, amid fears of a full-scale attack and an ensuing humanitarian catastrophe in the city. Such a fate has already descended on Izium, which has come under sustained Russian attack for weeks. On Monday a senior US defense official told reporters that Russian forces are ""still flying about more than 200 sorties a day,"" and ""most of their airstrikes are focusing on the Izium area."" ""Every day, it gets worse,"" Strelnyk told CNN of the humanitarian situation in Izium on Friday. ""There's been no pause in the bombing -- it started weeks ago -- by the Russians. Although Russia claims that they will decrease military operations in the Kyiv and Chernihiv oblasts, Izium and the greater Kharkiv region will have no such luck,"" Strelnyk said. ""In the city, the dead are buried in the central park of our city,"" he told CNN. Video footage that has been geolocated and had its authenticity verified by CNN showed dead bodies across the city's central park. On Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said major fighting was underway in Ukraine's east, with the regional military governor of eastern Luhansk region urging civilians to evacuate some towns. Sloviansk sits in the north of the bordering Donetsk region. But officials across the two regions have spoken of their difficulties in getting people out or aid in. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of attacking intended humanitarian corridors and bombing residents of cities as they fled. Ivan Fedorov, mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in the south, said Tuesday that Russian troops had been blocking the delivery of humanitarian supplies and hindering the evacuation of civilians. ""The situation with humanitarian corridors has not improved,"" Fedorov said in televised remarks. ""For the past two weeks, we managed to deliver only two humanitarian cargoes to Melitopol.""",14,2.6533581793220353,3.108012411756399,-0.45465423243436387,21
2022-04-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/politics/putin-ukraine-war-atrocities-western-punishment/index.html,The West is running out of ways to punish Putin,"Western outrage, new sanctions, and promised state-of-the-art weapons came too late to save the man found shot dead next to his bike on a grassy bank outside Kyiv. The man was pictured in a weekend of horrific imagery from Ukraine. He was one of many blameless civilians whose destiny randomly collided with President Vladimir Putin's barbaric invasion. Scenes being revealed as Russian troops pull back from Kyiv are causing searing flashbacks to atrocities last visited on Ukrainians by the Nazis in World War II. This is one snapshot of the bloody price Ukrainian civilians are paying for Putin's obsession with Russia's Cold War humiliation, and it encapsulates how global responses to crimes against humanity -- short of military action -- struggle to keep pace with a vicious on-the-ground war. The sense of revulsion about what is happening in Ukraine produced new momentum to hold Russia accountable on Monday. The European Union and Ukraine launched a new probe into potential war crimes in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where bodies were found strewn in the street. Members of Congress called on President Joe Biden to speed up the flow of weapons into Ukraine to beat back the invasion. The European Union is facing rising pressure to accept what would be a painful economic hit by totally cutting off Russian oil and coal exports. Biden reacted to the growing catalog of inhumanity on Monday by calling for more sanctions and for a war crimes trial to take place against Putin. ""You may remember I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal,"" Biden said. ""He is a war criminal. This guy is brutal."" But the awful tragedy being revealed in Ukraine is that all of the measures the West is prepared to contemplate to punish Moscow and impact the long-term course of the war cannot do much to save civilians being targeted now. And it is questionable whether any of the potential responses to the bloodlust by Putin's troops will sway the ruthless Russian leader anyway. The reflex for leaders to offer horrified condemnations, to demand accountability and to lash out at Putin is understandable. It's also critical for the world not to be numbed into acceptance. But the West is unlikely to halt Putin's campaign of atrocities in the short term -- especially since the Russian leader has proven immune from moral outrage. And given the scale of carnage already committed, including attacks on apartment blocks, hospitals and bomb shelters, he also appears to have long passed the point of any restraint. New momentum for fresh punishments for Russia followed a weekend in which harrowing footage emerged of civilians shot dead, some execution-style, in Bucha. A CNN team also observed a mass grave in the town on Sunday and witnessed the removal of bodies from a basement on Monday. Ukraine warned Monday that such scenes may be the ""tip of the iceberg,"" and President Volodymyr Zelensky said worse atrocities were being uncovered. ""There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities,"" said Zelensky, who will address the UN Security Council on Tuesday morning. ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago."" Putin knows the West's limits The toughest sanctions ever, Russia's new status as a global pariah and its cultural, diplomatic, economic and sporting isolation haven't stopped the Kremlin strongman yet. Given Putin's apparently secure political position, he shows no concern at being labeled a war criminal, and the chances of him standing trial are remote barring staggering political change in Russia. Russia's contempt for the notion of accountability, meanwhile, shone through its absurd claims that scenes of the decomposed bodies being pulled from the basement and images of civilians apparently killed execution-style were staged by the Ukrainians. Armed with the world's largest stockpile of nuclear warheads, Putin understands that the West is unwilling to intervene directly in Ukraine and risk a disastrous clash with Russia with measures like a no-fly zone to save civilians. He is offering a lesson in why other dictators might consider pursuing nuclear arms. The kind of Western interventions to save civilians in places like Kosovo or Libya are prohibited in Ukraine, simply because of the implied power of the Russian leader's arsenal -- and his saber rattling earlier in the war. Eighty years after dictators like Adolf Hitler in Germany or Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union spread terror inside and outside their countries, Putin is creating an awful new spectacle for the 21st century -- that of a dictator who cannot be deterred. A special kind of impunity Putin's willingness to absorb punishments already clamped on Russia over the invasion gave him a special kind of impunity. Sanctions on the Russian economy and oligarchs may have a debilitating impact in the long term. But they have clearly failed as a tool of deterrence. The Russian leader has also appeared willing to tolerate heavy casualties among his troops in the face of heroic resistance from Ukrainian forces. The recalibration of Russian strategy to trying to consolidate control of eastern regions may, however, show even Putin can be moved by events over time. From the outside, the war is a military, diplomatic and economic disaster for Russia after its failure to seize key objectives. But it can still be a perverse success for Putin if his goal is simply to destroy as much of Ukraine as possible and create a victory parade for Russian state media. So in many ways, he's playing an asymmetric game with the West, whose sanctions and punitive measures are based on a more logical view of Russia's interests and its own limitations. Still, the White House reacted to the horror emerging from Ukraine by promising to quicken the pace of military, humanitarian and economic aid to Kyiv. ""The images from Bucha so powerfully reinforce now is not the time for complacency,"" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday. Such help could shorten the war and alleviate attacks on civilians in weeks and months to come. But Putin has been besieging and bombarding Ukrainian cities for weeks. Millions of people were already driven out of the country into Western Europe as refugees. A Nuremberg-style trial? Momentum is also growing for some kind of formal mechanism to hold Russian leaders accountable for war crimes. Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday that the invasion was the biggest disaster in Europe since World War II, and merited a system of justice similar to the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals. ""We need to prepare right now. We need to urgently launch a kind of joint investigative group in order to be prepared to bring to justice Putin and to see Putin sitting behind ... bars."" But the nature of the post-Cold War international system would complicate the establishment of a system that enjoyed global legitimacy. Russia, for instance, would be certain to veto any attempt to involve the United Nations with its Security Council vote. China would also seek to derail any effort to impose accountability for human rights abuses given its own repression of Uyghur Muslims that the United States has branded a genocide. Still, the difficulty of bringing Putin to justice does not mean that Russians lower in the chain of command cannot be investigated, though the International Criminal Court in The Hague doesn't conduct trials in absentia. The organization does, however, already have investigations in Ukraine, which has accepted its jurisdiction even though it's not a member of the court. One potentially significant new blow against Russia could come from Europe as the European Union draws up new sanctions. French President Emmanuel Macron backed a ban on Russian coal and oil exports to the EU as soon as this week. But it's doubtful whether other big powers, including Germany, would go that far, given the energy shortages and spikes to already high inflation that would result. Such a move would undoubtedly make strides in starving funding for the war in Ukraine. But in the shorter term, it would also beg two questions: Is Putin even vulnerable to pressure anymore? And how many more Ukrainian civilians will die until he is?",13,3.6545811336857765,3.1914524240847046,0.4631287096010719,16
2022-04-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/europe/bucha-ukraine-russian-occupation-reality-intl-cmd/index.html,"Bodies tied up, shot and left to rot in Bucha hint at gruesome reality of Russia's occupation in Ukraine","The Russian column of tanks and armored personnel carriers sped along a residential street in Bucha, a tree-lined suburb of the capital Kyiv. That was February 27th. A short time later, that same line of vehicles lay in ruins, the wreckage smoldering, after being ambushed by Ukrainian forces. There was no sign of the column's soldiers. In a video showing the destruction, a man could be heard muttering: ""I wish you all to burn in hell."" But that Ukrainian victory was to be short-lived; a month-long occupation of Bucha by Russian forces followed. The suburb's name has this week become a byword for war crimes, after accounts of summary executions, brutality and indiscriminate shelling emerged in the wake of Russia's hasty retreat, as the Kremlin shifts its focus away from the Ukrainian capital to the country's east. In recent days, Moscow has claimed -- without evidence -- that the atrocities in Bucha were staged -- calling it ""fake,"" and part of a ""planned media campaign."" But witnesses who spoke to CNN said the carnage in the town began weeks ago. And the devastation there bears similarities to Russia's playbook in other towns and cities in Ukraine, where officials say civilian infrastructure has come under attack -- with power supplies knocked out, water cut off and communications towers damaged -- making it harder for local residents to hold out against Russian troops. But Ukraine has not surrendered. There have also been reports of looting, disappearances, and evidence of the indiscriminate killings of civilians since the war began. Horrors on the road Bucha -- once a magnet for young families due to its affordable homes, green spaces, and good schools -- and other areas nearby, turned into a living nightmare in March as Russian troops stormed the region. Residents there share difficult to verify stories of looted homes, senseless murders and failed escapes via Kyiv's Zhytomyr highway -- now a graveyard for wrecked tanks and burned-out cars. In Bucha, pitch-roofed homes crumbled under the force of Russian artillery strikes. Residents say they had no choice but to turn their vegetable patches and front yards into makeshift graves, since the presence of Russian forces made it impossible to reach the morgue or local cemetery. Anna Bilous, 48, had lived in Bucha for eight years before the Russian troops arrived. She sheltered in her home with her husband and two sons, but around March 4, when the electricity cut out and the pipes ran dry, it became clear they had to leave, she told CNN. They decided that Bilous and her two sons would flee on foot, heading for the nearby suburb of Irpin on March 9, while her husband stayed behind to care for the family's elderly neighbors. The trio traveled on side roads to avoid the Russian soldiers, but when they turned onto Yablunska Street, the family was stunned to find dead bodies scattered across the road -- including one lifeless man collapsed under a bicycle. Bilous believes the man's body remained there for close to a month, until he and some 20 other civilians were photographed for the world to see this past weekend. Bucha's mayor has described their deaths as an execution. Bilous' account and satellite images captured on March 18, shared by Maxar Technologies, show that the bodies had lain in the street for weeks, since the town was under Russian control -- Russia held Bucha until March 31. On Tuesday, the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov continued to deny the accusations of brutal civilian killings in Bucha, saying the claims are not only ""groundless, but are a well-staged tragic show"" and ""a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army."" Reports of executions About a mile away, at a sanatorium in Vokzal'na Street on Monday, Ukrainian officials ushered journalists into a cold basement where the contorted and bloodied bodies of five men lay in an advanced state of decay. Some of those in this dimly-lit space had been kneecapped. Others, their arms bound behind their backs, had been shot multiple times. Bullet casings littered the ground. Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the Ukrainian interior minister, said it was a cruel display of torture and execution by Russian soldiers. CNN cannot independently verify his claim. The men were killed sometime in the last three weeks, officials say. Their bodies are as yet unidentified, since no personal documents have been found. In a statement, the Russian Ministry of Defense has denied anyone was harmed. ""Taking into account that the troops left the city on March 30, where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake."" Officials say Russian forces bedded down in the sanatorium around the second week of March. Several foxholes, trenches, and positions for armored vehicles remain visible around the site; leftover Russian rations have been abandoned nearby. Soldiers have daubed the exterior walls of the facility with the letter ""V,"" a symbol used by Russia's Eastern Military District, and used synonymously with the letter ""Z,"" as an emblem for Russia's ""special military operation."" The gruesome scene proved too much for Vladislav Minchenko, who vomited after volunteering to help remove the bodies from the basement on Monday. ""This is not what we learned in school,"" said Minchenko, 44, who worked as a painter before the war. Holding up his hands, Minchenko told CNN the number of dead bodies he had dealt with since the start of the conflict numbered in the ""hundreds -- not dozens -- hundreds."" Hasty burials in mass grave Shelling, live fire, and trigger-happy Russian soldiers made it too dangerous for those injured in the assault on Bucha to seek treatment at the local hospital in the center of town, according to residents. The local morgue in Bucha ran out of space as deaths mounted in March; to deal with all the bodies, a tractor was brought in to dig a mass grave in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, its abbot, Andriy Galavin told CNN. ""There were too many dead people, and there was no way to properly bury them because getting to the cemetery was simply unrealistic because of the shelling,"" Galavin said. There was also a lack of resources, such as coffins, due to the main bridge connecting Bucha to Irpin being blown up at the start of the war, Galavin said. As of this weekend, Kyiv Regional Police and residents believed the remains of at least 150 people had been laid to rest in the grave, but the mayor of Bucha said the death toll could be as high as 300. CNN could not independently verify those claims. Galavin returned to Bucha last week once the town was liberated; he said the plan was to exhume the bodies, identify them via DNA analysis and hopefully provide some solace to relatives still searching for missing loved ones. Tip of the iceberg The devastation wrought in Bucha is just the tip of the iceberg, Ukrainian President Zelensky warned on Monday. ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago,"" President Zelensky said. ""The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this."" One grisly example of the callous indifference for human life was found in Motyzhyn, a village around 20 miles south of Bucha. The local mayor, Olga Sukhenko, was discovered half-buried in a ditch alongside members of her family. Ukrainian officials said Saturday that she was killed after being captured by Russian forces. And, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says that 11 local mayors are being held by the Russians, which CNN cannot verify. ""Unfortunately, so far, we have not been able to get in touch or to free any other city mayors and we don't even know, we think that some of them were killed,"" she told CNN, promising that the perpetrators would pay for their crimes against Ukraine. ""We will find them and kill them, and we will punish everyone who killed our city mayors, our journalists, our priests, our activists."" As Ukrainian officials race to clear mines and booby traps left by retreating Russian troops, they fear civilian casualties may be much higher in Borodyanka, 14 miles west of Bucha. Oksana Kostychenko and her husband Oleksandr returned home to Borodyanka over the weekend after fleeing the area on February 27. They discovered that their house had been trashed and looted by Russian soldiers. The couple also found a dead man in their backyard. His arms were tied behind his back, and his trousers had been pulled down. ""Alcohol is everywhere. Empty bottles in the hallway, under things,"" Oksana said. ""They smoked a lot, put out cigarettes on the table... They lived here as they wished."" Anna Bilous and her sons made it out of Bucha on March 10. But the fate of the dead man they saw lying beneath a bicycle as they fled still haunts her. ""I feel like me and my sons could be in the same place as the man who died,"" she said. ""I feel the pain and sadness of all these lost people.""",17,3.1798041029232915,1.4891636760228002,1.6906404269004913,15
2022-04-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/world/zelensky-ukraine-united-nations-speech-intl/index.html,Ukraine's Zelensky questions UN Security Council's mandate in speech on alleged Russian atrocities,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of indiscriminately killing civilians ""just for their pleasure"" in an emotionally-charged address to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, before questioning the very mandate of the Security Council itself. Zelensky's speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend. On Tuesday, he related the aftermath of Russia's retreat from the town in horrifying detail, describing entire families killed, people with their throats slashed, and women raped and killed in front of their children. Zelensky said Russia's actions were no different from those of a terror group, except that Russia is a permanent member of the UNSC. The Ukrainian leader then criticized the body, asking representatives point blank: ""Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It is not there, though there is a Security Council."" Zelensky added: ""It is obvious that the key institution of the world designed to combat aggression and ensure peace cannot work effectively. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you of Article 1, Chapter 1 of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? Its purpose is to maintain and make sure that peace is adhered to. And now the UN charter is violated literally starting with Article 1. And so what is the point of all other Articles?"" he asked. At least 1,480 civilians have been killed and at least 2,195 have been injured in Ukraine between the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 and April 4, a UN official said at the meeting, citing updated numbers from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The latest figures on the number of Ukrainian civilians in the conflict had ""more than doubled"" since the last briefing to the UNSC on March 17. In Bucha, bodies strewn across the streets and in basements were found by human rights groups and documented by independent journalists. Satellite images suggest some bodies had been there since at least March 18. In his damning speech, Zelensky said there was ""not a single crime"" that the Russians ""would not commit,"" alleging that Russian troops had ""searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country."" ""They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone ... They killed entire families, adults and children and they tried to burn the bodies,"" Zelensky said. ""I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased every single day and in the memory of the civilians who died, who were shot and killed in the back of their head after being tortured,"" he told the UNSC. ""Some of them were shot on the streets. Others were thrown into wells, so they died there suffering. They were killed in their apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road, just for their pleasure,"" he continued. ""Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them."" Zelensky also warned that the horrors found in Bucha would be replicated in other cities across Ukraine. Demanding accountability, he called for any Russians who have given ""criminal orders"" and ""carried out them by killing our people"" to be brought before a tribunal, similar to the Nuremberg trials that occurred after World War II when Nazis were put on trial. UN: Civilians were targeted Separately, the United Nations on Tuesday said that the shocking images from Bucha showed ""all the signs"" that civilians were ""directly targeted and directly killed."" In a virtual press briefing, OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell said the reports emerging from Bucha and other areas were ""very disturbing developments."" She specifically referenced the ""disturbing"" images of people with their hands tied behind their back and of partially naked women whose bodies have been burnt as further evidence suggesting the direct targeting of individuals. ""We have been talking about war crimes in the context of shelling, bombardment, and artillery attacks. Now they need to be investigated. But you could argue there was a military context, for example, to a building being hit. It's hard to see what was the military context of an individual lying in the street with a bullet to the head or having their bodies burned,"" Throssell continued. As the OHCHR is trying to currently gain access to Bucha, she didn't have ""exact information"" to share regarding the situation on the ground. Throssell also paid tribute to the ""crucial role"" that journalists are playing in documenting these scenes, mentioning the ""multiple teams"" involved in ""reporting, analyzing, and sending video footage."" Russia's response Russia has repeatedly denied the alleged atrocities, despite increasing evidence suggesting otherwise. Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations responded to Zelensky's remarks, calling the accusations against the Russian military ""ungrounded."" ""We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military, which are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses,"" Nebenzia said in translated remarks. The ambassador recalled Zelensky's election to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019, stating that hopes that Zelensky would end the fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine ""failed to materialize."" Nebenzia also repeated past claims that ""a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military"" continue to proliferate. Addressing Zelensky directly, Nebenzia concluded his remarks by claiming Russia ""came to ... Ukraine"" to bring peace, not to ""conquer lands."" Nebenzia's words echoed those of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier Tuesday, who called the allegations not only ""groundless, but ... a well-staged tragic show"" and ""a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army.""",13,1.0634736992830613,4.413423510736422,-3.3499498114533606,5
2022-04-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/world/nasa-astronaut-mark-vande-hei-iss-scn/index.html,"Russian cosmonauts 'blindsided' by controversy over arriving at ISS in yellow spacesuits, NASA astronaut says","The three Russian astronauts who boarded the International Space Station last month in spacesuits that echoed the colors of Ukraine's flag were paying tribute to their university and not protesting Russia's invasion, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei said Tuesday. The yellow and blue spacesuits surprised many observers, who assumed the Russians were showing support for Ukraine. However, the three cosmonauts are all graduates of Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which has yellow and blue in its emblem. Vande Hei said cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov were caught off guard by the controversy over their spacesuits. ""All three of them happened to be associated with the same university, and I think they were kind of blindsided by it,"" he said at a press conference. Vande Hei said he didn't shy away from discussing the war with his ISS crewmates. ""They weren't very long discussions, but I did ask them how they were feeling and sometimes asked pointed questions, but our focus was on our mission together."" Vande Hei landed in Kazakhstan in a Russian Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft on March 30 after a record-breaking 355 days spent in space. He traveled back from the space station with cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov. Geopolitical tensions His return from the ISS was highly anticipated and drew unprecedented attention because of mounting geopolitical tensions fueled by Russian space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin, who made several fiery social media posts directed at the United States. This included Rogozin retweeting a partially animated video that appeared to threaten that Russian astronauts would abandon Vande Hei in space. Rogozin also engaged in a Twitter spat with retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who held the record for the longest stint in space by a US astronaut until Vande Hei surpassed him. Vande Hei said he heard about the tweets from his wife. ""I never perceived those tweets as anything to take seriously,"" he said, adding he saw the tweets as aimed at a ""different audience"" other than him. ""I just didn't spend a lot of emotional energy paying attention to it. I heard about it. I kind of laughed it off and moved on,"" he said. On Saturday, Rogozin suggested in a series of tweets that Russia might end cooperation with the ISS due to international sanctions on Moscow and said Russia would prepare ""concrete proposals to our country's leadership"" on the possibility of ending cooperation at the ISS with the space agencies of the US, Canada, the European Union and Japan. NASA said, ""the professional relationship between our international partners, astronauts and cosmonauts continues for the safety and mission of all on board the ISS."" Other parts of Russia's space program have been affected by the war in Ukraine. The country's Mars rover project with the European Space Agency is on hold. Russian crewmates 'dear friends' Vande Hei declined to reveal how the Russians on board felt about the invasion of Ukraine. ""Those are things that I would prefer that they get to share directly rather than me sharing how they feel about it,"" he said. He said the invasion itself was ""heartbreaking, very sad"" and he felt ""powerless"" learning about it while living in space. Vande Hei said it didn't change his feelings about his Russian crewmates. ""They were, are, and will continue to be very dear friends of mine. We supported each other throughout everything. And I never had any concerns about my ability to continue to work with them."" Upon landing after his record-breaking mission, Vande Hei said he was able to walk after about eight hours, though he said he was wobbly. He said he was also happy to eat some guacamole for the first time in a year and was shocked at how normal it felt to be back on Earth after so long in space. ""It's a little disappointing how normal it feels.""",3,6.336064974323728,6.533817603130217,-0.19775262880648903,11
2022-04-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/politics/bucha-putin-war-crimes-what-matters/index.html,Ukraine's dilemma: How to negotiate with someone who could be a war criminal,"When the war criminal is a world leader, how do you negotiate with him? The mounting evidence of Russian atrocities -- over the weekend, it was in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv -- led US President Joe Biden to say Monday that Vladimir Putin must be put on trial. That truth is complicated by the hard fact that this war is most likely to end through negotiations with Putin, whose hold on power in Russia seems absolute. Making the case against Putin We have written here before about the difficulty in international law of finding accountability for someone like Putin, the leader of a nuclear-armed, gas-producing nation. That was before horrible pictures showing dead civilians left on a street in Bucha. RELATED: CNN's Nathan Hodge looks at the well-documented brutality of the Russian military. Biden had previously said he felt Putin was a war criminal, and the reports from Bucha led him to say a methodical case must be built to put the Russian leader on trial. ""We have to get all the details so this can be an actual -- have a war crime trial,"" Biden told reporters in Washington. ""This guy is brutal and what's happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone's seen it."" Putin is also the key to ending violence When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toured the wreckage in Bucha, he noted the obvious. ""It's very difficult to negotiate when you see what they have done here,"" Zelensky said. From CNN's report: Wearing a flak jacket and surrounded by security, he talked about ""key leaders of leading countries who made the decisions whether Ukraine should be a NATO member."" ""I think they should come here and see how these games, how this flirting with the Russian federation ends,"" he said. At some point, Zelensky will likely have to negotiate directly with Putin for the war to end. Earlier in the weekend, Ukrainian negotiators had said they were approaching the point where ""direct consultations"" between the two might be possible. Creating a 'mechanism for justice' In separate remarks Sunday, Zelensky said he is also looking for a new ""mechanism of justice"" to investigate crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukrainian territory. ""This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said. Officials with the European Union, which Ukraine also wants to join, have said they have established a joint investigation team with Ukraine to probe alleged Russian war crimes. All of this is alongside efforts by the International Criminal Court, which has launched its own investigation into Russia's activities in Ukraine. Putin's protection Putin's power in Russia seems, for now, to be strong, which makes it nearly impossible to put him on trial, as Biden suggests, according to Kenneth Rodman, a political scientist at Colby College who has studied war crimes and the ICC. In every previous instance, ""to prosecute someone you actually have to defeat them or they have to be overthrown in some kind of coup or political process,"" he told me in a phone conversation. That was the case with both Nazi and Japanese leaders after World War II, and with the Bosnian, Serbian and Rwandan leaders of the 1990s. ""If they haven't been defeated, you have to negotiate with them,"" Rodman said. Getting past immunity for world leaders The agreement that created the International Criminal Court -- the Rome Statute -- not only prohibits trials in absentia but also seems to immunize leaders who are in power from prosecution, according to Rodman. I asked a former ICC official, James Goldston, who is now executive director of the Open Society Justice Initiative, if the world has the apparatus to prosecute someone like Putin. He agreed with Rodman that heads of state are generally granted immunity from prosecution. But Goldston sent along a passage from the Rome Statute -- it ""shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular, official capacity as a Head of State or Government"" -- and said the International Criminal Court could use it to justify a case against Putin. There are also proposals to set up a special international body focused specifically on aggression in Ukraine, Goldston said. Multiple ideas have been suggested: A state could try to hold its own prosecution of Putin under the international legal theory of ""universal jurisdiction."" Germany did this when it tried a former member of the Syrian regime. Or the United Nations could set up a special tribunal specifically to look at Russia's and Putin's actions. Moving up the chain of command For now, any war crimes effort is likely to start at lower levels, with Russians on the ground in Ukraine. Here's a passage from Goldston's email to me: There are many persons who are responsible for the crimes now being committed in Ukraine. Often international criminal investigations begin with the ""crime base"" -- authenticated images, witness testimonies and other evidence concerning killings, torture, rape or other prohibited offenses which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity -- and proceed upward along a chain of military or political authority to demonstrate the culpability of those who ordered, or who knew of but failed to prevent/punish, the commission of such crimes. Negotiating with 'bloody hands' Accountability for Russians' alleged actions in Ukraine is one thing -- and stopping the war right now is another. ""The idea is you want to hold people accountable and end the culture of impunity that allows for this kind of behavior,"" said Rodman. ""On the other hand, ending civil conflicts requires negotiating with people with bloody hands,"" Rodman told me, pointing to negotiations the US and others undertook with the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in 1995 or negotiations between the African National Congress and the apartheid regime. ""It's a basic dilemma in international relations."" Here's a photo of Bill Clinton celebrating the Dayton Peace Agreement behind Milosevic. Milosevic later died in jail while awaiting trial as a war criminal, but only after he lost elections in 2000 and fell from power in Serbia and Yugoslavia. Goldston, the former war crimes prosecutor, said the need for accountability cannot be lost. ""The lessons of past conflicts overwhelmingly suggest that no peace will be sustainable if founded on impunity for those most criminally responsible,"" he said.",13,4.9789367921679455,3.54941775194262,1.4295190402253253,19
2022-04-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/europe/russia-military-culture-brutality-intl/index.html,"In Russia's military, a culture of brutality runs deep","The grotesque pictures emerging from the Kyiv suburb of Bucha are some of the strongest evidence yet of apparent war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine: Dead civilians on the street, some with hands bound and shot execution-style, others apparently mowed down at random. For anyone who has followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's way of war, it's a depressingly familiar pattern. Russia's military has a culture of brutality and scorn for the laws of armed conflict that has been extensively documented in the past. ""The history of Russia's military interventions -- be it in Ukraine or Syria, or its military campaign at home in Chechnya -- is tainted with blatant disregard for international humanitarian law,"" said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International's Secretary General. ""The Russian military repeatedly flouted the laws of war by failing to protect civilians and even attacking them directly. Russian forces have launched indiscriminate attacks, used banned weapons and sometimes apparently deliberately targeted civilians and civilian objects -- a war crime."" That statement, made less than a month before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has proven sadly prophetic. In the opening weeks of the war, the international community reacted with horror as Ukrainian cities came under relentless Russian bombardment. Protected civilian infrastructure was hit, much as Russian aircraft once targeted Syrian schools and hospitals. But the scenes unfolding in places like Bucha suggest an intimate kind of violence, something reminiscent of Russia's war in Chechnya. During the second Chechen war -- which coincided with Putin's rise to power -- allegations also surfaced of widespread human-rights abuse by Russian troops. In 2000, to cite just one well-known incident, investigators with Human Rights Watch documented the summary execution of at least 60 civilians in two suburbs of Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. Locals unearthed mass graves in Chechnya; international officials made fact-finding trips to the region and made concerned statements about the reports of abuse and extrajudicial killings. Those statements did not stop Russia's military from grinding ahead with its ruthless pacification campaign. Similar evidence of summary executions abounds in towns such as Bucha. A CNN team visited the basement of one building and saw the bodies of five men before they were removed by a Ukrainian team. An adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, told CNN that the five men had been tortured and executed by Russian soldiers. CNN cannot independently verify Gerashchenko's claims. But equally troubling is the alleged treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian forces. The Ukrainian parliament's human rights ombudsman, Liudmyla Denisova, said Monday that Russia's treatment of prisoners of war violates the Geneva Conventions, laying out a theoretical case for potential war crimes prosecutions. In a Facebook post on Monday, Denisova said that released Ukrainian soldiers have ""told of the inhumane treatment of them by the Russian side: they were kept in a field, in a pit, in a garage. Periodically, one was taken out: beaten with rifle butts, shots fired next to their ear, intimidated."" CNN cannot independently verify Denisova's claims. Igor Zhdanov, a correspondent for the Russian state propaganda outlet RT, posted videos on March 22 depicting Ukrainian prisoners of war being processed for ""filtration"" -- Zhdanov's choice of word -- after they were captured. The videos show masked Russians searching their captives for tattoos or insignia, which would supposedly show affiliation with nationalists or ""neo-Nazi"" groups that the Russians have cast as their main enemy in Ukraine. Zhdanov said in his post that Ukrainian POWs were being treated humanely. But his choice of words was ominous. During the war in Chechnya, Russian forces notoriously used so-called ""filtration camps"" used to separate civilians from rebel fighters. Legendary Russian investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya gathered testimony from Chechen civilians detained in filtration centers, where detainees said they were held in pits and subjected to electric shock, beatings and ruthless interrogation. Russian forces have also targeted local Ukrainian mayors for detention -- and in at least one case, Ukrainian officials say, an extrajudicial killing. ""At the moment, 11 local mayors from Kyiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Donetsk regions are in Russian captivity,"" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a message posted on social media Sunday. She said the Ukrainian government learnt Saturday that Olga Sukhenko, the mayor of Motyzhyn, a village in the Kyiv region, was killed in the custody of Russian forces. Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the southern city of Melitopol -- who was detained by Russian forces but subsequently freed as part of a prisoner exchange -- said Russian forces occupying his city were appropriating local businesses, saying that the ""situation is difficult, because Russian soldiers have declared themselves as authorities but of course, they don't care about people and their problems, they only care about taking the money from the businessmen, [and seizing] their businesses."" Long before the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military had a reputation for a culture of cruelty. Russia has a hybrid manpower system of contract soldiers and conscripts. Although the Russian government claims to have made strides in professionalizing its forces, the country's military still has a brutal hazing system known as dedovshchina, a notorious tradition that encourages senior conscripts to beat, brutalize or even rape younger conscripts. Putin recently announced a decree on spring conscription, fixing a target for 134,500 individuals to be called up into the Russian armed forces. The Russian President originally claimed that Russian conscripts would not take part in what Russia has euphemistically dubbed the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. But the Russian Ministry of Defense subsequently acknowledged that draftees were fighting in Ukraine, and Ukrainian forces claim to have taken a considerable number of Russian conscripts prisoner. Ukrainian investigators are already launching criminal probes of alleged crimes by Russian forces as more areas are freed from Russian control -- particularly around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. It will be days, or perhaps weeks, before we get a fuller picture of what happened in Bucha. But if the past is any guide, there is little hope that Russian perpetrators would be brought to justice.",13,3.452501683479424,2.3193684425225096,1.1331332409569144,5

That's how Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the shocking images of at least 20 civilian men's bodies strewn across the street in Bucha, northwest of the capital of Kyiv, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities, including the horrific images of dead civilians captured by Agence France-Presse, are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital. ""The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,"" Zelensky said Sunday on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" when asked if Russia is carrying out genocide. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths. Russia responds. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the extensive footage of dead bodies in Bucha was ""fake,"" saying ""not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions,"" during Russia's occupation of Bucha. ""In the settlements of the Kiev region, Russian military personnel delivered and issued 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians,"" it said in a statement. A separate statement claimed the footage was staged. The Russian government has consistently responded to allegations of civilian casualties inflicted by Russian forces with blanket denials. Human Rights Watch documents alleged crimes. Rape, summary executions and unlawful violence are some of the war crimes allegedly perpetrated by Russian forces against civilians in the occupied areas of the Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions of Ukraine, according to Human Rights Watch, an independent rights group. HRW said in a statement Sunday that it has documented allegations of war crimes, which ""include a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022."" CNN has not independently verified the details of those reports and has requested comment from the Russian Ministry of Defense regarding the allegations. Urgent appeal at the Grammys. In a taped message shown at the Grammy Awards later Sunday, Zelensky made an urgent plea for support with a speech that began: ""The war. What's more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people."" ""Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos,"" he said at one point. ""They sing to the wounded. In hospitals."" Zelensky implored those listening to ""Tell the truth about war. On your social networks. On TV. Support us in any way you can. Any. But not silence."" CNN team observes a mass grave site. A mass grave has been discovered in the town of Bucha, CNN found. CNN saw at least a dozen bodies in body bags piled inside the grave. Some were already partially covered. Bodies were first buried in the grave, on the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, in the first days of the war, residents told CNN. Around 150 people, mostly civilians killed in the fighting around the town, are buried there, residents said. The mayor of Bucha said in public remarks on Saturday that there could be up to 300 victims buried on site. CNN was unable to independently verify those numbers or the identities and nationalities of those buried in the grave. 'A punch to the gut.' US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the State Department would help document any atrocities the Russian military committed against Ukrainian civilians. ""You can't help but see these images as a punch to the gut,"" Blinken told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" Sunday, responding to the reports from Bucha. Last month, the State Department formally accused Russian forces of war crimes in Ukraine. Asked Sunday whether Russian troops were committing genocide, Blinken didn't go as far as Zelensky. ""We will look hard and document everything that we see, put it all together, make sure that the relevant institutions and organizations that are looking at this, including the State Department, have everything they need to assess exactly what took place in Ukraine, who's responsible and what it amounts to,"" he said. New investigation coming? The top UN official said an ""independent investigation"" into the civilians killed in Bucha is ""essential"" to ensure ""effective accountability."" ""I am deeply shocked by the images of civilians killed in Bucha, Ukraine,"" UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement Sunday. More sanctions could be on the way. State Department spokesperson Ned Price, meanwhile, hinted at additional US action against Russia coming ""very soon"" when asked about Zelensky's request for greater G7 sanctions in response to the latest alleged atrocities in Bucha. ""When it comes to our sanctions, we've always said that we will continue applying pressure on President Putin, on the Kremlin, on all of those around him including oligarchs and cronies who are empowering this war of choice against Ukraine, until and unless the Kremlin deescalates, until and unless the violence diminishes, and until and unless these kinds of atrocities come to an end. So I suspect you will very soon see additional pressure applied,"" Price told MSNBC on Sunday. 'Not enough.' In a video address later on Sunday, in which he called for an end of Russian ""war crimes,"" Zelensky said of stronger sanctions against Russia: ""I'm sure that's not enough."" ""More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land,"" he added. Expect the attacks to continue. This is not a ""real withdrawal of Russian forces,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said, warning that attacks in Ukraine will continue. ""What we see is not a real withdrawal. But we see that Russia is repositioning its troops and they are taking some of them back to rearm them, to reinforce them, to resupply them. We should not in a way be too optimistic because the attacks will continue,"" Stoltenberg told CNN Sunday.

2022-04-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/politics/state-department-cyber-bureau/index.html,State Department launches cyberbureau amid concerns over Russia and China's digital authoritarianism,"The State Department's new cybersecurity bureau formally launched on Monday in an effort to make digital rights issues an intrinsic part of US foreign policy at a time when Russia and China are increasingly trying to put their own authoritarian stamp on the internet. The move essentially reshapes and greatly expands a bureaucratic structure, with a high-ranking cyber diplomat, that the Trump administration had effectively downgraded in the pursuit of cutting red tape. The new bureau is aimed at putting more diplomatic personnel and expertise toward State Department priorities such as shaping norms of responsible government behavior in cyberspace and helping US allies bolster their own cybersecurity programs. ""As what's happening in Ukraine and Russia illustrates, we're in a contest over the rules, infrastructure, and standards that will define our digital future,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in prepared remarks describing the role of the new Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy. ""Democracies must answer together the question of whether universal rights and democratic values will be at the center of our digital lives -- and whether digital technologies deliver real benefits in people's lives,"" Blinken said. Though US diplomats have continued to pursue cyber issues on a number of fronts, critics said then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's 2017 move to effectively downgrade the stature of the cybersecurity office within the department signaled to the world American disinterest in cyberspace. Then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo proposed a new cybersecurity bureau in the waning days of the Trump administration, but the initiative never got off the ground. Cybersecurity issues have only gotten more pressing in the years since. The iPhones of about a dozen State Department employees serving in Africa were hacked with spyware developed by Israeli technology firm NSO Group, CNN reported in December. The Biden administration has pledged to crack down on the use of such spyware, saying it has been used to violate human rights around the world. The new cyberbureau adds more personnel across multiple cyber-related issues, such as digital freedom and cybersecurity technologies, than existed under previous cybersecurity offices at the State Department. State Department officials said Monday that they expect to have 100 personnel staff the bureau by the end of the year. ""It's an evolution of the centrality of these issues for foreign policy to move from an office that was small into an institutionalized bureau within the department,"" a State Department official told CNN. Jennifer Bachus, a career diplomat, will lead the new bureau on an interim basis until the Biden administration nominates a Senate-confirmed ""ambassador-at-large"" to take the job, according to the State Department. ""I will work hard to make sure the bureau is appropriately structured and staffed for its mission: to elevate cyber and digital diplomacy globally, and to prioritize this work here in Washington and at our embassies and consulates,"" Bachus, who just returned from a diplomatic tour in the Czech Republic, told State Department colleagues on Monday. For at least the first year of its existence, the bureau will report directly to the deputy secretary of State. ""We want to make sure that it has priority attention from the senior most officials in this building,"" a State Department spokesperson said in an interview. Christopher Painter, who was the top cyber diplomat at the State Department until 2017, said the reinstatement of a top cybersecurity bureau could give the department more clout in interagency discussions about high-profile cyber issues. ""Where we talk about everything from economic tools that Treasury may be using to cyber tools that DOD [Department of Defense] may be using, it's important to have that diplomatic voice in there,"" Painter told CNN.

2022-04-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/europe/russia-ukraine-catch-up-intl/index.html,Five important things that happened in Ukraine over the weekend,"It's been 39 days since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, but the true horrors of the war are only just becoming clear, as shocking images of carnage in the town of Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, show civilian bodies littering a street. Here are five important developments from this weekend. Mass graves and murdered civilians Nightmarish scenes of mass graves and murdered civilians are being revealed following the pullback of Russian troops from the greater Kyiv area. In Bucha, northwest of the capital, images show civilian bodies strewn across a road following the Russian withdrawal. CNN reporters observed a mass grave in the town, with the mayor saying up to 300 victims may be buried there. Though the footage left many lost for words, Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, reacted to the images. ""This is genocide,"" Zelensky said on Sunday. ""The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,"" he continued. The scenes have drawn international outrage, with Western leaders calling for war crimes investigations and increasing sanctions on Russia. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the extensive footage was ""fake,"" saying ""not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions"" during Russia's occupation of Bucha. US State Department spokesman Ned Price hinted at additional US action against Russia coming ""very soon"" when asked about Zelensky's request for greater G7 sanctions in response to the latest atrocities. HRW documents allege war crimes by Russian forces Rape, summary executions and unlawful violence are some of the war crimes allegedly perpetrated by Russian forces against civilians in the occupied areas of Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv regions of Ukraine, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The independent rights group said in a statement Sunday that it has documented allegations of war crimes, which ""include a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022."" ""Soldiers were also implicated in looting civilian property, including food, clothing and firewood. Those who carried out these abuses are responsible for war crimes,"" it added. CNN has not independently verified the details of those reports, and has requested comment from the Russian Ministry of Defense regarding the allegations. ""The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,"" Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe and Central Asia director, said in the statement. ""Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces' custody should be investigated as war crimes."" Odesa under attack The southern coastal city of Odesa came under attack Sunday, with a local official saying a Russian missile strike had hit ""critical infrastructure."" A fuel depot in the city was still burning Monday morning, according to a CNN team on the scene, with one witness telling CNN they heard six explosions at the fuel depot before sunrise. The coastal city has been a place of relative calm during the Russian invasion and a haven for displaced Ukrainians from areas that have seen the worst fighting. But Odesa has been bracing for a Russian attack for weeks, with the city center full of anti-tank barricades. ""Odesa was attacked from the air. Some of the missiles were downed by our air defense system. In some districts fire has broken out,"" the Odesa City Council posted on its official Telegram account. Russia ramps up attacks in eastern Ukraine In the light of fierce Ukrainian resistance, US intelligence suggests Russia has revised its invasion strategy to focus on taking control of the Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine, with a target date of early May. Serhiy Haidai, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said Monday that the Russian military had been gathering a ""significant accumulation of troops and military equipment"" in the region, in apparent preparation for an offensive push. ""Yes, I can confirm, that there is a significant accumulation of troops and military equipment that is getting prepared for the major breakthrough (in Luhansk region),"" he said, speaking on national television. ""There was an attempt of a breakthrough in Rubizhne this night, our defenders repelled an attack. We are holding out, but we do see there's a major accumulation of troops."" Leaders in the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics previously announced a ""full mobilization"" in the territories under their control. Haidai said the mobilization was underway, but added that the new recruits were inexperienced and were ""being used as cannon fodder."" The Russian military has said it is pulling back its forces from around Kyiv and the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv to concentrate efforts in the Donbas region. Two Russia-friendly European leaders set to win re-election Hungary's authoritarian leader and longtime Russian ally, Viktor Orban, declared victory in the country's parliamentary elections, clinching a fourth consecutive term in power. Orban's Fidesz party had a commanding lead with 71% of the votes counted, the national elections board said on Sunday evening. The election campaign was dominated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which put Orban's lengthy association with Russian President Vladimir Putin under scrutiny. In his victory speech, Orban called Zelensky one of the ""opponents"" he had to overcome during the campaign. Hungary is heavily reliant on Russian energy and Orban has dodged opportunities to condemn Putin's assault on its neighboring state, complicating efforts by the European Union (EU) to present a united front against him. Meanwhile, Serbia's incumbent President, Aleksandar Vucic, is set to win Sunday's presidential election with 59.8% of the votes, according to a projection by pollsters Ipsos and CeSID, Reuters reports. The projection is based on a sample of the partial polling station count. Vucic ran for a second five-year term on a promise of peace and stability just as Russia invaded Ukraine. This has put Serbia under pressure from the West to choose between its traditional ties with Moscow and aspirations to join the EU. Vucic acknowledged conflict in Ukraine affected the campaign and said Serbia has no plans to deviate from its balancing game between the EU membership bid and close ties with Russia and China, a major investor. ""We will maintain policy that is important for the Europeans, Russians and Americans, and that is ... military neutrality,"" Reuters reported Vucic as saying. ""Serbia will try to preserve friendly and partnership relations in many areas with the Russian Federation,"" he added. Serbia is almost entirely dependent on Russian gas, and its army maintains ties with Russia's military. Although Serbia backed two UN resolutions condemning the invasion of Ukraine, it refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, according to Reuters.",13,5.950332380660977,2.842434514279567,3.10789786638141,19
2022-04-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/europe/bucha-ukraine-civilian-deaths-intl/index.html,Bodies of 'executed people' strewn across street in Bucha as Ukraine accuses Russia of war crimes,"The lifeless bodies of at least 20 civilian men line a single street in the town of Bucha near the Ukrainian capital. Some lie face down on the pavement while others are collapsed on their backs, mouths open in a tragic testament to the horrors of Russian occupation. The hands of one man are tied behind his back with a piece of white cloth. Another man lies alone, tangled up in a bicycle by a grassy bank. A third man lies in the middle of the road, near the charred remains of a burned-out car. The shocking images of the carnage in Bucha were captured by Agence France-Presse on Saturday, the same day Ukraine declared the town liberated from Russian troops. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital. The town of Bucha has endured five weeks of near-constant firefights. Now officials and human rights groups are blaming the civilian deaths on the departed Russian forces. ""Corpses of executed people still line the Yabluska street in Bucha. Their hands are tied behind their backs with white 'civilian' rags, they were shot in the back of their heads. So you can imagine what kind of lawlessness they perpetrated here,"" Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk told Reuters on Saturday. In a video address Sunday after the reports out of Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for an end of Russian ""war crimes."" ""The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth,"" he said. Zelensky called on Russian leaders to be held accountable for the actions of the nation's military. ""I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image,"" Zelensky said. The alleged atrocities in Bucha have drawn international outrage, with Western leaders, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, calling for war crimes investigations and increasing sanctions on Russia. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths. In his address, Zelensky announced a ""mechanism of justice"" would be established to investigate crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukrainian territory. The mechanism would be supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Prosecutor General's Office, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other government branches, he said. ""This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said. Zelensky said he will provide more information on the state of Ukrainian territory that was occupied by Russian forces. ""All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the (United Nations) Security Council on Tuesday,"" he said. He also noted that efforts are underway to restore electricity and water to Bucha, as well as reestablishing medical institutions and infrastructure. Zelensky once again invoked the need for stronger sanctions against Russia. ""There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land,"" he said. Asked during an appearance earlier Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" if Russia was carrying out genocide in his country, Zelensky said: ""Indeed. This is genocide."" ""The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,"" he said. The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed the extensive footage of Bucha was ""fake,"" saying ""not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions"" during Russia's occupation of the city. ""In the settlements of the Kiev region, Russian military personnel delivered and issued 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians,"" it said in a statement. A separate statement claimed the footage was staged. ""Stories about Bucha appeared in several foreign media outlets at once, which looks like a planned media campaign,"" the statement said. ""Taking into account that the troops left the city on March 30, where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake."" The Russian government has consistently responded to allegations of civilian casualties inflicted by Russian forces with blanket denials. After the Russian air force bombed a maternity hospital on March 9, Russian officials attempted to cast doubt on widespread media reports, with one Russian diplomat accusing a victim of the bombing -- a woman who escaped from the bombing, bloodied and still pregnant -- of being an actor and not a real victim. Mass grave The toll of the Russian invasion was apparent at a mass grave in Bucha. People cried as they attempted to locate the bodies of lost loved ones at a grave located in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints on Sunday, according to a CNN team at the scene. Bucha residents told CNN that bodies were first buried in the grave in the first few days of the war. They believe 150 people are buried in the site, many of whom were civilians killed in the fighting around Bucha. CNN saw at least a dozen bodies in body bags piled inside the grave. Some were already partially covered. The mayor of Bucha said in public remarks Saturday that up to 300 victims could be buried at the site. CNN was unable to independently verify those numbers or the identities and nationalities of those buried in the grave. The earth on the church grounds appeared to have been recently moved so it is feasible that more bodies could be buried there. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Sunday that reports emerging from towns in the Kyiv region revealed a ""post-apocalyptic picture"" of life under Russian occupation. ""This is a special appeal aimed at drawing the world's attention to those war crimes, crimes against humanity, which were committed by Russian troops in Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel,"" Arestovych said. ""These are liberated cities, a picture from horror movies, a post-apocalyptic picture."" ""Victims of these war crimes have already been found, including raped women who they tried to burn, local government officials killed, children killed, elderly people killed, men killed, many of them with tied hands, traces of torture and shot in the back of the head. Robberies, attempts to take gold, valuables, carpets, washing machines. It, of course, will be taken into account by the Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine and law enforcement agencies and international criminal courts."" The evidence of apparent atrocities in Bucha came as Human Rights Watch (HRW) announced it had documented allegations of war crimes in the occupied areas of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Kharkiv regions. HRW said Sunday that the allegations include ""a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022."" In Bucha, Russian forces ""rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them"" on March 4, HRW wrote. A witness told the group that soldiers forced the men to kneel on the road and pulled their shirts over their heads, before shooting one of the men in the back of the head. HRW also alleges that on February 27, six men were rounded up in the village of Staryi Bykiv in the Chernihiv region and later executed. In Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region, a Russian soldier repeatedly raped a woman in a school where she was sheltering with her family on March 13, the victim told HRW. ""She said that he beat her and cut her face, neck, and hair with a knife,"" HRW wrote. The woman fled to Kharkiv the following day, ""where she was able to get medical treatment and other services."" And in the village of Vorzel, 31 miles northwest of Kyiv, Russian soldiers ""threw a smoke grenade into a basement, then shot a woman and a 14-year-old child as they emerged from the basement, where they had been sheltering,"" HRW said. ""The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,"" Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe and Central Asia director, said in the statement. ""Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces' custody should be investigated as war crimes."" CNN has not independently verified the details of the HRW report and has requested comment from the Russian defense ministry. Sunday's developments in Ukraine have hastened calls for war crimes investigations. Blinken said the State Department would help document any atrocities the Russian military committed against Ukrainian civilians. ""You can't help but see these images as a punch to the gut,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" Sunday, when asked about the civilian killings in Bucha. ""Since the aggression, we've come out and said that we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes, and we've been working to document that, to provide the information we have to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together. And there needs to be accountability for it."" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement Sunday that ""indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians during Russia's illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes."" European Union Council President Charles Michel vowed further sanctions on Russia, while United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said an ""independent investigation"" into the civilians killed in Bucha was ""essential.""",13,1.7531996486117556,6.884789097020291,-5.131589448408535,19
2022-04-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/02/politics/russia-shifting-focus-victory-eastern-ukraine/index.html,"Russia shifting focus to show a victory by early May in eastern Ukraine, US officials say","Russia has revised its Ukraine war strategy to focus on trying to take control of the Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine with a target date of early May, according to several US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments. More than a month into the war, Russian ground forces have been unable to keep control of areas where they have been fighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin is under pressure to demonstrate he can show a victory, and eastern Ukraine is the place where he is most likely to be able to quickly do that, officials say. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin is focused on May 9, Russia's ""Victory Day,"" according to one of the officials. May 9 is a prominent holiday on the Russian calendar, a day the country marks the Nazi surrender in World War II with a huge parade of troops and weaponry across Red Square in front of the Kremlin. The officials say Putin wants to be able to celebrate a victory -- of some kind -- in his war on that day. But other officials note even if there is a Russian celebration, an actual victory may be further off. ""Putin will have a victory parade on 9th May regardless the status of the war or peace talks,"" a European defense official said. ""On the other hand: a victory parade with what troops and vehicles?"" Still, US and European officials say that any deadlines Moscow may set rhetorically don't change the reality on the ground that Russia appears to be preparing for the prospect of an extended conflict in Ukraine. A European diplomat said that while the Kremlin is talking optimistically, Putin is preparing for a ""Chechnya-style long, drawn-out war, because he, to a certain extent, has nowhere else to go on this."" There are several reasons behind the May time frame, the officials say. As the winter freeze ends and the ground softens, it will be harder for heavy Russian ground units to maneuver, meaning that it's vital for those forces to get into place as soon as possible, US intelligence assesses. Russian-backed fighters have also already been in that region for years. In 2014, Russian separatist forces took control of territory within the the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Putin announced he was recognizing two self-declared independent republics in the Donbas region. Ukrainian officials have publicly pointed to the date as well. ""Ahead of May 9, Putin set the goal of a victory parade for this war,"" Ukrainian Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Thursday. Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday that the Ukrainians believe they are facing a ""very complex and difficult"" situation as Putin tries meet a deadline. ""His ultimate goal is, was and will be to take over Ukraine, but he failed. He failed due to a very strong resolve of Ukrainian military and very strong unity of Ukraine and the Western world, and the sanctions that have been imposed by the United States and G7 and the European Union,"" Yatsenyuk said. ""So now, as far as I see, Putin switched to Plan B. My take is that this Plan B has a, kind of, deadline. The deadline is the ninth of May."" The US also assesses that Putin is now preparing for the first time to name an overall commander of the war to try to achieve greater Russian successes, two of the US officials said. The US belief is Putin will likely name a general who has been in the south because that is a place where the Russians have succeeded in their objectives. CNN previously reported there was no theater-wide commander on the ground in or near Ukraine, and units from different Russian military districts operating in different parts of Ukraine appear to be competing for resources rather than coordinating their efforts, according to two US defense officials. One of the signs the Russians are regrouping is that their troops pulling out of fighting areas north and east of Kyiv appear to have moved north, in some cases into Belarus, for resupply. The US believes this will put them in position to move southeast into the Donbas region. One Russian battlefield goal in Donbas would be to cut off Ukraine troops already there so they cannot fall back to defensive positions or link up with other Ukrainian forces, officials say. But a shift in the battlefield to the east on the ground may do little to stop the ongoing Russian air assaults by long-range missiles and aircraft throughout the rest of Ukraine, especially in the south.",14,8.480526906081991,3.880394278494941,4.60013262758705,21
2022-04-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/europe/ukraine-bucha-horrors/index.html,The horrors of Putin's invasion of Ukraine are increasingly coming to light,"Vladimir stands on the edge of a mass grave in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv. He holds his hands to his head, then raises them up to the sky in anguish. ""Brother, we've been looking for you for so long,"" he says, bursting into tears halfway through. His brother, Dmitry, has been missing for roughly a week and neighbors told Vladimir he might be buried here. ""We thought you were alive,"" Vladimir cries out. Inside the grave, the bodies are piled on top of one another, mostly inside black bags but some with limbs protruding from the soil. Only some are interred. A CNN team saw at least a dozen bodies on the mass grave, but the earth shows signs of recent movement, suggesting many more could lie beneath. Kyiv Regional Police and local residents say they believe at least 150 people were buried in the mass grave, but the mayor of Bucha says the death toll could be as high as 300. CNN could not independently verify their claims. Vladimir gathers himself, comforted by his wife, Anna, and a neighbour, Liubov, and leaves. He says he believes his brother is buried there, but the sad reality is he cannot know for sure -- and might not for a very long time as the town was only liberated from Russian forces over the weekend. Residents say the grave, on the grounds behind the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, started being dug early in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, such was the death toll in this leafy suburb of Kyiv. Satellite images from Maxar going back to March 10 show the trench already being dug. As Russian forces retreat from the area around Kyiv, the horrors of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine are increasingly coming to light. The death and destruction brought by Russia's war machine are on full display in Bucha, once an up-and-coming area on Kyiv's outskirts for young couples looking for relatively new housing developments, large lawns and good schools. But the invasion changed everything and artillery strikes have taken chunks out of Bucha's homes. One tree-lined road in the town is now littered with the warped remnants of a Russian convoy that was ambushed by Ukrainian forces. Most disturbingly, the Russian retreat has revealed at least 20 bodies lining a single street on Saturday. Some had their hands tied behind their backs, others lay crumpled under their bicycles, in what officials have described as an execution by the Russian occupiers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has blamed Russia for the killings and called on Moscow to put an end to the ""war crimes."" ""For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image,"" Zelensky said in a Sunday video address. For its part, Russia has denied any involvement, maintaining it doesn't target civilians and saying the images of bodies on the streets of Bucha are fake. Inside the district, the roads are littered with destroyed Russian armored vehicles -- including tanks -- ambushed by Ukrainian drones or units with NATO-supplied hand-held rocket launchers such as Javelins and Next-Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapons Systems, or NLAWs. In some cases, entire columns of Russian armored vehicles were trapped on narrow residential roads before being destroyed. ""They thought they could just drive on the streets and go through. That they would be greeted as though it's alright to come here,"" Valery Spichek, an officer with the Ukrainian National Police, tells us. ""Maybe they think it is normal to drive around looting, to destroy buildings and to mock people."" ""But our people didn't allow it,"" he adds. The vehicles are now rusting away where they stopped, evidence of the heavy losses Moscow suffered before being driven out of the area around Kyiv. The destruction extends to most buildings and other infrastructure around, with very few houses left intact, a majority unlivable after Russia's offensive on the capital. The scene in Bucha is similar to what CNN was able to see in other districts around Kyiv, such as Irpin, Myla, Hostomel and as far north as Bordyanka. In the latter, entire multistory buildings were razed by artillery shells as Ukrainians and Russians battled for control of the area. Authorities say they fear dead bodies are lying underneath the rubble, and that the real death toll is still impossible to measure. Konstantin Momotov, 69, chose to stay Bucha to look after his two dogs. ""Troops with the letter V, that means 'east,' arrived here. There were a lot of them. They began to shoot with anti-aircraft guns to intimidate. It was on the third day of the war,"" he told CNN. They killed his young neighbor, he said, but Momotov insisted that he was not afraid. ""I'm already old (and) I have sent my children to Poland."" Despite the carnage, residents who survived the horrors are picking up their lives again. People attempted to do their grocery shopping on Sunday as the news of the alleged atrocities spread across the globe. Western and Ukrainian officials are calling on the International Criminal Court to investigate the apparent killing of civilians in Bucha despite Russia's denials. In the town itself, grief is turning into deafening anger. Looking to the sky, Vladimir's neighbor Liubov addresses Russia and President Vladimir Putin. ""Why do you hate us so much? Since the 1930s, you have been abusing Ukraine. You just wanted to destroy us, wanted us gone. But ... everything will be okay. I believe it,"" she said.",17,5.280799997170357,4.523805336966775,0.7569946602035822,15
2022-04-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/02/europe/russia-ukraine-heavier-weaponry-military-focus-intl/index.html,Ukrainian presidential adviser calls for heavier weaponry as Russia shifts military focus,"As the Russian military shifts its campaign to focus on the east and south of Ukraine, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has called on the US and its allies to deliver heavier weaponry to the ex-Soviet nation. ""After the rapid retreat of the Russians from Kyiv and Chernihiv, it is clear that Russia has prioritized another tactic -- to move east/south, to control large occupied territories (not only in Donetsk and Luhansk regions) and to gain a strong foothold there,"" Podolyak said on Saturday. ""They have established in the east and south and are dictating harsh conditions,"" added Podolyak. ""So we definitely can't do without heavy weapons if we want to unblock the east and Kherson and send [back] the Russians as far as possible."" Last month the Russian military said the ""first stage"" of its invasion of Ukraine was complete and that it would withdraw forces from around Kyiv and Chernihiv to concentrate on the Donbas region in the country's east. Russia's announcement of that new phase in part may provide political cover for the Russian military, explaining heavy setbacks in the battles around Kyiv, but Ukrainian officials have also reported a ramping up of military activity and shelling in the Donbas by Russian forces. Podolyak alluded to an expectation from US and Western officials that Ukraine might need to prepare for further partisan warfare -- and referred to the Kremlin's bloody nine-year campaign to support the Marxist government in Kabul. ""Our partners must finally understand that the 'Afghanization' they want and the long-lasting exhausting conflict for Russia will not happen,"" he said. The war, which began when Soviet forces invaded in 1979, claimed nearly a million Afghan lives and 15,000 Russian troops, with a further 50,000 wounded. ""'Afghanization' is when there is a strong guerrilla resistance across the country that inflicts heavy losses on the aggressor for many months or even years and thus significantly weakens the power of the occupier's army,"" explained Podolyak. ""Such actions took place during the Soviet Union's attempt to control Afghanistan: Afghan guerrillas destroyed and weakened the Soviet occupiers for years. As a result, weakened Russia as a whole."" ""Russia will leave all Ukrainian territories except the south and east. And will try to dig in there, put in air defense and sharply reduce the loss of its equipment and personnel,"" Podolyak added. The US is expected to help facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine, a source familiar with the plan told CNN on Saturday. Officials have declined to say how many tanks will ultimately go to Ukraine. They will be Soviet-era T-72 tanks, which Ukrainian military personnel have experience operating, a senior US official told CNN. Those tanks will be delivered ""within days, not weeks,"" the official said, from NATO partner countries. The New York Times first reported on the transfer. The Ukrainian presidential adviser's comments came hours after the Russian ambassador to the United Kingdom, Andrei Kelin, said that if Britain delivers long-range artillery weapons and anti-ship systems to Ukraine, they would be ""legitimate targets"" for Russia. ""Any weapon deliveries are destabilizing, especially the ones mentioned by (Ben) Wallace (the British Defense Secretary),"" said Kelin, according to Russian state news agency TASS. ""They exacerbate the situation and make it bloodier."" ""Apparently, these are new, rather high-precision weapons. Of course, they will be legitimate targets for our armed forces if they cross the border of Ukraine."" ""I have a feeling that London's idea of what is happening in Ukraine militarily is formed on the basis of the bravado reports of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and the Ukrainian leadership,"" Kelin said. Russian officials have long complained about deliveries of advanced military weapons to Ukraine by the US, the UK, and other NATO allies, who have provided anti-tank weapons and man-portable air defenses -- some of which have enabled Ukrainian troops to blunt Russian advances.",14,3.213479089343342,3.7587461040415753,-0.5452670146982332,21
2022-04-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/01/europe/russia-ukraine-belgorod-fire-intl/index.html,Russia accuses Ukraine of helicopter strikes on fuel depot in Russian territory,"Russia accused Ukraine of mounting a helicopter attack on a fuel depot inside Russian territory Friday, as footage surfaced of the facility engulfed in flames. In a statement, Russia's Ministry of Defense said that the helicopters ""entered the airspace of the Russian Federation at extremely low altitude,"" at 5 a.m. Moscow time and ""launched a missile attack on a civilian oil storage facility located on the outskirts of Belgorod."" As a result, ""individual tanks were damaged and caught fire,"" spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said, adding that the depot ""has nothing to do with Russian armed forces."" CNN could not verify the Russian claims. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has neither confirmed nor denied the attack. Russia has hit fuel storage facilities around Ukraine in recent days. ""I would like to emphasize that Ukraine is performing a defensive operation against Russian aggression on the territory of Ukraine,"" Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, spokesman for Ukraine's defense ministry, said in a televised statement Friday. ""That doesn't mean Ukraine has to be responsible for every miscalculation or event or catastrophe that occurred on the territory of the Russian Federation. This is not the first time we are witnessing such accusations. Therefore, I will neither confirm nor deny this information."" CNN geolocated and verified social media videos showing two helicopters flying over the Russian city of Belgorod, near the Ukrainian border, but cannot confirm the helicopters are Ukrainian. In one video, they are spotted during an attack on a fuel storage facility. The video, which was shot at a distance of about 1,800 feet (550 meters) from the facility, shows multiple strikes and a subsequent fire in the distance. The Belgorod region -- which is on the road from Moscow to Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv -- has been a hub of fuel supplies that have powered Russia's invasion of of Ukraine. The ensuing fire ""engulfed fuel reservoirs"" at the facility, Russian state media outlet TASS reported, citing the ministry of emergency situations. About 16,000 cubic meters (3.52 million gallons) of fuel were on fire, encompassing eight tanks with 2,000 cubic meters of fuel each, Russian state media outlet Ria Novosti reported, citing emergency services, and there was the possibility that the fire could spread to another eight tanks. Two employees of the depot were injured in the fire but their lives were not in danger, Belgorod's regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on his Telegram channel earlier Friday. Residents in the vicinity of the depot were being evacuated but there was no threat to the population of the city, he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been informed about the alleged strike, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday, warning that the incident could hinder ongoing negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. ""The president was informed about Belgorod,"" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. ""You know that the ministry of emergency situations was sent there. Steps are being taken to reorganize fuel supply points so that what happened in no case affects the level of supply of all necessary types of fuel."" The Russian military has claimed air superiority over Ukraine. ""Air superiority during an operation is an absolute fact,"" Peskov said. ""And as for what happened, it probably should not be us giving out assessments, but our law enforcement agencies.""",17,2.519603793879778,6.70557791700775,-4.185974123127972,7
2022-04-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/01/politics/ukraine-security-guarantee-discussions/index.html,"The US and its allies are weighing security guarantees for Ukraine, but they're unlikely to give Kyiv what it wants","The US and its allies have been weighing how the West could provide Ukraine with alternative security guarantees should it forgo its NATO membership bid as a concession to Russia to end the war, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. The discussions, which have included the Ukrainians directly, are in very early phases because it is not clear to US, Western and Ukrainian officials that the Russian negotiations are anything more than a smokescreen. But it is unlikely, they noted, that the US and its allies will ultimately offer Ukraine the kinds of legally binding protections it is requesting. In peace talks with Russia in Istanbul this week, Ukrainian negotiators proposed that Ukraine might be willing to commit to neutrality when it comes to NATO. But at the same time, they want Western countries, including the US and UK, to guarantee via ratified treaties that they would protect Ukraine should Russia invade again in the future. Such an agreement would mirror NATO's Article V, which states that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all members. A main impetus for Russia's invasion was a desire to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO; it's unclear whether another collective security agreement would be any more palatable to Moscow. As a way for Russia to save face in the negotiations, the Ukrainians suggested that any such security guarantees would not apply to the separatist territories in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. ""We insist that this should be an agreement on security guarantees signed and ratified (by parliaments) to avoid repeating the mistake of the Budapest Memorandum,"" Ukrainian MP David Arakhamia, a chief Ukrainian negotiator with Russia, said this week. That memorandum is an agreement between the US, United Kingdom and Russia signed in 1994 that forced Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for protection from the signatories. Ukrainian officials have criticized that agreement as useless and even harmful -- the security commitments were not legally binding, and many of those nuclear weapons were given to Russia under the deal, bolstering its arsenal. A Western official told CNN that ""anything short of full commitment to defend Ukraine won't be enough for the Ukrainians,"" and some Biden administration officials acknowledge another Budapest Memorandum-type agreement would not be useful. A number of US and Western officials have taken a skeptical approach to potential security guarantees, with many saying it is still premature to discuss any contingencies as the negotiations proceed. Some US officials were surprised by the declaration from Ukraine after the Istanbul talks that Western security guarantees could be on the table. ""We are in constant discussion with Ukrainians about ways that we can help ensure that they are sovereign and secure,"" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said this week. ""But there is nothing specific about security guarantees that I can speak to at this time."" Other European officials said they were similarly waiting to hear more from the Ukrainians before committing to anything publicly. And a US official said talks were still in their earliest stages with Ukraine on the contours of what a security arrangement might look like. An Article V-type commitment, however, is unlikely given that the US and many of its allies, including the UK, are still not willing to put their troops in direct confrontation with Russian forces. The theory that Russia would not attack Ukraine if it had Western security guarantees appears to still be a bigger risk than the US and its allies are willing to take. ""Ukraine is not a NATO member,"" Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab told the BBC on Wednesday when asked whether the UK is prepared to become a guarantor of Ukrainian independence. ""We're not going to engage Russia in direct military confrontation,"" he said. European Union membership discussed as a solution Several European countries -- including Poland, Latvia, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic -- have been pushing for Ukraine to join the EU and believe membership could provide the country with some measure of protection. ""It would be difficult for Russia to attack an EU member country,"" said one European official. ""Because that automatically could involve much more support for that country."" But even the most fervently pro-EU members of Ukraine's parliament say that EU membership would not be enough to ensure their safety. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, the chair of the Ukrainian parliament's Committee on Ukraine's integration into the EU, said on Wednesday that while she has been a committed Euro-Atlanticist her entire professional life, ""I do not think that the EU would be that protective shield for (Ukraine) militarily as NATO could be."" NATO member countries, meanwhile, have not yet had robust discussions within the alliance about the Ukrainian security proposal, the EU official said, because they still do not trust that the Russians are negotiating with Ukraine in good faith -- and that any possible deal backed by Western security commitments could be quickly upended. Russia must first demonstrate that it is serious about retreating and commit to allowing Ukraine to maintain a robust military, essentially forfeiting demands that Ukraine ""demilitarize,"" the official said. But above all, the official added, Ukraine must first win the war and be given the support it needs to do so. Anastastia Radina, another member of Ukraine's parliament, said that Ukraine is looking for ""workable security guarantees and not just another Budapest Memorandum."" ""Let me just remind you that under the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine destroyed parts of our nuclear arsenal, but quite a bit has been passed to Russia,"" Radina said. ""Where did that get us? Hearing now that the world can do nothing to Russia because it has the world's largest nuclear arsenal. But we were pushed to contribute to that arsenal."" Echoing the European official, Radina said that the bottom line is that ""before proper talks of security guarantees can be in place, we actually need to ensure that Ukraine is winning this war."" ""What helps on the ground is weaponry,"" she added. ""And we asked for this weaponry to be delivered immediately. Preferably yesterday. The best option would have been the day before yesterday. This is how urgent it is.""",29,4.85384643550865,4.343232639728521,0.5106137957801291,26
2022-04-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/01/europe/ukraine-russia-donbas-analysis-cmd-intl/index.html,Russia may be intensifying its assault in eastern Ukraine. Here's what that means,"The Russian assault on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, may have abated for now, but fighting still rages in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, amid signs that it will become the focus of the war in coming weeks. On Thursday, US President Joe Biden said of Russian leader Vladimir Putin that ""thus far there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all of his forces out of Kyiv. There's also evidence that he is beefing up his troops down in the Donbas area."" And later that same day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned citizens of tough times ahead in the east, saying that in ""Donbas, Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes. Powerful blows. We will defend ourselves."" ""The situation in the southern direction and in the Donbas remains extremely difficult,"" Zelensky added. It was the second time in 24 hours he had warned of an expanding Russian offensive in Donbas. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also expects Donbas to become pivotal. ""Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region,"" he said Thursday. An analysis of what's happening on the ground in eastern Ukraine supports this view, with Russian armor and artillery intensifying their attacks, and yet more Ukrainian civilians fleeing westwards. The Russian offensive is being conducted in several directions simultaneously. Back to basics When Putin announced the invasion on February 24, he claimed the goal of Russia's so-called ""special military operation"" was the liberation of Donbas from neo-Nazis and the protection of its people from alleged ""genocide"" by the Ukrainian authorities. The Russian campaign since has been a smorgasbord of operations that have included a stuttering ground offensive and hugely destructive missile and artillery fire, and its ultimate goals are still difficult to divine. But the focus of Russia's military effort -- and rhetoric -- has recently shifted to the south and east of Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry's daily summaries have sought to focus on successes in these regions and, over the past week, various Russian officials have described the Donbas as the main goal of the operation, with other actions merely designed to pin down Ukrainian troops. On Wednesday, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces were regrouping in order to ""intensify operations in priority areas and, above all, to finish the operation for the complete liberation of Donbas."" At the same time, Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said the goal of the campaign was to secure all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Prior to the offensive, the separatist ""People's Republics"" controlled about one-third of the two regions. Gaining an accurate picture of the battlefield in the east is at best difficult -- but Russia and its allies in Luhansk and Donetsk are pounding Ukrainian-held towns and cities and edging forward. And yet they are still encountering stiff resistance from some of Ukraine's best units, more than a month after the invasion began. The devastation of the southeastern city of Mariupol, where an estimated 90% of buildings have been damaged in a month of fighting, is well known. It has been described as the new Aleppo, a reference to the Syrian city devastated by a Russian-backed siege in 2016. Much of Mariupol is now under Russian control, but its defenders are still tying down significant Russian and Chechen forces and inflicting heavy casualties. Russians claim progress Mariupol's horrors are not unique. Further north, cities like Izium, Rubizhne and Severodonetsk have also suffered widespread damage in weeks of fighting. Most are without power and water. Ukrainian troops are clinging on in Rubizhne and Severodonetsk, even if they are depopulated ruins, surrounded and bombarded daily. But on Friday the Ukrainian General Staff confirmed that Izium had fallen to the Russians after weeks of fighting. Ukrainian forces are now trying to prevent the Russians from pushing further south towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, which were briefly held by pro-Russian separatists in 2014 and would be significant gains. Ukrainian officials in the Donetsk region have this week reported Russian shelling and airstrikes along the entire ""line of contact"" which divided separatist-held areas from the rest of Ukraine before the Russian invasion. But that line is now history as Russian forces push beyond. According to Moscow's version of events, Russian forces are winning territory as they push westwards towards the regional borders. On Thursday, the Ministry of Defense said Russian troops had advanced 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) in a day and now hold the town of Zolotaya Niva. If true, that would put the Russians just 15 miles (25 km) from Donetsk's regional border. It's also become clear that the Russians are trying to cut the Ukrainians' fuel supplies: they hit another fuel dump near Dnipro on Thursday. The Ukrainian military insists that it is repelling Russian assaults throughout the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Serhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said Friday that Ukrainian forces had fought off attempts by Russian forces to bypass their positions west of the city of Luhansk. But the daily evacuation of civilians from towns such as Rubizhne, Bakhmut and Popasna suggests that Ukrainian forces are on the backfoot. ""We organize trains and buses to save as many lives of Ukrainians, residents of Luhansk region, as we can,"" Haidai said Thursday. But so far, he confirmed Friday, just 18,000 people have been evacuated from Luhansk, leaving hundreds of thousands enduring daily bombardment with scarce access to water and gas. Rapid gains 'unlikely' The danger for Ukrainian troops in this area is that they could get caught between Russian forces advancing from the east and other units that have pushed up -- with varying degrees of success -- from Crimea to the south. If the Russians reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk, they might even push onwards to the more defensible River Dnieper, on which the major cities of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro sit. But the performance of Russian ground forces in this conflict so far suggests they have a lot to do to secure both eastern provinces. The Institute for the Study of War, in its latest assessment, said that ""Russian force generation efforts and the redeployment of damaged units from the Kyiv axis are increasingly unlikely to enable Russian forces to make rapid gains in the Donbas region."" And Brian Mikalovsky, writing in Foreign Affairs, said the Russians' ""northern and southern invasion forces still have several lines of Ukrainian defenses and a few hundred kilometers of territory to cross before they can unite, and the [Ukrainian] army is fighting hard to prevent Russia from succeeding."" Mikalovsky, who lived in Severodonetsk until January, added: ""Dogged Ukrainian soldiers have torched multiple tank columns at the entrances to Severodonetsk. Russian forces moved into Rubizhne, but they have taken heavy casualties and have been able to seize just half of the city."" Even if the Russians succeed in grinding down the resistance in these eastern cities and towns, and give the Kremlin a way to declare victory, they will bequeath themselves a wasteland of destruction that will likely take decades and tens of billions of dollars to repair.",14,4.72175858936534,1.3919596719348208,3.3297989174305194,21
2022-03-31,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/europe/ukraine-russia-troops-regrouping-intl-cmd/index.html,Russia says its military is regrouping. A ramped-up assault on eastern Ukraine could be next,"Russia's military says it has moved on to a new phase of its so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, claiming that it is shifting its focus to the Donbas region in Ukraine's east. Is this regrouping of forces a feint -- allowing battered Russian forces to regroup after suffering serious losses at the hands of Ukrainian defenders -- or a simple face-saving measure? Is Russia actually moving troops and equipment to concentrate on Ukraine's east, where Moscow has recognized two separatist republics? On paper, that seems to be the case. Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said a ""planned regrouping of troops"" was underway around Kyiv and Chernihiv, one day after Russian negotiators said Moscow's forces would take steps toward de-escalation around those two cities. He said Russian forces were regrouping in order to ""intensify operations in priority areas and, above all, to complete the operation for the complete liberation of Donbas."" US officials and military analysts have rightly been skeptical of Russia's claims of de-escalation, and some observers have suggested Russia's shifting military objectives are meant to conceal massive setbacks on the battlefield. But there is evidence that Russian military activity is ramping up in the east: Ukrainian officials on Thursday reported heavy shelling of a number of Ukrainian cities, particularly in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions of the Donbas and around the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Escalating attacks in eastern Ukraine In a statement on Telegram, Oleh Synyehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said: ""Over the past day, Russian troops have struck 47 times with artillery, mortar, tank, and strikes in the areas of Piatihatky, Oleksiyivka, and the residential area of the Kharkiv Traсtor Plant district. About 380 shellings from Grad and Smerch [rocket artillery] were recorded. In Saltivka, the enemy damaged the gas pipeline, there was a major fire, and rescuers have worked to localize it."" Synyehubov said Russian forces had inflicted heavy fire on Derhachi, northwest of the city of Kharkiv, killing one person and injuring three others, and destroying a city council building. ""The fiercest point [in Kharkiv region] remains Izium, where fighting and constant shelling continue,"" he said. ""We are working every day to open 'green' [humanitarian] corridors. But so far Russia does not give us such an opportunity."" Ukrainian military governors in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions also reported heavy shelling Thursday amid an apparent shift by the Russian military to redirect military efforts to the Donbas region. ""We clearly feel that the transfer of [military] technology in our direction is beginning now,"" said Serhiy Haidai, Head of Luhansk region military administration, in televised remarks. ""And as the equipment and personnel are being turned over, our enemies are simply firing more densely, powerfully. Everything is already involved here: aircraft, artillery, heavy-caliber weapons, mortars — all settlements are being shelled."" Pavlo Kyrylenko, Head of Donetsk region military administration, said on Telegram that Russian forces overnight continued shelling in the central part of the region. ""In Maryinka, Krasnohorivka and Novomykhailivka, the enemy again used white phosphorous shells,"" he said, referring to munitions that are either banned or circumscribed under international law in populated areas. ""Eleven wounded civilians from the Maryinka community, including 4 children, were taken to the Kurakhiv City Hospital."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia never violates international conventions when asked to comment on a claim by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky regarding the alleged use of phosphorus bombs by Russian forces, Russian media reported. Questions about Russian troop morale Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement Thursday that Russian forces may indeed be regrouping on the territory of Belarus, which has been a staging area for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The statement said the movement of Russian military equipment had been observed in Belarus, ""probably for regrouping units, as well as creating a reserve to replenish losses in manpower, weapons and equipment of groups operating in Ukraine."" Outside analysis suggests that Russian troops have seen serious equipment losses and heavy casualties. The Russian military said nearly a week ago that 1,351 military personnel had been killed in Ukraine and 3,825 had been wounded, casualty figures that the US, Ukraine and NATO say represent a serious underreporting of troop losses. Jeremy Fleming, Director of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the UK spy agency speaking during a trip to Canberra, Australia, suggested that Russian troop morale was seriously plummeting and that Russian President Vladimir Putin -- who lives in an information bubble as well as in physical isolation -- may not be aware of the extent of the problem for his military. ""We've seen Russian soldiers -- short of weapons and morale -- refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft. And even though we believe Putin's advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what's going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime."" Putin on Thursday signed a decree to draft 134,500 Russians into the military to replace conscripts who are rotating out of service. The Russian military has a mixed manpower system that has draftees as well as contract servicemembers, and the country has a twice-annual call-up for conscription. Putin originally claimed that conscripts would not take part in the war, but the Russian defense ministry subsequently acknowledged that draftees were fighting in Ukraine -- and Ukrainian forces claim to have taken a considerable number of Russian conscripts prisoner. An intensifying humanitarian crisis The humanitarian situation remains grave in many Ukrainian cities, particularly in the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol. On Thursday, hopes were raised of the possibility that busloads of residents of Mariupol -- which has been under weeks of relentless shelling and bombing by Russian forces -- might be able to leave through a so-called humanitarian corridor. But the convoy was held up at a Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka, a city between the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia and the Russian-held city of Berdiansk, according to Iryna Vereshchuk, the Ukrainian minister for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories. Vereshchuk said about 100,000 people requiring immediate evacuation remain in the city, out of a pre-war population of over 400,000. ""That is, another 100,000 women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities who need our and the world's help,"" she said. Ukrainian officials say around 90% of the buildings in the city have been damaged or left uninhabitable after weeks of bombardment.",14,1.4673876322090178,5.088562651708263,-3.621175019499245,29
2022-03-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-hack-russian-ransomware-gang/index.html,'I can fight with a keyboard': How one Ukrainian IT specialist exposed a notorious Russian ransomware gang,"As Russian artillery began raining down on his homeland last month, one Ukrainian computer researcher decided to fight back the best way he knew how -- by sabotaging one of the most formidable ransomware gangs in Russia. Four days into Russia's invasion, the researcher began publishing the biggest leak ever of files and data from Conti, a syndicate of Russian and Eastern Europe cybercriminals wanted by the FBI for conducting attacks on hundreds of US organizations and causing millions of dollars in losses. The thousands of internal documents and communications include evidence that appears to suggest Conti operatives have contacts within the Russian government, including the FSB intelligence service. That supports a longstanding US allegation that Moscow has colluded with cybercriminals for strategic advantage. The Ukrainian computer specialist behind the leak spoke exclusively to CNN and described his motivation for seeking revenge after Conti operatives published a statement in support of the Russian government immediately after the invasion of Ukraine. He also described his desperate efforts to track down loved ones in Ukraine in recent weeks. To protect his identity, CNN agreed to refer to him by a pseudonym: Danylo. ""I cannot shoot anything, but I can fight with a keyboard and mouse,"" Danylo told CNN. The trove of data Danylo leaked in late February illustrates why cybersecurity has been such a fraught issue in US-Russia relations. It includes cryptocurrency accounts the Conti hackers used to allegedly reap millions of dollars in ransom payments, their discussions of how to extort US companies and their apparent targeting of a journalist investigating the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny. But it also shows how hard it can be to disable ransomware operations. Despite Danylo unmasking their operations, the hackers continue to announce new victim organizations. Danylo, who has worked as a cybersecurity researcher for years and studied the underground cybercriminal economy in Europe, is just one vigilante in a shadow war that has emerged between hackers and cybersecurity executives who have pledged support for the Ukrainian and Russian governments as the biggest land war in Europe since World War II drags on. But by disrupting a group as notorious as Conti, Danylo has gained more attention than others. The FBI, Danylo said, contacted him after he began to leak the Conti files, asking him to stop leaking. The FBI declined to comment. CNN corroborated Danylo's claim that he was the leaker by reviewing evidence that he had access to the Twitter account that was publishing the Conti data, as well as a website that Danylo and another person, who was granted anonymity for their protection, were using to share data contained in the leaks. Danylo hasn't spoken with the media about his motives -- until now. He did so while navigating a war-ravaged country he had only recently returned to and could hardly recognize. ""It's my country,"" he said in a phone interview. ""If they [the Ukrainian government] provide me weapons, OK, I'll go fight. But I'm better at typing."" Digital retribution Danylo claims that he first gained access to computer systems used by what would become the Conti syndicate in 2016. Though he declined to explain in detail how he did this, independent security experts have verified to CNN the dataset belongs to the hackers. (Conti is both the name of malicious software and the cybercriminal syndicate that uses it. The group is also affiliated with TrickBot, another hacking tool used in numerous ransomware attacks.) ""Sometimes they make mistakes,"" Danylo said, referring to ransomware groups. ""You need to catch them when they make a mistake. I just was in the right place at the right time. I was monitoring them."" For years, Danylo said, he quietly lurked on the hackers' computer servers and would pass along information on the group's operations to European law enforcement officials. Conti ransomware has been rampant in the last two years, with the hackers claiming numerous victims a week. In September 2020, the hackers claimed to have stolen case files from a district court in Louisiana. In March 2021, Conti ransomware was used in a hack that hobbled the computer networks of Ireland's $25 billion public health system, disrupting a maternity ward in Dublin. The dark work was lucrative: hackers using the Conti ransomware received at least $25.5 million in ransom payments in the span of just four months in 2021, according to Elliptic, a firm that tracks cryptocurrency transactions. But something snapped in Danylo on February 25, 2022, when Conti operatives published a statement pledging their ""full support"" for the Russian government as it attacked Ukraine. A Russian airstrike had landed not far from a family member's house. The cybersecurity researcher grew up in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union. He didn't want to see it slip back into Russian hands. Conti members tried to walk their statement back, claiming they weren't supporting any government, but Danylo had heard enough. Asked again why he dumped the Conti data, Danylo said with a laugh: ""To prove that they are motherf**kers."" He was exhausted from a long day navigating military checkpoints in Ukraine, on the hunt for cigarettes and looking to the sky for signs of the next air raid. Contacted by the FBI Conti is exactly the type of prolific ransomware group that President Joe Biden last year exhorted Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring to heel amid a spate of attacks on US critical infrastructure. The Kremlin appeared to dangle the prospect of collaborating with the US to combat cybercrime this January, when the Russian FSB intelligence agency announced the arrest of multiple accused cybercriminals. But the chances of bilateral cooperation on cybercrime have dimmed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has killed more than 1,000 civilians, according to the United Nations, and made Putin an international pariah. After he started leaking the data, Danylo said, an FBI special agent contacted him and asked him to stop. Exposing Conti infrastructure could, in theory, make it more difficult for the FBI to track the group because it might set up new computer systems. Danylo has stopped leaking for now. But he says he still has access to some Conti computer systems. At least one law enforcement official who spoke to CNN would have preferred that Danylo had maintained that covert access, rather than alert the ransomware syndicate to his presence by leaking the data. ""Publicly releasing information like [the leaker did] is reckless,"" a US law enforcement official told CNN. ""Working cooperatively with law enforcement can achieve a more substantial and lasting impact in disrupting the operations of groups like Conti."" But John Fokker, a former cybercrime investigator with the Dutch police, said the leak could actually be useful to cops chasing cyber crooks. ""Yes, infrastructure can be burned. However, the amount of data provided in the leaks make me confident that law enforcement got the information they need to write indictments on key individuals,"" said Fokker, who works closely with European law enforcement as head of cyber investigations at security firm Trellix. A catalog of misdeeds The Conti leaks are a startling catalog of the alleged misdeeds of a multimillion-dollar criminal enterprise. CNN evaluated and translated the original cache of documents that Danylo shared with the world via Twitter. The communications show Conti members, each going by aliases in the chat logs, discussing the wisdom of extorting US small businesses, seemingly refraining from hacking Russian targets, and taking an interest in a journalist writing about Navalny, the Russian opposition figure who has been jailed and poisoned. In April 2021, Conti members ""mango"" and ""johnyboy77"" discussed plans to access files belonging to a journalist for investigative outlet Bellingcat, which had published a joint investigation with CNN in December 2020 on the alleged role of the Russia's FSB intelligence agency in the poisoning of Navalny. ""Bro, don't forget about Navalny, I flagged it to the boss -- he's waiting for details,"" mango wrote to johnyboy77 in Russian. It's unclear who ""the boss"" is in this exchange. But Christo Grozev, Bellingcat's lead Russian investigator, tweeted that the leaked chat corroborated an anonymous tip that Bellingcat received stating that a ""'global cyber crime group acting on an FSB order has hacked one of your contributors.'"" Conti operatives refer in their chats to Liteyny Avenue in St. Petersburg, which happens to be home to local FSB offices, according to Kimberly Goody, director of cyber crime analysis at security firm Mandiant. ""Generally speaking, it would be relatively unsurprising to learn that an operation as extensive as this would not in some way be leveraged as an asset [by the Russian government] at a point in time,"" Goody told CNN. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The Russian government has long denied accusations that it turns a blind eye to cybercrime. There also appears to be a correlation between the Conti leaks and public warnings from US cybersecurity officials, suggesting that federal authorities have been closely watching the group. On October 26, 2020, as US hospitals continued to reel from coronavirus cases, a Conti member with the alias Troy wrote to another member in Russian: ""F**k clinics in the USA this week ... There will be panic. 428 hospitals."" Two days later the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a dire warning about ransomware attacks on hospitals, many of which used a piece of malicious software that the leaked documents tie to Conti operatives. It was unclear what specific intelligence prompted the federal warning about the hospitals, but the timing was striking. 'It's my work' Cyberattacks have played a supporting role in the war in Ukraine. The White House has accused the Russian GRU military intelligence agency of knocking key Ukrainian government websites offline prior to the invasion. (A charge the Kremlin denies.) US officials are also investigating a hack of a satellite network serving parts of Ukraine, which occurred as the Russian invasion began, as a potential Russian state-sponsored hack, CNN previously reported. For its part, the Ukrainian government has encouraged an ""IT army"" of volunteer hackers in Ukraine and abroad to conduct cyberattacks on Russian organizations. In the free-for-all that is Ukrainian cyberspace, combatants like Danylo engage on their own terms. Asked how he's been in recent days, Danylo's replies have been consistent: ""Still alive."" Seeing houses and schools turn to rubble has drained the vigor from his voice. Danylo recalled, in the early days",3,6.642600511376715,7.559759506217411,-0.9171589948406957,18
2022-03-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/europe/ukraine-russia-bombardment-intl/index.html,Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities blunts hopes of swift breakthrough,"Hopes of an early breakthrough in war-ravaged Ukraine were fading Wednesday as Russian forces continued to pound the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv, a day after Moscow said it would ""drastically reduce"" its military assault there. Officials in Ukraine said there had been no reduction in hostilities overnight and the mayor of Chernihov told CNN of a ""colossal attack"" on his city Wednesday, despite apparent progress in talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul, Turkey, the day before. Images emerged showing the extent of destruction in the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, where whole city blocks appear to have been wiped out during weeks of bombardment. ""There was an air alarm throughout the country during the night. In fact, there were no areas without sirens. In the morning they were repeated,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said Wednesday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that there had been no breakthroughs after the negotiations in Istanbul, but that Russia welcomed Ukraine's written demands. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said the previous day that enough progress had been made in the talks to allow Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet. Kyiv and Irpin Despite those promising words, the situation in the capital, Kyiv, and surrounding areas remained tense on Wednesday. Military strikes continued on Tuesday evening around Kyiv and there were reports of rocket fire overnight. ""In Kyiv, several rockets were shot down over the capital,"" said Denysenko. There were also reports of fighting near the northwestern suburb of Irpin overnight, he said. ""So there is no need to say so far that the Russians are reducing the intensity of hostilities in Kyiv and Chernihiv directions,"" he said. ""We can say that, yes, indeed, certain units and equipment are moving to the territory of Belarus. But it seems to be more like rotation and licking of wounds than a real cessation of hostilities."" In a video message on Wednesday night, Zelensky said the ""alleged pullback"" of Russian troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv is not a retreat but a result of the work of the Ukrainian military. He added that Russian troops are concentrating in the Donbas region for new attacks, saying Ukrainians are ""ready for this."" US officials on Tuesday also voiced skepticism over Russia's claims. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby warned that Russian troop movement near Kyiv was likely ""a repositioning, not a real withdrawal"" and that the threat to Kyiv was not over. The full extent of the devastation in Irpin was revealed in new video taken Tuesday by a Ukrainian NGO and provided to CNN. Filmed after Ukrainian forces pushed Russian troops out of the city at the start of the week, the video shows the wooded suburb reduced to a wasteland, with scattered debris, splintered trees and destroyed buildings all around. Gunfire and bombing may have stopped for now in Irpin, but there is little sign of life. At least five bodies are seen in the video; it's unclear how and when they died. Not much can be heard in the video except for the sound of wind blowing through the few trees that remain standing, the clank of metal sheets, and the dull thud of a distant military strike. Chernihiv The northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, which lies about halfway between Kyiv and the Russian border, has endured intense shelling in recent weeks. There are few signs that the Russian assault on the city is over. Viacheslav Chaus, head of the Chernihiv regional administration, said the city was under fire from Russian airstrikes while shelling continued through the night. And in an interview with CNN's John Berman, the city's mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, hit out at Russia's claim that it planned to ""drastically reduce"" its military assault on Chernihiv and Kyiv, saying it was ""yet another confirmation that Russia always lies."" According to Atroshenko, Russian attacks on Chernihiv have actually increased since the claim was made Tuesday. ""They're saying reducing intensity, they actually have increased the intensity of strikes,"" he said. ""Today we have a colossal attack on the center of Chernihiv. Twenty-five people have been wounded and are now in hospitals. They're all civilians. So whenever Russia says something, this needs to be checked carefully."" In an interview posted on Telegram on Wednesday, Chaus similarly said the situation in the region had not changed despite claims by Russia. Russian troops had carried out strikes on the city of Nizhyn, he said, destroying ""civil infrastructure"" as well as ""libraries, shopping malls and many residential buildings,"" while in Chernihiv there is ""no electricity, no water, no heat and no gas."" Communications are down with ""no possibility to restore them,"" making it difficult to reach isolated villages, Chaus added. ""There are villages where Russian tanks are stationed. We know that there are our people there and the situation is the worst there, because we are not able to get there and bring either medicine or food."" Ukrainian troops are prepared and are fighting back against Russian troops in the Chernihiv region, he added. Mariupol Meanwhile, new satellite images from Maxar Technologies show that entire city blocks in central Mariupol have been obliterated -- a level of destruction not previously evident in the besieged Ukrainian city. With communications in and out of Mariupol non-existent, the images are the first visual update in the past few days that have not come from Russian propaganda. The images confirm what sensory satellite data from NASA had picked up: Dozens of explosions have taken place in and around Mariupol. The area just east of the bombed drama theater -- where authorities believe about 300 people died in a Russian attack -- is in ruins. In one satellite image, the roofs are either missing or have been significantly damaged on nearly every building. In eastern Mariupol, another residential area has sustained similar destruction. Every house surrounding two separate apartment complexes is destroyed. Another sprawling apartment complex in southeastern Mariupol, near the Azovstal iron and steel works factory, has been destroyed. CNN has previously confirmed that Russian troops and Chechen fighters have been active near that apartment complex. Another image from Maxar confirms an allegation by Ukraine's Azov Battalion -- a unit that began as an ultra-nationalist militia but has since integrated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces -- that the Red Cross warehouse in Mariupol was hit by military strikes. The satellite images also show survivors of the carnage. Outside the Metro supermarket in western Mariupol, hundreds of people are seen gathered in lines, waiting to enter the building. Its roof has holes from military strikes. Just northeast of the city, Russian military positions can been seen, including vehicles parked directly next to homes. Towed artillery positions are seen just northeast of those vehicles. Mariupol's mayor estimated that as many as 160,000 people remained in the city as of Monday.",17,4.962584404623031,6.161721519712402,-1.1991371150893713,29
2022-03-30,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-cyberattack-viasat-satellite/index.html,US satellite operator says persistent cyberattack at beginning of Ukraine war affected tens of thousands of customers,"A multi-faceted cyberattack at the onset of Russia's war on Ukraine knocked out internet service for tens of thousands of satellite modems in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, the US-based telecommunications provider that owns the network said Wednesday. It's the most detailed public account yet of one of the most consequential hacks of the war. US officials are investigating the incident as a potential Russian state-sponsored cyberattack, CNN previously reported. The hackers not only flooded the satellite modems owned by Viasat, a California-based firm, with traffic to knock them offline, but also used ""destructive commands"" to overwrite key data on the modems, Viasat said in its report -- a sign of how intent the hackers were on disrupting service in Ukraine. The hack occurred February 24 as the Russian military began their onslaught against Ukraine. A top Ukrainian cyber official, Victor Zhora, on March 15 called the hack ""a really huge loss in communications in the very beginning of the war."" Reuters first reported on the Viasat findings Wednesday. Viasat has been working to respond to the hack in the weeks since. It has shipped nearly 30,000 modems to customers to get them back online, the firm said Wednesday. ""The nature of this and other ongoing attacks we routinely see are dynamic, and we're constantly updating our tools and mitigations to ensure that the network is stable and secure,"" a Viasat spokesperson told CNN. The US government is still investigating the hack. ""We do not have an attribution to share at this time and are looking at this closely,"" Saloni Sharma, spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in an email Wednesday. ""As we have already said, we are concerned about the apparent use of cyber operations to disrupt communications systems in Ukraine and across Europe and affect businesses and individuals' access to the Internet."" Viasat hired US cybersecurity firm Mandiant to investigate the incident. Mandiant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The hack affected residential modems on Viasat's KA-SAT satellite network, Viasat said Wednesday. ""This cyber-attack did not impact Viasat's directly managed mobility or government users on the KA-SAT satellite,"" the firm added. ""It isn't surprising that the effects of the attack were not limited to Viasat residential customers on Ukrainian territory,"" Brian Kime, a vice president at cybersecurity firm ZeroFox, told CNN. ""Collateral damage happens in all wars and, if this was directed by Putin's government and successfully targeted government and military customers of Viasat, there easily could have been a similar impact on non-Ukrainian customers, including NATO members."" The battle for communications during the war in Ukraine has made satellite owners and other telecommunications providers a prime target for hacking. Triolan, an internet service provider with customers in key Ukrainian cities, said March 10 that a cyberattack had disrupted service and blamed ""the enemy"" in an apparent reference to Russia. For their part, Ukrainian officials have encouraged volunteer hackers to hit Russian organizations involved in the war.",3,9.384389979211058,8.742263117675085,0.6421268615359725,23
2022-03-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/ukraine-russia-istanbul-talks-analysis-tuesday-intl-cmd/index.html,Russia-Ukraine talks offer roadmap to a truce -- but one that passes through a minefield,"When the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met in Turkey just 19 days ago, the atmosphere was toxic -- and neither side got far beyond restating existing positions. Today, at a meeting in Istanbul between Russian and Ukrainian teams, the atmospherics were a great deal more positive and the outlines, however faint, of an overall settlement to this horrendously destructive war began to come into focus. They included the future of Crimea and the Donbas region, Ukraine's neutral status, protected by security guarantees, a notable pull-back of Russian forces currently north of Kyiv and even the prospect of a meeting between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian side accepted kicking into the long grass the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said of the future of Crimea, whose annexation has never been accepted by either Ukraine or other Western countries: ""It was agreed in bilateral format to take a pause for 15 years and conduct bilateral talks on the status of these territories. ""Separately we discussed that during the 15 years while the bilateral talks take place there will be no military hostilities,"" he told reporters. This would take one of the most contentious issues off the table for now. Both sides seemed to be in a constructive mood. Podolyak said the Russian negotiators have ""taken the treaty that outlines ways to end the war and will work out their counter proposals."" Russian news agency TASS quoted the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, as saying that the talks were constructive. And he said that ""Russia is taking two steps towards Ukraine for de-escalation."" The most immediate of those is the Russian declaration that hostilities against Chernihiv and in the direction of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, would be drastically reduced. Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine, has been surrounded by Russian forces and has suffered devastating destruction over the past three weeks. As significantly, Medinsky said that the Ukrainian proposals were now sufficiently formulated for them to ""be presented to the President. And our appropriate response will be given."" ""Provided that the agreement is worked on quickly and a compromise is found, the opportunity to conclude peace will become closer,"" Medinsky said -- the most upbeat assessment from a Russian official since the first round of talks at the end of February. Russian officials have previously played down any involvement in the process of Putin, saying that more needed to be negotiated before the Russian leader personally sits down for direct talks. Now, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti -- citing the Russian delegation -- spoke of the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky simultaneously with the initialing of the peace treaty by the foreign ministers of both countries. Turkish Foreign Minister, Mevlüt Cavusoglu, who brokered the talks, sketched out a possible roadmap, with the ""top priority of achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible to pave the way for a permanent political solution."" Those ""trickier"" issues would be bumped up to the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers to ""make final adjustments to the common approach."" And then a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would be on the agenda, he said in remarks to reporters after the talks. An outline emerges For Ukraine, security guarantees have always been a critical part of any settlement to the conflict. Gradually, President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have walked away from Ukraine's past insistence that it has the right -- even the obligation -- to apply for NATO membership, as is enshrined in the Ukrainian constitution. Now a very different formulation is emerging. One member of the Ukrainian team, Davyd Arakhamia, said after the meeting to Ukrainian TV: ""We insist that this be an international treaty, signing all the guarantors of security, which will be ratified."" That treaty would have to be ratified by parliaments in the guarantor countries, according to Ukrainian officials, who are evidently building as much insurance into the mechanism as possible. The Ukrainians also want the guarantors to include the permanent members of the UN Security Council -- Russia included. The guarantees would be very specific, Arakhamia said. In the event of aggression or a military operation directed at Ukraine, ""consultations should take place within three days."" ""After that, the guarantor countries are obliged to help us. And military aid, and the armed forces, and weapons, and the closed sky — everything that we need so much now, and we cannot get it."" The Ukrainians are now looking at what might be called protected -- and permanent -- neutrality. Another member of the Ukrainian delegation, Oleksandr Chalyi, put it this way: ""Doing everything possible to restore Ukraine's security is a key requirement. If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, which is the most fundamental requirement for us, Ukraine will in fact be in a position to fix its current status as a non-aligned and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality."" Significantly, Chalyi went on : ""[We] will not deploy foreign military bases or military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances. Military training in our country will be conducted with the consent of our guarantor countries."" That is and always has been at the heart of Putin's demands, expressed in long speeches before he announced the start of what Putin called a ""special military operation."" Swapping NATO for the European Union It's becoming clearer that in return for forswearing the ambition of NATO membership, Ukraine expects a fast track to membership of the European Union -- which it wants to be assisted by the guarantor countries. It's likely that the prospect of EU membership -- which is hugely popular among Ukrainians -- would help get an overall deal approved in the national referendum that the Ukrainian government has promised to approve neutrality with security guarantees. There is still a long way to go of course. Principles have been set out, but the detail, the sequencing and the language may be a minefield. Podolyak said: ""Undoubtedly, this treaty on security guarantees may only be signed after a ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Russian troops to their positions on February 23, 2022."" While the Russians have agreed to reduce the operations of their forces north of Kyiv, that still leaves plenty of fighting underway: In the east, the northeast and the south. Even before he left the negotiating venue, Medinsky warned that the ""gradual de-escalation"" in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv ""does not mean a ceasefire. But he said: ""We understand that there are people in Kyiv who need to make decisions, so we do not want to expose this city to additional risk."" And so the clock is ticking. If the talks stutter or fail, Russian forces redeploying from the north of Kyiv could reinforce those trying to make headway in the east and south. Indeed, just this weekend Ukraine's military intelligence chief warned that Putin could be looking to carve Ukraine in two -- like North and South Korea. ""There is reason to believe that he is considering a 'Korean' scenario for Ukraine. That is, [Russian forces] will try to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine,"" Kyrylo Budanov said Sunday. Not only is there a lot of negotiating to be done -- in the absence of a comprehensive ceasefire. There's not much trust on the Ukrainian side of the Kremlin's intentions. And as they never tire of saying, ultimately what happens is down to one man and one man only: Vladimir Putin.",29,4.471379735989414,5.616732940220461,-1.1453532042310473,26
2022-03-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/world/nasa-vande-hei-cosmonauts-return-scn/index.html,"NASA astronaut, Russian cosmonauts land in Kazakhstan","After a record-breaking 355 days spent in space, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is back on Earth. In a Russian Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft, Vande Hei and cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov undocked from the International Space Station at 3.21 a.m. ET Wednesday. They touched down after a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan at 7:28 a.m. ET. The spacecraft experienced its deorbit burn at 6:34 a.m. ET Wednesday, which lasted over four minutes and helped slow the Soyuz down. Each step of the crew's return was streamed live on NASA's TV channel and website. The Soyuz landed upright but ended up on its side due to winds pulling the parachute. Recovery teams assisted the crew in leaving the capsule. After landing, the Russian mission control center's main screen shared the message, ""Welcome back, Mark!"" in English and ""Touchdown!"" in Russian. It was a highly anticipated return that has only drawn more attention due to mounting geopolitical tensions over the past month, and NASA has repeatedly reaffirmed that it continues to work closely with Russian space agency Roscosmos. After a health check and a two-hour helicopter ride to the recovery staging city of Karaganda, Kazakhstan, Vande Hei will travel back to Houston aboard a Gulfstream jet, as other NASA astronauts have done before, and the cosmonauts will return to their training base in Star City, Russia. Vande Hei's NASA plane will make a stop in Colonge, Germany, for refueling before heading home. Joint operations between NASA and Roscosmos at the Russian facilities at Baikonur, Kazakhstan, ""continue to go well,"" said Joel Montalbano, the manager of NASA's International Space Station program, during a press conference on March 14. Montalbano's remarks came as Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin made several fiery social media posts directed at the United States, including a heavily edited, partially animated video that appeared to threaten that Russian astronauts would abandon Vande Hei in space. Rogozin has long been known to share outlandish statements on social media. Former astronaut Scott Kelly just recently backed off of a Twitter war with Rogozin. Vande Hei and Dubrov launched to the space station in April 2021, and together they have completed 5,680 orbits of Earth and traveled more than 150 million miles around our planet. Vande Hei has now broken the record for the longest single spaceflight by an American astronaut, which previously was set by Kelly at 340 days. The extended mission will allow researchers to study the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human body, like the Twins Study that Kelly and his twin, Mark, participated in during Scott's long duration. The insights gathered from extended missions can better prepare NASA to send astronauts to the moon and on to Mars, according to the agency. ""Mark's mission is not only record-breaking, but also paving the way for future human explorers on the Moon, Mars, and beyond,"" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement. ""Our astronauts make incredible sacrifices in the name of science, exploration, and cutting-edge technology development, not least among them time away from loved ones. NASA and the nation are proud to welcome Mark home and grateful for his incredible contributions throughout his year-long stay on the International Space Station."" This was Vande Hei's second spaceflight, so he has logged a total of 523 days in space. It was Dubrov's first flight. Meanwhile, Shkaplerov arrived on the space station in October along with a Russian director and actress who filmed the first movie in space. While they returned to Earth just weeks after their arrival, Shkaplerov remained on the space station and ends his fourth space mission with 708 total days spent in space. Change of command Shkaplerov handed over command of the International Space Station to NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn Tuesday morning. Before handing Marshburn a ceremonial ""key"" to the space station, signifying the change in command, Shkaplerov reflected on his time in space, including some of the situations the crew have faced. ""It's like some satellites tried to kill us,"" he said, causing the assembled crew of 10 astronauts and cosmonauts to laugh. His comment was in reference to a Russian anti-satellite test that created debris in November. He also reinforced the close-knit and familial nature of the space station crew, especially given current geopolitical tensions. ""People have problems on Earth,"" he said. ""On orbit, we are one crew, and I think ISS is like a symbol of the friendship, cooperation (and) our flexible future of exploration of space. Thank you very much, my crew members. You are like my space brothers and space sister."" Marshburn said it was an honor and privilege to accept command of the space station, ""continuing the international partnership and that legacy in spaceflight."" Marshburn thanked Shkaplerov for being a ""wonderful commander."" ""I can't thank you enough for your dedication to the safety of the station, the safety of your crew, your humor, your friendship and your dedication to the flight control teams around the world,"" Marshburn said. Comings and goings After the departure of Vande Hei, Dubrov and Shkaplerov, the remaining space station crew includes Marshburn, along with NASA astronauts Raja Chari and Kayla Barron, European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer and the recently arrived Russian cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov. When the Russian trio docked with the space station on March 15, they sparked speculation by donning bright yellow spacesuits trimmed with blue. It raised questions about whether the three were showing solidarity with Ukraine by wearing its national colors and rebuking their own government's invasion. So far, no definitive answer has been given. The space station won't be home to a crew of seven for long. The private Axiom Space-1 mission, carrying former NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria and US crew members Larry Connor, Eytan Stibbe and Mark Pathy, is launching to the space station no earlier than April 6. The Axiom crew will return after 10 days. Then, NASA's SpaceX Crew-4 mission will bring NASA astronauts Kjell Lindgren, Bob Hines and Jessica Watkins, as well as ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, to the space station later in April. No spacewalks are currently on the schedule during this time of heavy crew rotation. NASA continues to investigate a ""more than normal"" amount of water discovered inside Maurer's helmet after his first spacewalk on March 23. A thin layer of water was found inside his helmet once he returned to the airlock nearly seven hours after beginning the spacewalk. The crew are trying to understand what caused this and determine how to fix it. ""The agency and our international partners are constantly identifying and mitigating risks of human spaceflight,"" according to a NASA statement.",3,6.428251876440345,8.929504824346685,-2.50125294790634,11
2022-03-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/russia-reduce-assault-kyiv-plan-intl/index.html,Russia says it will reduce military operations around Kyiv following talks with Ukraine,"Russia said it would ""drastically reduce"" its military assault on the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv after talks took place between representatives of the two nations on Tuesday that appeared to show signs of progress towards an off ramp to the conflict. The Russian defense ministry has decided to ""radically, at times, reduce military activity"" in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv, deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin said, state media RIA reported. The ministry's Telegram channel also said that Moscow would ""drastically reduce military activity"" in the cities. The announcement comes after Ukrainian and Western intelligence assessments suggested in recent days that Russia's advance on Kyiv was stalling. Talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul, Turkey on Tuesday covered an array of important issues, including the future of the eastern Donbas region, the fate of Crimea, a broad alliance of security guarantors and a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Fomin told reporters that the ongoing discussions regarding the ""neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine"" had contributed to the decision. More details on the steps to reduce hostilities will follow after the Russian delegation returns from Istanbul, Fomin said in remarks carried by Russian state news agency TASS. Despite the announcement, intense fighting continued around the suburbs of Kyiv on Tuesday afternoon, especially in the northwest and northeast of the city. Ukraine echoed the announcement regarding the reduction in military action, saying some Russian troops were pulling back from Kyiv and Chernihiv. ""The Russian enemy did not meet the goal of its offensive operation,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in an official Facebook update Tuesday, adding that ""certain units"" of Russia's military were withdrawing from battlefronts in the cities. However it warned of a ""high risk"" of Russian troops attacking military and civilian infrastructure. The Russian military, it claimed, was struggling to reinforce and rotate in new soldiers, due to the ""refusal of personnel to participate in the so-called special operation,"" and are ""not able to staff even one battalion-tactical group."" Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, said Russia's operations around Kyiv had failed and it was now impossible for the Russian army to overthrow the Ukrainian government. Putin's war is now focused on the south and the east of the country, he said. ""There is reason to believe that he is considering a 'Korean' scenario for Ukraine,"" said Budanov. ""That is, [Russian forces] will try to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine."" Still, enough progress was made during Tuesday's talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations to allow Putin and Zelensky to meet, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. Speaking in Istanbul after the talks between the two sides ended, Podolyak said there was now a ""likelihood"" that the two presidents may meet. ""We have documents prepared now which allow the presidents to meet on a bilateral basis,"" he said. Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti, citing the Russian delegation, also reported the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky. The head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, called the negotiations ""constructive,"" RIA reported. Podolyak also said that talks between the two parties will ""continue online 24/7,"" adding that Ukraine needs ""clear legal wording."" He referred to talks about the status of Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. ""It was agreed in bilateral format to take a pause for 15 years and conduct bilateral talks on the status of these territories (Crimea and Sevastopol),"" he said. Ukraine and the West have refused to recognize the Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula, and the pause could be a formula for taking the issue off the table for now. Podolyak added that they had separately discussed that ""no military hostilities"" take place over those 15 years. The issue of security guarantees was also discussed. Another member of the Ukrainian team, Davyd Arakhamia said, ""We insist that this be an international treaty, signing all the guarantors of security, which will be ratified."" This would be comparable to NATO's Article 5, which enshrines the principle of collective defense, he said. Podolyak also said that both sides are still ""discussing a humanitarian ceasefire,"" stressing there are ""many places where humanitarian corridors are needed."" Over 3.9 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the start of the war, according to UNHCR. Chernihiv, which lies about halfway between Kyiv and the Russian border, has endured intense shelling in recent weeks. Videos geolocated by CNN show heavy damage in civilian areas. On Saturday, Chernihiv Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko announced the city was surrounded by Russian forces, leaving no safe pathways in or out. He told CNN on Tuesday that between 300 and 400 people, mostly civilians, had been killed in the last three weeks. ""We don't have the exact figure because we can only count those who died in a hospital, but if people die from an explosion, we cannot always identify them,"" Atroshenko said. Shifting strategies The United States also believes Russia is executing a major strategy shift and withdrawing some forces from the area around Kyiv, two senior US officials told CNN on Tuesday. The Russian forces are now pulling back in some areas of the north to focus on gains in the south and east, the US believes. The US has already observed these movements underway, including Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) leaving the surrounding areas around Kyiv, according to the US intelligence. In the US view, this is not a short-term adjustment to regroup, but a longer-term move as Russia comes to grips with failure to advance in the north. The US assesses Russia will cover their retreat with air and artillery bombardment of the capital, one of the officials said. US officials caution that Russia could always reverse again if the battle conditions allow. Russia's suggestion of a reduction in its military action was met with cynicism in the West. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had not seen signs the talks between the two sides were ""moving forward in an effective way."" ""There is what Russia says, and there is what Russia does. We're focused on the latter,"" Blinken said. The UK agreed with those sentiments, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman saying on Tuesday that Britain will judge Russia by its actions rather than words and that they do not want to see anything less than a ""complete withdrawal"" of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory. Meanwhile, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu said ""consensus and common understanding"" was reached between the opposing delegations on some issues, hailing progress made in particular on the ""top priority of achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible to pave the way for a permanent political solution."" The ""trickier"" issues are now to be discussed at higher levels, with a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian Foreign Ministers to ""make final adjustments to the common approach,"" he said.",14,6.234859267367979,5.810632283204606,0.424226984163373,2
2022-03-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/ukraine-azov-movement-far-right-intl-cmd/index.html,A far-right battalion has a key role in Ukraine's resistance. Its neo-Nazi history has been exploited by Putin,"President Vladimir Putin framed the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a ""special mission"" to protect Russian speakers from genocide at the hands of ​""neo-Nazis."" In a speech broadcast minutes before the invasion began on February 24​, Putin said: ""We will seek to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine,"" ignoring the fact that the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is Jewish. For the Kremlin, Exhibit A in this special mission is the far-right Azov movement, part of the military and political landscape in Ukraine for nearly a decade. ​ Azov's military and political wings formally separated in 2016, when the far-right National Corps party was founded. The Azov battalion had by then been integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard. An effective fighting force that's very much involved in the current conflict, the battalion has a history of neo-Nazi leanings, which have not been entirely extinguished by its integration into the Ukrainian military. ​ In its heyday as an autonomous militia, the Azov Battalion was associated with White supremacists and neo-Nazi ideology and insignia. It was especially active in and around Mariupol in 2014 and 2015. CNN teams in the area at the time reported Azov's embrace of neo-Nazi emblems and paraphernalia. After its integration into the Ukrainian National Guard, amid discussions in the US Congress about designating the Azov Movement a foreign terrorist organization, Ukraine's then minister of internal affairs, Arsen Avakov, defended the unit. ""The shameful information campaign about the alleged spread of Nazi ideology (among Azov members) is a deliberate attempt to discredit the 'Azov' unit and the National Guard of Ukraine,"" he told the online newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda in 2019. The battalion still operates as a relatively autonomous entity. It has been prominent in defending Mariupol in recent weeks, and its resistance has been widely praised by members of the government. For Putin, who has falsely claimed Ukraine's government is run by ""drug addicts and neo-Nazis,"" Azov presents an obvious target. Moscow has given the regiment an outsized role in the conflict, routinely accusing it of human rights abuses. On March 7, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations blamed the Azov regiment for blocking an evacuation corridor in the besieged port city, saying they were using ""citizens as a human shield."" That claim has been repeated consistently in Russian media. The same day, Azov major Denis Prokopenko said in a video shared on the regiment's Twitter account that the ""attempts to organize a safe corridor for the (relocation) of civilian people... failed because of several actions of the enemy (Russian forces) in the assembly area."" After the bombing of a Mariupol theater that was sheltering civilians and had ""children"" written in Russian on the ground on either side of the building, the Russian Defense Ministry accused ""militants of the nationalist 'Azov' battalion"" of carrying out the attack. ​ In the Russian disinformation playbook, the Azov movement is a tempting target -- one where fact and disinformation can be elided. The existence of an identifiably Azov element within the Ukrainian armed forces -- and an effective element at that -- poses uncomfortable questions for the Ukrainian government and its Western allies, which continue to send arms to the country. CNN has reached out to ​Ukraine's defense ministry for comment. In the not-too-distant past, Azov's leadership openly espoused ​White supremacist views and cultivated links with similarly minded groups and individuals in the West. In 2010, Andriy Biletsky, now leader of the National Corps, the Azov movement's political wing, reportedly said his goal was to ""lead the White races of the world in a final crusade."" In a statement to CNN, the Azov regiment said it ""appreciates and respects Andriy Biletsky as the regiment's founder and first commander, but we have nothing to do with his political activities and the National Corps party"" -- adding the former commander never made such comments. The statement said that Azov's ""motivation has always angered Russia. Therefore, disinformation attacks on the AZOV Regiment have not stopped since 2014."" It added that the movement has ""repeatedly denied allegations of fascism, nazism and racism,"" and have Ukrainians of all different backgrounds including ""Greeks, Jews, Crimean Tatars, Russians"" who ""continue to serve in AZOV."" ""Most of them are Russian-speaking, most are Orthodox. But there are Catholics and Protestants, Pagans and those who profess Islam and Judaism, and there are atheists,"" Azov asserted. It noted that the Azov regiment's role is as ""a special unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, and is subordinated exclusively to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief -- the President of Ukraine, by the way, a Jew."" ""It would be absurd to think that we are united by the idea of white racism or nazism,"" the Azov statement added. Despite the Azov movement's international notoriety, Ukraine ""is not a cesspit for Nazi sympathizers,"" according to Alexander Ritzmann, a senior adviser at the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), based in Berlin. He noted that in the last elections in Ukraine in 2019, Azov's political wing only won 2.15% of the vote, and Biletsky lost his seat in parliament. Plus -- Ritzmann says -- there are far-right actors prominent in Russia, too. ""There is a far-right extremist problem on both sides in the conflict, but there seems to be a bias in only reporting on Ukraine's far-right problem,"" he said. Azov's beginnings The Azov Battalion was formed in 2014, the same year Russian-backed rebels began seizing territory across Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and Russia invaded and captured Crimea. At the time, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense encouraged volunteer battalions to join the resistance campaign and help its struggling army. The battalion's role in recapturing Mariupol in June 2014 from Russian-backed forces brought it ""hero status"" in Ukraine, said Ritzmann. But that status came with baggage -- the far-right views of some members and neo-Nazi insignia. These included the black sun, ""a pagan symbol appropriated by Nazis for their pseudo-religion,"" and the Wolfsangel, ""a symbol that far-right extremists have also adopted,"" Ritzmann said. Azov's leaders have denied the neo-Nazi associations, saying the Wolfsangel ""N"" and ""I' mean ""national idea."" Even though the Azov Battalion was co-founded by Biletsky, who previously led the radical right group Patriot of Ukraine, the group was armed by the state and partly funded by local oligarchs in eastern Ukraine. That funding included money from the Jewish tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, Ritzmann said. The US State Department sanctioned Kolomoisky in March 2021. The previous year, the US Justice Department placed him under investigation on accusations of embezzlement and fraud. ​ CNN has reached out to Kolomoisky's lawyer for comment. In 2016, the United National High Commissioner of Human Rights accused armed groups on both sides of the Donbas conflict, including Azov, of human rights abuses. International outreach When the Azov Battalion was brought under the command of the Ministry of Internal Affairs as a regiment in 2014, ""politically motivated fighters like (Andriy) Biletsky left and founded the Azov movement so they can do their ultra-nationalist, far-right work, which they were not allowed to do in the Ukrainian military,"" Ritzmann said. The political party Biletsky formed, the National Corps, which the US Department of State described in 2018 as a nationalist hate group, ""is essentially the spine of what we today call the Azov movement,"" Kacper Rekawek, a research fellow with the Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX) at the University of Oslo, told CNN. ""The Azov movement is a dangerous key player of the transnational extreme-right and has served as a network hub for several years now, with strong ties to far-right extremists in many European Union countries and the United States,"" Ritzmann said. Olena Semenyaka, the head of the National Corps' international department, attended a festival in 2018 organized by German neo-Nazis; and in 2019 she spoke at the far-right Scanza Forum in Sweden alongside British neo-Nazi Mark Collett. Since forming in 2014, the ​Azov movement has grown to include a militia, summer camps for kids and paramilitary training centers. It runs activities, including music festivals, political events and mixed-martial-arts tournaments, as it promoted itself in the international far-right space. The National Corps has repeatedly demonstrated its disdain for liberal values in its treatment of minority groups -- with few repercussions. A 2018 US State Department report found that the movement's militia ""attacked and destroyed a Romani camp in Kyiv after its residents failed to respond to their ultimatum to leave the area within 24 hours,"" in full view of the local police. The 'Death Star' While the far-right worldview of the Azov movement is clear, there has been an intense debate on whether the Azov Battalion should be classed a ""foreign terrorist organization"" by the US Department of State. ""People always assume it (the Azov regiment and Azov movement) is one Death Star,"" Rekawek said. ""Year by year, the connections (between the regiment and the movement) are looser,"" he said, explaining that the battalion's ranks now include Ukrainians who have no affinity with its neo-Nazi past. Ritzmann says the far-right element in Ukraine's army is no different to what's been detected in other militaries, such as in Germany and the US. ""Presumably, far-right extremists serve in the Ukrainian military as they do in all other militaries -- valid data regarding the exact numbers are not available,"" he said. ""Back in 2015, the Azov Regiment itself claimed to have between 10% and 20% far-right extremists in their ranks,"" but those figures are possibly smaller today, he said. But the regiment still uses the Wolfsangel symbol, and leaders of the Azov movement, who used to be commanders in the unit, continue to visit it, said Oleksiy Kuzmenko, a Ukrainian-American investigative journalist focusing on the Ukrainian far-right. ""The current leader of the Azov Regiment, Denis 'Redis' Prokopenko, is part of the core of the Azov movement since 2014, and served under commanders who went on to lead the Azov movement political and street wings,"" Kuzmenko told CNN. Prokopenko's deputy, Svyatoslav ""Kalyna"" Palamar, has explicitly praised the movement's founder, Biletsky, as ""a leader who 'finds sponsors that really invest money' into the regiment,"" Kuzmenko said. Kuzmenko points out that as of 2021, the regiment was ""actively involved in the training of the movement's youth leaders,"" and its website has a link to the movement's YouTube channel. ""Ukraine and (the) West's inaction on these issues paved the way for Putin",13,4.413595152581571,5.412726202639566,-0.9991310500579944,14
2022-03-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/politics/tod-wolters-intelligence-gap-us-russia-ukraine/index.html,Top US general in Europe says there 'could be' an intelligence gap in US that caused US to overestimate Russia's capabilities,"The top US general in Europe said Tuesday there ""could be"" a gap in US intelligence gathering that caused the US to overestimate Russia's capability and underestimate Ukraine's defensive abilities before Russia attacked Ukraine. When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last month, US intelligence assessed that the country-wide assault could lead to Kyiv falling into Russian hands within days. But Russia's military has been bogged down around the capital as the war has entered its second month, beleaguered by sustainability and logistics problems, along with an unexpected stiff resistance from Ukrainian fighters. Testifying at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday, US European Command chief Gen. Tod Wolters was asked by Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, if there was an intelligence gap that caused the US to overestimate Russia's strength and underestimate the Ukrainian defenses. ""There could be,"" Wolters responded. ""As we've always done in the past, when this crisis is over with, we will accomplish a comprehensive after-action review in all domains and in all departments and find out where our weak areas were and make sure we can find ways to improve, and this could be one of those areas."" While US intelligence was spot on in predicting Russia was planning to invade Ukraine -- which the Biden administration aggressively released to turn global sentiment against the Kremlin -- the intelligence community did not assess the poor performance of the Russian military. In the opening hours of the war, US officials offered to help Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky flee the country as Russian troops moved toward Kyiv, fearing that he would be killed. Zelensky refused, asking instead for weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. The US and NATO allies have continued to help re-supply Ukraine's military with weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that have been used against Russian forces. While estimates vary widely, sources familiar with the estimates say thousands of Russian troops have been killed in the conflict. US officials say they have anecdotal evidence of morale problems in the Russian military. More than a month into the war, Russia said on Tuesday that it would ""drastically reduce"" its military assault on the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv after talks took place between representatives of the two nations on Tuesday. US officials told CNN it was a ""major"" strategy shift by Moscow, with Russian forces pulling back in some areas of the north and focusing on gains in the south and east. At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing earlier this month, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said that the US intelligence community assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was underestimating the likely resistance he would face from the Ukrainians ahead of the invasion."" ""I think we did well there,"" she said. ""We did not do as well in terms of predicting the military challenges that he has encountered with his own military."" Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that US intelligence assessments before the invasion were based on a number of factors, including that the Ukrainians were ""not as ready as I thought they should be."" ""Therefore, I questioned their will to fight. That was a bad assessment on my part, because they have fought bravely and honorably and are doing the right thing,"" he said. Asked by Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton about assessments on how long Kyiv would hold out or how long Ukraine could maintain its air defenses, Berrier said the intelligence community ""made some assumptions about (Putin's) assumptions, which proved to be very, very flawed."" ""His actual activity as he got into this fight turned his operation kind of on its head,"" Berrier said of Putin. ""And what we've seen is a devolvement, if you will, of the operations that he has going on now.""",14,5.61372058325642,5.5423543402141116,0.07136624304230832,12
2022-03-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/28/europe/mariupol-mayor-ukraine-occupiers-intl/index.html,Mariupol evacuation corridors 'in the hands of the occupiers' as mayor tells everyone to leave,"Ukrainian forces ""continue to maintain circular defense"" in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the Ukrainian general staff said early Tuesday, even as Russian forces consolidated control around the southeastern port city. On Monday, the mayor of Mariupol said that evacuation corridors had come largely under the control of Russian forces, after weeks of bombardment left the city in pieces, killed an unknown number of civilians and forced hundreds of thousands of residents from their homes. ""Not everything is in our power,"" said Mayor Vadym Boichenko, in a live television interview. ""Unfortunately, we are in the hands of the occupiers today."" Boichenko called for a complete evacuation of the remaining population of Mariupol, which was home to more than 400,000 people before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24. ""According to our estimates, about 160,000 people are in the besieged city of Mariupol today, where it is impossible to live because there is no water, no electricity, no heat, no connection,"" he said. ""And it's really scary."" It was unclear if there was still active fighting inside the city. Ukrainian officials have alleged that Russian forces have prevented humanitarian convoys from safely approaching or exiting the city. A pro-Russian separatist leader said on Sunday that about 1,700 Mariupol residents were being ""evacuated"" daily from the city and its surroundings. Ukrainian officials, however, say thousands were being forcibly ""deported"" to Russia. ""We need a complete evacuation from Mariupol,"" Boichenko said. ""Our most important mission today is to save every life ... And there are hopes that we will succeed. For example, there are 26 buses that have to go to Mariupol to evacuate, but unfortunately, they haven't received permission to move,"" he said. ""And this game is played every day. A cynical game like, 'Yes, we are ready. You can drive there,' but in fact it does not work,"" he said. ""Our heroic drivers under the fire are trying to reach the places where Mariupol residents can be picked up, and they are waiting with the hope that they will have such an opportunity. But the Russian Federation has been playing with us since day one."" Statistics released by Ukrainian officials on Sunday paint a grim picture of what has come from weeks of shelling and urban combat in Mariupol. Some 90% of residential buildings in the city were damaged, the data shows. Of those, 60% were hit directly and 40% were destroyed. Seven of the city's hospitals -- 90% of the city's hospital capacity -- were damaged, of which three were destroyed. Also damaged were three maternity hospitals (one destroyed), seven institutes of higher education (three destroyed), and 57 schools and 70 kindergartens, with 23 and 28 destroyed, respectively. A number of factories were damaged and the city's port sustained damage. According to those official statistics, up to 140,000 people left the city before it was surrounded, and around 150,000 managed to leave during the blockade. Ukrainian officials claim 30,000 people from Mariupol were deported to Russia.",17,5.83088719119699,4.600359323812076,1.2305278673849145,1
2022-03-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/28/europe/russian-scientists-collaboration-scn/index.html,Scientific collaboration with Russia begins to unravel,"Russian scientists are finding themselves isolated as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its second month. The country's Mars rover project with the European Space Agency is on hold. Russian institutions have been suspended from CERN, the world's largest particle physics lab, in Switzerland. A prestigious math conference has been moved from St. Petersburg to a virtual meeting, and Russian scientific journals are being frozen out of key international databases. High-profile scientific journals such as Science and Nature aren't rejecting research submitted by Russian scientists, but financial sanctions placed on Russia may make paying journal processing fees tricky. Ukrainian researchers are calling for a complete boycott of Russian institutions and academics. But while welcoming the outpouring of support across the West for Ukrainian scientists, some academics think that shunning all Russian scientists could be counterproductive. ""Shutting down all interaction with Russian scientists would be a serious setback to a variety of Western and global interests and values, which include making rapid progress on global challenges related to science and technology, maintaining non-ideological lines of communication across national boundaries, and opposing ideological stereotyping and indiscriminate persecution,"" said a letter published Thursday in the journal Science authored by five prominent scientists from the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. John Holdren, a research professor in environmental science and policy at Harvard Kennedy School and the science adviser to former US President Barack Obama, was one of the authors. He said he wanted to make sure there was balance in the measures taken to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime. ""I put a very high value on cooperation in science and technology, "" Holdren said. ""My colleagues and I who wrote that letter together were alarmed by reports that what was underway was a wholesale demonization and isolation of Russian scientists."" 'Deep regret' Germany has taken one of the swiftest and strongest stances. On February 25, the Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany recommended that all academic cooperation with state institutions and business enterprises in Russia be frozen with immediate effect and German research funds no longer benefit Russia. A German-built space telescope making the largest map of black holes in the universe has been switched off. The black hole-hunting telescope, called eROSITA, short for extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array, launched in 2019 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma satellite, a joint Russian-German science mission supported by Roscosmos, the Russian space agency. The DFG or German Research Foundation, which had funded more than 300 German-Russian research projects with a total volume of over 110 million euros over the past three years, suspended all its research projects with Russia. Scientific publisher Clarivate said earlier in March it had has ceased all commercial activity in Russia, closing its office there. Its influential Web of Science publication database won't include new journals based in Russia or Belarus, which has supported the Russian invasion. The database tracks citations -- a key yardstick of scientific success -- that helps scientists get noticed. In the United States, MIT has ended the relationship it had with the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) in Moscow, although it stressed that it was proud of the research the collaboration had produced over the past decade. ""This step is a rejection of the actions of the Russian government in Ukraine. We take it with deep regret because of our great respect for the Russian people and our profound appreciation for the contributions of the many extraordinary Russian colleagues we have worked with."" Nature, a leading UK publisher of scientific journals, said that calls for a comprehensive and worldwide boycott of all Russian research, and for scientific journals to refuse to consider papers by researchers from Russia were ""understandable."" But it said that it will continue to consider manuscripts from all over the world. ""That is because we think at this time that such a boycott would do more harm than good. It would divide the global research community and restrict the exchange of scholarly knowledge -- both of which have the potential to damage the health and well-being of humanity and the planet."" NASA has said it's still working closely with the Russian space agency on the International Space Station despite the mounting political tensions. On Wednesday, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is set to return to Earth alongside Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov. Possible long-term repercussions Science has long been a cross-border endeavor, and many Russian scientists have close ties with their counterparts in the United States and Europe. Mikhail Gelfand, a Russian professor who studies comparative genomics and molecular evolution, is one of them. Gelfand said that so far his day-to-day work has not been affected, but he said that he expected some of his experiments to be stalled because international sanctions would make it hard to get hold of some lab supplies. He also said he was spending a lot more time writing letters of recommendation for colleagues and students trying to leave Russia. A complete boycott of Russian scientists and institutions would be unfair, he said. ""Unlike other actions, this will not influence the war; this will help the oppressive regime to get tighter hold on what is still alive in Russia; and it will punish mainly the people who oppose the war,"" Gelfand said. Gelfand helped organize a letter against the war that he said was signed by more than 8,000 Russian scientists. It has since been blocked online by Russian authorities, he said. In the letter to Science, Holdren and his colleagues said that while government-to-government collaboration was ""understandably on hold,"" they stressed that ""not all engagement with Russian scientists should be."" Climate change and the Arctic were two areas were Russian scientific efforts were particularly important, Holdren said. They also noted that many thousands of Russian academics and students ""live and work in the West,"" according to the letter, and many have been critical of the Russian government. ""Surely these Russians should not be lumped together with leaders of the Russian state. Rather, humanitarian provision should be made to ensure that, as their visas and passports expire, they are not forcibly repatriated to face not only isolation from their Western colleagues but also, very possibly, persecution,"" they wrote. ""Decisions made in Western countries today about how to deal with Russia and Russians may be in place for a long time and, ultimately, difficult to reverse. We fervently hope that all future decisions about Russian scientists and Russian academic institutions will reflect a balanced appraisal.""",3,5.59463344435551,4.867748166698893,0.726885277656617,11
2022-03-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/28/politics/lviv-ukraine-russian-invasion-what-matters/index.html,'This invasion is horrifying': What it's like on the ground in Lviv following Russian missile attacks,"At least five people were reportedly injured over the weekend after at least two missiles struck Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that had been previously spared the worst of Russia's brutal onslaught, local officials said. One of the strikes hit a fuel storage facility, causing it to catch fire, and a later strike caused ""significant damage"" to the city's infrastructure facilities, according to the city's mayor, Andriy Sadovyi. For a better sense of the situation on the ground, we posed a few questions to CNN's John Berman, who's been covering the invasion from Lviv. His responses, sent via email on Sunday, are below: WHAT MATTERS: Can you describe how people in Lviv are behaving at this moment? BERMAN: We went out to one of the main squares today, less than 24 hours after a series of Russian missile strikes, and it was packed. So many people out enjoying the beautiful weather and street music and food. It was astounding. Their reasons for being there were twofold. Some people told us it was their way of showing Putin that they can't be intimidated. But the majority of people we spoke with were actually from different parts of the country, and, frankly, they have seen worse. So the missile strikes here did not scare them, at least not as much as the things they have lived through in Kharkiv or Sumy or Kyiv. WHAT MATTERS: What are locals telling you about their future plans in the face of such uncertainty? BERMAN: When you ask about the future, every Ukrainian we have spoken with tells us that their plans are to resist, to fight and to win. There is nothing else. There are different ways of doing this, and some have made sure the vulnerable family members are out of the country. But Ukrainians really see only one way through this. WHAT MATTERS: You spent time in a Ukrainian children's hospital; can you describe what you saw? BERMAN: We met 15-year-old Andriy at a children's hospital. He is from Chernihiv, which has been brutalized by the Russians. He was forced from his home at gunpoint, and then later in a car drove over what he described as a land mine. He injured both legs and his collarbone. His mother died in the blast. The last time he saw her, she was still alive, and on fire. It is horrifying to write those words. But this invasion is horrifying. You can't look at Andriy and what he has lost and stomach any arguments that there are somehow two moral sides to this conflict. Only Ukrainian children are losing their mothers. Only Ukrainian children are being blasted by land mines. Every political and diplomatic discussion anyone has needs to begin by acknowledging this point. And on a personal level, it is just heartbreaking. Weekend speed read Biden's (off-the-cuff) declaration. President Joe Biden said forcefully Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power,"" but the White House said afterward that it was not a call for regime change. ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden announced at the very conclusion of a capstone address delivered at the Royal Castle in Warsaw. ""The President's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or regime change,"" a White House official said later. Volodymyr Zelensky's plea. The Ukrainian President this weekend reiterated his plea for international partners to step up their military assistance, saying his country asks for only 1% of NATO's tanks and planes. In a video message posted to social media, Zelensky said the need to strengthen common security in Europe was raised during his two conversations with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Saturday. Zelensky lamented that Ukraine has been waiting for 31 days for this assistance, saying it raises the question of who exactly ""is ruling the Euro-Atlantic Alliance."" He called on Ukraine's international partners to ""rally and activate their support"" for the country, stressing that Europe's safety and security hinge on it. All eyes on new round of talks. The next round of talks between Russia and Ukraine will be in the Turkish city of Istanbul on Tuesday, according to the Turkish presidency.

""All businesses, all critical infrastructure owners and operators need to assume that disruptive cyber activity is something that the Russians are thinking about, that are preparing for, that are exploring options, as the President said,"" Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Pamela Brown. ""That's why we are so focused on making sure that everybody understands the potential for this disruptive cyber activity,"" Easterly said. ""And it's not about panic. It's about preparation."" Easterly pointed to the example of a cybercriminal attack on Colonial Pipeline last year, which shut down delivery of fuel to the East Coast for days and led to Americans hoarding gasoline. The Biden administration has for months warned that Moscow could respond to US sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine with cyberattacks on US infrastructure — or that ransomware gangs like the one that hit Colonial Pipeline could lash out. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming,"" President Joe Biden told business leaders March 21. Easterly called Biden's statement, which said Russia was conducting ""preparatory activity"" for a potential cyberattack, ""pretty unprecedented."" ""I think what makes the moment different is just seeing what the Russians have done with this unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and then understanding there can be some very real consequences of that in cyberspace,"" Easterly told CNN. Easterly's agency, established in 2018, is charged with advising the owners and operators of power plants, manufacturing facilities and other critical infrastructure on how to defend against such threats. Agencies like CISA and the departments of Treasury and Energy have in recent months held cyberthreat briefings on Russian hacking capabilities for America's biggest banks and electric utilities. Many of those critical infrastructure operators have spent years investing in network defense and studying high-profile Russian cyberattacks like one that cut power in Ukraine for a quarter million people. A month into the war in Ukraine, the Russian military has stumbled and still failed to take the capital of Kyiv. ""I would imagine that there is a lot of pressure, a lot of stress on not just the Russian military but against the Russian intelligence officers,"" said Easterly, a former US Army intelligence officer.",3,6.074329800604423,8.132935031987902,-2.0586052313834786,23
2022-03-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-new-phase-intl-cmd/index.html,Ukrainians disrupt and derail Russian offensive as war moves to new phase,"Just over a month after the first ballistic missiles slammed into Kyiv's international airport, the Russian campaign has been disrupted and derailed by stubborn Ukrainian resistance -- and in the last few days by agile Ukrainian counterattacks on several fronts. Russian forces retain considerable -- but not overwhelming -- numerical superiority. Their armored groups have struggled against Western-supplied anti-tank weapons and Turkish-made drones. Ukrainian air defenses have punched above their weight and are now being reinforced by thousands of US-made Stinger missiles. Poor logistical support, questionable tactics and growing evidence of poor morale among Russian battalion tactical groups have allowed the Ukrainian military to hold off Russian advances in several regions -- and begin to take the fight to the enemy. CNN analysis of satellite imagery, social media content and official statements from both sides suggests the conflict may now be moving into a new phase: a war of attrition in which the Russians may lose more ground than they gain and suffer even greater resupply issues as the Ukrainians cut into their extended lines. There are indications that the Russian military is trying to compensate for this by greater use of missile forces and indirect fire from artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. To the north and west of Kyiv, for example, the Russians appear to be digging in rather than seeking to advance, shelling areas like Irpin and Makariv, where Ukrainian troops have established a tenuous hold. In the last two weeks, there's been an uptick in Russian missile strikes, from Lviv in the west to Zhytomyr in central Ukraine and Mykolaiv in the south, with prime targets being fuel dumps, military depots and airfields. Ukraine goes on the attack The Ukrainians have been mostly circumspect about going on the offensive, but on Friday National Security Adviser Oleksiy Danilov said: ""We are going on the counterattack in some areas, and this counterattack is absolutely productive."" These fightbacks are limited and focused but include fronts in the south, central Ukraine and the northeast. The Institute for the Study of War, in its latest assessment, describes them as ""prudent and effective, allowing Ukrainian forces to regain small areas of tactically or operationally significant terrain without overextending themselves."" The south The push towards the Russian-occupied city of Kherson is perhaps the most ambitious. After resisting attempts by Russian forces to take Mykolaiv -- a bridgehead for assaulting Odesa -- the Ukrainians launched devastating missile attacks against the Russian command at Kherson's airport (killing a Russian general in the process, they say) and gained ground to the north of the city. This as civil disobedience in the city has frayed the nerves of Russian troops. On Sunday, a large crowd took to the streets of Kakhovka -- east of Kherson -- to protest Russian occupation. A local journalist, Oleh Baturin, told CNN that Russian forces still controlled the area. Kakhovka matters because it's close to a bridge linking Kherson with points east. A Russian land corridor linking Crimea with its border would be hard to sustain without that access. Baturin said there was heavy fighting near the nearby town of Tavriysk and Nova Kakhovka, where there was a large concentration of Russian forces. How this battle evolves could have a major bearing on the Russian campaign in the south. The northeast Perhaps surprisingly, Ukrainian units have also gained territory close to the Russian border, around the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. Kharkiv, just 30 miles from the Russian border, has been under almost constant attack since the first day of the invasion but remains in Ukrainian hands. Ukrainian forces now appear to have retaken some outlying areas. Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration, claimed Saturday that ""several settlements were liberated"" east of the city. A long video analyzed by CNN showed an assault by troops of the ultra-nationalist Azov Battalion on a village near Kharkiv in which they took a number of Russian prisoners, some of them apparently badly wounded. Other videos showed a string of villages south of Kharkiv now in Ukrainian hands. Russian forces continue a weeks-long attempt to take Izium, to the south of Kharkiv, but Ukrainian resistance continues in the heavily damaged city. A local official, Maksym Strelnyk, said Sunday that ""currently, the situation in Izium is extremely complicated. Fierce fighting continues."" Still in the northeast, CNN has geo-located video and images showing Ukrainian forces back in control of the town of Trostyanets, some 30 miles from the city of Sumy, with Russian armor including a T-80 tank and infantry fighting vehicles damaged and abandoned. The Ukrainian 93rd Brigade posted images on its Facebook account showing its soldiers in Trostyanets, and said the Russians had fled -- ""leaving behind weapons, equipment and ammunition."" Near Kyiv Just east of Kyiv the last few days have seen Ukrainian gains in a largely rural area some 40 miles (70 kms) from the capital, around the villages of Lukyanivka and Rudnytske. If sustained, these gains could complicate an already long Russian supply chain and even cut off forward Russian units. It's not all one-way traffic. The city of Chernihiv north of Kyiv is still surrounded by Russian forces, which have also entered the nearby city of Slavutych this weekend. Social media videos showed them in control of the center of the city, using stun grenades and bursts of automatic fire into the air as a crowd of several hundred Ukrainian civilians protested. And the Russians retain the ability to shell the outskirts of Kyiv from the north. Moscow's shifting language As their ground campaign falters, Russian officials have asserted that encircling Ukrainian cities actually serves an ulterior goal: to pin down Ukrainian forces and prevent them from focusing on the separatist regions of Donbas. Colonel General Sergei Rudskoy, first deputy chief of Russia's General Staff, said Friday that laying siege to Ukrainian cities and damaging military infrastructure ""allow us not only to tie down their forces and prevent them from strengthening their grouping in the Donbas."" In announcing the special military operation on February 24, President Vladimir Putin said it was aimed at securing Donbas -- the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk -- from an alleged Ukrainian assault. Rudskoy appeared to reference that, saying, ""In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed."" The Russian intention was never to storm Ukrainian cities, he insisted, adding that while the possibility was not excluded ""our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing -- the complete liberation of Donbas."" But Rudskoy also referred to a more ambitious goal of Putin, the so-called ""demilitarization and denazification"" of Ukraine. The available evidence suggests Russian forces are edging forward on the fringes of Donbas. But a significant component of those forces has been itself tied down in the grueling siege of Mariupol. Losses there will affect their ability to project force elsewhere in the southeast. The Institute for the Study of War said Rudskoy's comments ""could indicate that Russia has scaled back its aims and would now be satisfied with controlling the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, but that reading is likely inaccurate."" The ISW says: ""The absence of significant Russian offensive operations throughout most of Ukraine likely reflects the inability of the Russian military to generate sufficient combat power to attack rather than any decision in Moscow to change Russia's war aims or concentrate on the east."" The Ukrainian armed forces command appears unconvinced too, saying that Russian units are reorganizing and consolidating to replace combat losses. All of which suggests a second and possibly still bloodier phase of the conflict is about to begin, as Russia tries to reinvigorate a faltering campaign on the ground while doubling down on its use of cruise and ballistic missiles.",14,6.318813942378583,2.999888448367933,3.31892549401065,21
2022-03-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/26/europe/lviv-ukraine-attack-saturday-intl/index.html,"Lviv, western Ukrainian city until now spared from Russian assault, rocked by powerful explosions","At least five people were reportedly injured Saturday after at least two missiles struck Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that had been previously spared the worst of Russia's brutal onslaught, local officials said. One of the strikes hit a fuel storage facility, causing it to catch fire, and a later strike caused ""significant damage"" to the city's infrastructure facilities, according to the city's mayor, Andriy Sadovyi. Three powerful blasts were heard in the center of the city earlier, and plumes of thick black smoke could be seen rising in the distance. Air raid sirens rang out prior to the explosions. Maksym Kozytsky, the head of the Lviv regional military administration, later on his Telegram account reported three more explosions following the strike on the fuel depot, saying, ""The air alarm remains."" Lviv is a strategic Ukrainian city close to the Polish border that has largely been spared from the relentless bombardment seen across much of the country during the Russian invasion. It was a surprising attack, coming just a day after the Russian military said that the first phase of the conflict had ended and that it was shifting its attention to the disputed eastern parts of Ukraine. The Russian military on Sunday confirmed strikes on fuel depots on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and outside of Kyiv, saying it had targeted fuel supplies for Ukrainian troops. In a briefing Sunday, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Igor Konashenkov also confirmed a separate strike on Lviv Saturday, saying cruise missiles had targeted the workshops of the Lviv radio repair plant, which he claimed carried out the overhaul and modernization of Ukrainian weapons systems. Separately, Konashenkov claimed that sea-launched weapons had targeted a Ukrainian missile storage facility 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv. Sadovyi said in an update on Twitter Sunday that it took firefighters 14 hours to put out the fire. The attack came as US President Joe Biden was in Poland Saturday, where he met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, as well as Ukrainian officials and refugees. Biden later delivered a speech outside the Royal Castle in the Polish capital of Warsaw, in which he declared forcefully that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power."" The White House afterward said Biden wasn't calling for regime change: ""The President's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,"" a White House official said. Earlier in the speech, Biden told the Ukrainian people: ""We stand with you. Period."" Biden was briefed on the strike on Lviv before leaving his hotel for his speech, according to a White House official. ""Now in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom, Ukraine and its people are on the front lines, fighting to save their nation, and their brave resistance is part of a larger fight for ... essential democratic principles that unite all free people,"" Biden said. Sadovyi initially said on Twitter Saturday that Russian troops had attacked the city but did not provide extensive detail. He urged residents to stay in shelters. An industrial facility in Lviv used for fuel storage was burned as a result of one of the Russian strikes, according to Sadovyi. ""As a result of the shelling, one of the industrial facilities burns. It is fuel storage,"" the mayor said. He did not clarify if this was the cause of the smoke. The mayor added that ""habitable infrastructure was not injured."" Sadovyi later confirmed that another strike had hit Lviv, causing ""significant damage"" to the city's infrastructure. Residential buildings were not damaged, he added. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities said Saturday that bus convoys trying to evacuate civilians were being stopped and held by Russian forces, as part of what they claimed to be a pressure campaign to force some residents to go to Russia. In a statement, Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional administration, said an evacuation convoy of more than 50 buses driving from the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia was held overnight at a Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka, about 35 miles south of Zaporizhzhia. Starukh said the convoy included two ambulances carrying three children requiring urgent medical care. Saturday's strikes were not the first strikes on Lviv. Several Russian missiles hit an aircraft repair plant there on March 18. Work at the facility had stopped before the strikes, and there were no reports of casualties. Saturday's attacks come after a top Russian general claimed Friday that the ""first stage"" of Russia's military plan was complete, with their primary focus now centered on eastern Ukraine. It was unclear if the statement implied a shifting of the goalposts for the Russian military or just represents a change in public messaging. ""In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed,"" said Col. General Sergei Rudskoy, first deputy chief of Russia's General Staff, in a briefing. ""The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been significantly reduced, allowing us, I emphasize again, to focus the main efforts on achieving the main goal - the liberation of Donbas."" After days of Western leaders displaying their united front against Russia, Saturday's strikes could be seen as a response from Putin and his military to Biden and the West. The Russian military has claimed it is not targeting civilians or residential areas, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.",17,2.510849075387544,3.9256487346410736,-1.4147996592535295,10

""In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed,"" Colonel General Sergei Rudskoy, first deputy chief of Russia's General Staff, said in a Friday briefing. ""The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been significantly reduced, allowing us, I emphasize again, to focus the main efforts on achieving the main goal - the liberation of Donbas."" Rudskoy's remarks come as Russia's advances appear to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. Russia has also failed to achieve air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses of personnel since the start of the invasion. ""The public and individual experts are wondering what we are doing in the area of ​​the blockaded Ukrainian cities,"" Rudskoy said. ""These actions are carried out with the aim of causing such damage to military infrastructure, equipment, personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the results of which allow us not only to tie down their forces and prevent them from strengthening their grouping in the Donbas, but also will not allow them to do this until the Russian army completely liberates the territories of the DPR and LNR."" Rudskoy was referring to the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, separatist territories in eastern Ukraine that Russia recognized on the eve of its invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that the goal of what Russian officials refer to euphemistically as the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is the complete demilitarization of the country. Putin has said the war is going according to plan, but Russian forces have incurred serious losses: Rudskoy said in the same briefing that 1,351 military personnel had been killed in Ukraine and 3,825 had been wounded. US, NATO and Ukrainian officials estimate the Russian casualty count is much higher. ""Initially, we did not plan to storm them in order to prevent destruction and minimize losses among personnel and civilians,"" Rudskoy said. ""And although we do not exclude such a possibility, however, as individual groupings complete the tasks set, and they are successfully solved, our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing -- the complete liberation of Donbas."" It is unclear if Rudskoy's statement implies a shifting of the goalposts for the Russian military, or just represents a change in public messaging.

2022-03-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/25/europe/chemical-weapons-fears-russia-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Where have chemical weapons been used, and are they really a red line for the West?","US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that NATO would respond if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, and has previously warned that Moscow would ""pay a severe price"" if it did so. The use of such weapons against Ukrainian people would mark a dramatic escalation to Russia's invasion, and would likely demand heavy retaliation from the West. But concerns have been growing that Russia may be planning to take the step, after the Kremlin planted the unsubstantiated idea that Ukraine and the US may use these weapons. ""It's a tell that they themselves may be preparing to do so, and then trying to pin the blame on someone else,"" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier this month. Why would their use be so significant? Chemical weapons contain toxic substances designed to cause death or harm to their targets. They can spread dangerous chemicals including choking, blister and nerve agents, which can attack the body and cause death on a vast scale, indiscriminately and across a wide area if they are deployed inside a bomb or an artillery shell. Their use is banned by international law. Russia has signed those treaties and claims it doesn't have chemical weapons, but the country has already been linked to the use of nerve agents against critics in recent years. Those cases include the poisonings of Sergei Skripal and Alexey Navalny. Their prohibition stems from a painful history. The use of chemical agents including chlorine, phosgene and mustard gas was one of the horrors of World War I and was responsible for nearly 100,000 deaths, according to the United Nations. In response, the Geneva Protocol, which banned chemical weapons attacks, was drawn up and signed in 1925. Nonetheless, as many as 25 countries worked to develop chemical weapons during the Cold War, according to the United Nations' Office for Disarmament Affairs. Lengthy negotiations eventually led to the adoption of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which entered into force in 1997, requiring nations to destroy their stockpiles and prohibiting the development, production or use of chemical weapons. There have, however, been limited occasions in which they have been used in combat -- and those occasions have led to political fallout around the world. Former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein used a variety of chemical weapons against Iran during the 1980s, and their use in Syria over the past decade brought the threat of US intervention in that country's civil war. Attacks in Ghouta in 2013 and in Khan Sheikhoun in 2017 both involved the alleged use of sarin gas, a nerve agent banned under the CWC. In 2013, the use of the gas, reported by United Nations investigators, crossed one of then-President Barack Obama's self-declared red lines -- yet no military action came. Instead, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) went into Syria to monitor the destruction of the country's chemical weapons program. Warnings to Russia While Biden's declaration may conjure memories of Obama's ill-fated ""red line"" warning in 2013, the current US President has a united NATO on his side. On Thursday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance would reinforce its chemical, biological and nuclear defense systems amid fears over Russia's intentions. In a joint statement Thursday, the leaders of the G7 warned Russia against the use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. ""Any Russian use of chemical or biological weapons ""would be a breach of all rules, all agreements and all existing conventions,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz added. ""We can only say: Don't do it!""",3,4.380071771946346,7.526872420549402,-3.1468006486030564,27
2022-03-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/25/europe/ukraine-mariupol-theater-dead-intl/index.html,"300 people were killed in Russian airstrike on Mariupol theater, Ukrainian authorities say","About 300 people are believed to have died in a Russian attack on a theater in Mariupol nine days ago, the city council has said, citing eyewitness reports. The March 16 bombing of Mariupol's Drama Theater, where Ukrainian officials say up to 1,300 had sought refuge, was among the most brazen of Russia's attacks on civilians since its invasion began in late February. Painted on the ground outside the building -- in giant Russian letters -- was the word ""CHILDREN."" The message -- large enough to be viewed from the sky -- was scrawled near a public square. Russia has denied its forces hit the theater, claiming instead that the Azov battalion, the Ukrainian army's main presence in Mariupol, blew it up. Announcing the update on its Telegram channel, the city council said: ""Unfortunately, we start the day with bad news. There is information, based on eyewitnesses, that about 300 people died in the Drama Theater in Mariupol as a result of a bombing by Russian aircraft. ""We still do not want to believe in this horror. We still want to believe that everyone managed to escape. But the words of those who were inside the building at the time of this terrorist act say otherwise."" CNN has been unable to independently verify the death toll. Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor said on Telegraph that about 600 people are believed to have survived the attack. He added that many of those who survived were in the process of making their way out of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. ""The occupier knew where he was hitting. He knew what the consequences might be, and anyway the bombs fell on this place,"" the city council statement Friday said. Video of the aftermath of the bombing, which emerged recently on social media, shows people making their escape from the dusty and debris strewn building. Holes in the walls can be seen as people make their way down a staircase to leave the theater. ""The missile hit right in the center of the Drama Theater,"" a man's voice can be heard saying. In a second video, which shows massive internal structural damage to the building, a man's voice offers reassurance that he and others with him on the ground floor of the building were not injured in the attack. But he expresses fears that many others who were sheltering in the building remain buried under the rubble. Breakdown of essential services The theater was being used as one of the main shelters in Mariupol, which has been under intense bombardment since the early days of Russia's assault on Ukraine. Information about the full extent of the attack has been slow to emerge due to the almost complete breakdown of essential services in the city, including communication networks. The coastal city has been under siege for several weeks and has seen some of the worst attacks in the war since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February. There is still no word on possible casualties after a separate attack on an art school building that was also being used as a shelter by up to 400 people. Basic services like gas, electricity and water, are all out in the city. Bodies are being left in the street because there is either no one left to collect them, or it is simply too dangerous to try. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced two evacuation corridors for Mariupol and occupied Melitopol on Friday. Speaking in a televised message, Vereshchuk said the corridors will link the two cities with Zaporizhzhia, which lies to the north and is still in Ukrainian hands. Over the last week, Russian forces have been deporting thousands of Mariupol residents against their will to far-flung cities in Russia, according to city officials and witnesses. And on Monday, Moscow called on Mariupol to surrender -- a notion Ukraine swiftly shot down. Russia has denied targeting civilians in Mariupol, blaming casualties on Ukrainian forces. Andriushchenko told CNN on Sunday that the battle for the city has made it impossible to retrieve and identify the dead, or treat the wounded. In a video message posted to Facebook in the early hours of Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the siege of Mariupol would go down in history as a war crime. ""To do this to a peaceful city ... is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,"" he added.",17,8.426949514425129,3.612822541575104,4.814126972850024,1
2022-03-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/25/politics/poland-biden-trip-ukraine-war-analysis/index.html,Here's why Biden is going to Poland,"If there's one nation that understands Ukraine's torment, it's Poland, which welcomes President Joe Biden on Friday as part of his emergency mission to shore up NATO's defenses following Russia's brutal invasion. In the United States, Biden's warnings that democracy is under siege from menacing autocrats can seem remote, even after former President Donald Trump's US Capitol insurrection and attempt to steal the 2020 election. But in Poland, which neighbors Ukraine, freedom is fresh enough to still be a novelty. In a tortured 20th-century history, the country -- torn between East and West -- was repeatedly conquered, was ruled by foreign tyrants and saw millions of its people purged or driven as refugees from homes destroyed by warfare. Poland again finds itself on the front line of conflict. It's on the dividing line between states in the NATO club, to which it now belongs, and President Vladimir Putin's Russian orbit, which includes another Polish neighbor, Belarus. Poland has opened its borders to more than 2 million of the 3.7 million Ukrainians who have fled Putin's onslaught, and the war came close to its borders with a Russian strike on a base in western Ukraine earlier this month. Like Ukraine, Poland lived for decades under Moscow's Communist iron fist. Like Ukrainians, Poles are often gritty, are deeply suspicious of Russians and have fighting for their freedom and sovereignty ingrained in their DNA. Unlike Ukraine, one of the founding republics of the Soviet Union, Poland made it to the West after decades under the Warsaw Pact umbrella. And in addition to being in NATO, it's a member of the European Union, albeit one that has had tensions recently with Brussels over its own flirtations with populist nationalism. As Putin's threat mounted in recent years, Poland hosted rotations of US troops and jets. In February, before Putin invaded Ukraine, Poland was one of the nations to which Biden ordered 3,000 troops to bolster the alliance's eastern flank. If the war in Ukraine spills over into a broader conflict between Russia and the West, a frightening prospect, there's a good chance it could happen in Poland. ""We feel that it is the right place for (Biden) to go to be able to see troops, to be able to see humanitarian experts, and to be able to meet with a frontline and very vulnerable ally,"" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said this week. Biden's trip comes several weeks after Vice President Kamala Harris was in Warsaw and helped ease a disagreement between the two governments about Poland's plan to send Soviet-era jets to Ukraine. Biden opposed the transfer, reasoning that it could be seen by Putin as an escalation of the conflict that could create a cascade of consequences and a showdown between the West and Russia, which would risk a nuclear exchange. Deep ties with Washington Americans and American presidents are popular in Poland -- a legacy of strong US support for the dissident Solidarity movement, which was nurtured in the shipyards of the northern city of Gdansk and created some of the first cracks in the Soviet Empire, with the support of the Polish Pope, John Paul II. Ronald Reagan, the American President mostly credited with winning the Cold War, was revered in Poland. And his successors have often found a warm welcome on European tours. Poland, conscious of its debt to the US and keen to build stronger ties to the West, sent troops to America's early 21st-century wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- even as many of Washington's older allies balked at joining the latter conflict. Over the next two days, Biden will meet Polish President Andrzej Duda and is expected to visit US forces sent to bolster Poland's defenses. Biden will visit some of the thousands of Ukrainian refugees in the country to shine a spotlight on the grave humanitarian crisis unleashed by Putin that is straining health and government services in Eastern Europe. Biden, who announced Thursday that the US would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, hinted after a NATO summit that he would meet some of the throngs of people who have fled Putin's civilian bombardments in Ukraine and his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Friday that Biden will meet with Ukrainian refugees and deliver a ""major address"" in Warsaw on Saturday. Ahead of that possible visit, the President reflected on refugees whom he had met in camps elsewhere in the world over the years. ""You see children that are without parents in those camps ... men and women who are completely lost ... and you see that blank look on their face, that absolute feeling of 'My God, where am I?'"" Biden said. Poland is used to being a presidential metaphor US presidents have long seen Poland as an exemplar of freedoms that NATO was set up to safeguard and have lauded its long and successful battle for its own existence -- a struggle that Ukraine is now waging. Poland was eviscerated in the middle of the 20th century when almost all of its substantial Jewish population was murdered in the Holocaust. The preserved camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, west of the southern city of Krakow, stand as a haunting memorial to the horrors of the Nazi occupation. The fall of the Third Reich didn't, however, bring liberation. Poland then endured nearly half a century of Communist repression imposed by Russia. In 2003, in Krakow, President George W. Bush lauded the eastward expansion of NATO, which has so irked Putin, saying it had brought ""the peace and security of our alliance to the young democracies of Europe."" At the time, however, Bush was more preoccupied with the twin wars in Afghanistan and Iraq launched after the September 11, 2001, attacks than a revived showdown with Moscow. In 2014, marking the 25th anniversary of an election that started a process that led to the downfall of Communist rulers in Warsaw, President Barack Obama said: ""The victory of 1989 was not inevitable. It was the culmination of centuries of Polish struggle."" But Trump chose a different tone traveling to Warsaw in 2017 to align himself with right-wing forces in Poland and Europe hostile to the EU -- a bloc that the-then President abhorred. In a speech that redefined traditional Western values and fleshed out his own brand of populist nationalism, Trump did reaffirm NATO's Article 5 creed that an attack on one member is an attack on all. But he also slammed US intelligence assessments that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election in remarks that bolstered Putin, warned that a wave of Muslim immigration and lax border controls threatened Western values and lashed out at American journalists in a nation that had been accused by the EU of eroding its own press freedoms. Biden's message will be very different. After meeting Duda in Warsaw on Saturday, the President will deliver a speech that the White House says will frame the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a challenge to the core purpose of his presidency at home and abroad: securing ""a future that is rooted in democratic principles.""",29,6.122051749678907,4.129260273782852,1.9927914758960554,25
2022-03-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/europe/russia-ukraine-chechen-fighting-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html,Chechens are fighting in Ukraine. But are they more hype than help for Vladimir Putin?,"Footage of a firefight that surfaced on social media earlier this week appears to show an unusual group of combatants: Apparent Chechen volunteers fighting on the side of Ukraine against Russia. CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the video, which shows an RPG gunner at work amid an intense fusillade in the village of Velyka Dymerka, roughly 18 miles northeast of Kyiv. This isn't the only evidence of Chechens fighting in Ukraine. On Wednesday, Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin leader of the Chechen Republic -- a region in Russia's north Caucasus -- posted a video of Chechen units engaged in street fighting against Ukrainian forces in the besieged port city of Mariupol. In a commentary on his Telegram account, Kadyrov boasted that the Chechen commander on the scene -- who was being interviewed by the Russian daily Izvestiya -- had maintained heroic calm under fire. ""During the interview, a tank shell flew into the five-story building behind the back of the unsuspecting Timur Ibriev and exploded,"" Kadyrov wrote. ""A fragment hit one of the fighters, but got stuck in a weapon belt. The camera captured the Olympian calm and restraint of my dear BROTHER Timur. He didn't flinch, he didn't duck. You are proud of such cold-blooded and brave fighters!"" Telegram is Kadyrov's preferred propaganda outlet: Since the launch of Russia's invasion of Ukraine one month ago, Kadryrov has posted a stream of videos from the front lines crowing about the prowess of the Chechen soldiers fighting on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also claimed to have been in Ukraine, just outside the capital -- an assertion Ukrainian officials cast doubt on, prompting irate Telegram posts from Kadyrov. Just days into the war, Kadyrov even urged the Russian military to take the gloves off and expand its offensive in Ukraine. ""The time has come to make a concrete decision and start a large-scale operation in all directions and territories of Ukraine,"" Kadyrov said in a statement on his Telegram account. ""I myself have repeatedly developed tactics and strategies against terrorists, participated in battles. In my understanding, the tactics chosen in Ukraine are too slow. It lasts a long time and, in my view, are not effective."" There are several levels of irony here. Images of the devastated city of Mariupol are eerily reminiscent of Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, which was leveled by Russian forces in a brutal war that went through two phases in the mid-1990s and the early 2000s. And Kadyrov himself was once a guerrilla who fought against Russia before switching sides. Kadyrov has been accused by international and independent observers of gross human rights violations in his home territory and beyond. He leads sizeable paramilitary forces that -- while formally a part of Russian security structures -- have personal loyalty to him. Those troops, known as Kadyrovtsy, or Kadyrov's men, have a fearsome reputation. During the Second Chechen War, which began in 1999 and coincided with the rise of Putin, Kadyrov's men helped Moscow wrest control of the Chechen Republic from separatist rebels. They also earned a reputation for brutality, with investigative journalists and human rights researchers documenting a pattern of disappearances and extrajudicial killings by his forces. But despite the fearsome reputation of Kadyrov's Chechen fighters, their performance on the battlefield in Ukraine may have been mixed at best. A profanity-laced video of a shattered Russian column in the western Kyiv suburb of Bucha -- posted on the official Telegram channel of the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine -- showed ruined vehicles that purportedly belonged to Kadyrov's men. And the Kadyrovtsy may find themselves facing other Chechens on battlefields in Ukraine. The Ukrainian politician who first published the video of the fighting in Velyka Dymerka claimed the men seen in action were Chechens who fled Russia's war there, and were fighting on the side of Ukraine. The exact details of such claim would be difficult to immediately verify. There is a sizeable Chechen population that fled the Russian Federation in the wake of the wars there. But there is also a significant Chechen diaspora in the Middle East, including the descendants of those who settled in parts of the Ottoman Empire following Russia's conquest of the north Caucasus. Ukraine also has a significant population of Muslims of other ethnicities, some of whom have joined various Ukrainian military formations to fight against Russia and Russian proxies since 2014. The fight at Velyka Dymerka may be a case of one such unit in action. Video of the firefight was posted on the Telegram channel that appears to belong to the Sheikh Mansur battalion, a group that originally formed as one of Ukraine's volunteer units to fight pro-Russian separatists in 2014. The video posted by the Sheikh Mansur battalion Telegram account suggests that Chechen fighters opposed to Russia -- and to Kadyrov -- are also intent on advertising their ability to fight. ""Unfortunately, during the attack, one of our fighters, who knows how to shoot video properly, fell ill and was not present in the battle,"" the post said. ""For this reason, not all of the video of the fight was filmed, but what was filmed was filmed in part on phones by some young fighters."" How significant are these combatants are to the overall course of the war? That is open to debate. But Chechens on both sides appear to be waging a propaganda war in parallel with the fight on the ground.",14,5.327429561348219,5.67544783468928,-0.3480182733410606,24
2022-03-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/politics/alleged-russian-hackers-indicted/index.html,4 Russian government operatives indicted for allegedly hacking global energy facilities between 2012 and 2018,"The United States has indicted four Russian men, including three Russian intelligence officers, for alleged hacking campaigns that targeted hundreds of energy companies around the world from 2012 to 2018, the US Justice Department said Thursday. The indictments cover activity from years ago but underscore Russian hacking capabilities against critical infrastructure at a time when US officials are on high alert for Russian cyberattacks and as President Joe Biden meets with European allies over Russia's war in Ukraine. Biden on Monday publicly warned US business executives that Kremlin-linked hackers could target US organizations as the Russian military continues to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine. The FBI also advised the private sector last week that hackers associated with Russian internet addresses have been scanning the networks of five US energy companies in a possible prelude to hacking attempts. There are no known compromises from that recent activity. But the new Justice Department charges point to Russia's hacking prowess and showcase the type of activity the US government is concerned about in light of tensions over Russia's war on Ukraine. In one indictment unsealed Thursday, three officers at Russia's FSB intelligence agency are accused of hacking into energy firms, including some in the US, from 2012 to 2017 ""in furtherance of the Russian government's efforts to maintain surreptitious"" access to organizations in the energy sector, the Justice Department said. US officials have expressed concern that Russian operatives could use that type of access to disrupt US critical infrastructure firms if Moscow had the incentive to. In the other indictment, an employee of a Russian Ministry of Defense research institute is accused of helping hack into a petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia in 2017 and causing it to shut down twice. That hacking incident caused alarm in the cybersecurity industry at the time because the malicious code used in the incident targeted safety systems that prevent explosions in power plants. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. All four of the indicted men are believed to be in Russia. ""In these two cases, we've determined that the benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future,"" a senior Justice Department official said. ""These charges show the dark art of the possible when it comes to critical infrastructure."" The three FSB officers are accused of being part of a hacking group that targeted numerous energy firms in the US and abroad from 2012 to 2017, including the computer network of a corporation that runs a power plant in Kansas. ""Although this (hacking) group is not associated with any known, deliberate disruptive event, today's indictment and previous research shows how extensively this group operated to breach critical systems globally,"" Joe Slowik, senior manager at cybersecurity firm Gigamon, told CNN. ""In light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, this activity becomes especially concerning as potential footholds for future destructive events."" Before the 2020 US election, the hacking group breached certain state and local government organizations, but the activity did not affect voting in any way. The other Russian hacking group referenced by Thursday's news, which was involved in the 2017 shutdown of the facility in Saudi Arabia, subsequently attempted to breach the computers of a US firm ""that managed similar critical infrastructure entities in the United States,"" the Justice Department said in a news release. That hacking attempt was unsuccessful, the senior Justice Department official told reporters Thursday. In December, the same hacking group probed the computer networks of US electric utilities that operate liquefied natural gas facilities, CNN previously reported. US officials have briefed firms from the US energy and financial sectors, among others, extensively on Russian hacking capabilities in recent months, and many big firms have invested heavily in cyber defenses in recent years.

2022-03-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/europe/ukraine-russian-warship-berdyansk-intl/index.html,Ukrainians claim to have destroyed large Russian warship in Berdyansk,"Ukrainian armed forces on Friday identified a large Russian landing ship that they said they destroyed at the port of Berdyansk in southern Ukraine the day before. The port, which had recently been occupied by Russian forces with several Russian warships in dock, was rocked by a series of heavy explosions soon after dawn on Thursday. Social media videos showed fires raging at the dockside, with a series of secondary explosions reverberating across the city. The Ukrainian armed forces on Friday named the ship as the ""Saratov."" In earlier reporting, the ship was named as the ""Orsk."" In a statement, the armed forces said: ""In the Azov operational zone, according to updated information, a large landing ship ""Saratov"" was destroyed during the attack on the occupied Berdiansk port. Large landing ships ""Caesar Kunikov"" and ""Novocherkassk"" were [also] damaged. Other losses of the enemy are being clarified."" Several Russian ships had been unloading military equipment at Berdyansk in recent days, according to reports from the port by Russian media outlets. The United States said that Ukraine likely did conduct a successful attack against Russian ships in Berdiansk, according to a defense official, though it is unclear what type of weapon or weapons were used in the attack. It echoes a similar statement from the British Ministry of Defence, which said that Ukrainian forces have attacked ""high value targets"" in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, including a landing ship and ammunition depots at Berdyansk. Analysis of videos uploaded on Thursday showed that one Russian naval vessel left the port soon after the explosions. The Russian Ministry of Defense has made no official comment about the explosion. Berdyansk sits on the Azov Sea and is roughly 45 miles (70 kilometers) southwest of Mariupol. The city has a small naval base and a population of about 100,000. Russian military troops first occupied Berdyansk government buildings on February 27, three days after Russia's invasion began. Mariupol still eludes Russian control despite being surrounded and mercilessly pummeled, block by block, by Russian firepower. Its defenders rejected an ultimatum to surrender by Monday morning, thwarting a Russian effort to finalize a land bridge linking Crimea with the separatist republics of the eastern Donbas region. Russia has fired on Mariupol from the Sea of Azov, according to a senior US defense official, using a group of approximately seven ships to launch attacks on the critical coastal city. Further west, Ukrainians have been fighting to take back the city of Kherson, as well as pushing Russian forces from the northeast of Mykolaiv, forcing them to reposition south of the city, a senior US defense official said Tuesday. The official cautioned that the US cannot say whether these moves are part of a ""larger operational plan"" by the Ukrainians, but called the Ukrainian defense ""nimble"" and ""agile."" This story has been updated with new information from Ukrainian officials.",14,6.584199816417648,2.6230615405976963,3.961138275819952,29
2022-03-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/europe/ukraine-war-russian-soldiers-deaths-cmd-intl/index.html,"The bodies of Russian soldiers are piling up in Ukraine, as Kremlin conceals true toll of war","Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) — The first warm, sunny days of spring in the southern Mykolaiv region are ushering in a grim new reality: the smell of the dead. As the frost melts and ground thaws, the bodies of Russian soldiers strewn across the landscape are becoming a problem. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Vitaly Kim, the region's governor, called on local residents to help collect the corpses and put them in bags, as temperatures rise to above freezing. ""We're not beasts, are we?"" he implored residents, who have already lost so many of their own in this war. Mykolaiv was among the first regional capitals to be attacked after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on February 24. After pushing into the urban center, Russian troops have been forced out by Ukraine's military, leaving a trail of blackened combat vehicles and tanks in their wake. But the battle for the city, a cornerstone in Russia's westward quest along the Black Sea coast to Odesa, is still raging and it's unclear how long Ukrainian forces will be able to fend off the assault. Referring to them as ""orcs""— the evil, monstrous army in J. R. R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" — Kim said that the Russians had retreated and left their colleagues' charred bodies behind on the battlefield. He sent CNN pictures of the abandoned corpses, adding: ""There are hundreds of them, all over the region."" The governor has called for the bodies to be placed into refrigerators and sent back to Russia for identification through DNA testing. But, a month into the war, it is still unclear how or if the remains of soldiers are being repatriated to Russia, where reports about the death toll have largely been silenced. The country has cracked down on any information about the realities of the bloody war, restricting access to Western media reports, as well as the social networks Twitter and Facebook, in Russian territory. Exactly how many Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine remains a mystery. The official line from Russia's defense ministry was 498 military personnel until Monday, when pro-Putin Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda published a report updating the toll to 9,861. The figure, which was attributed to the ministry and later retracted by the paper — which claimed it was hacked — has not been confirmed by the Kremlin, whose spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday told CNN: ""As far as the numbers are concerned, we agreed from the very beginning that we do not divulge the information."" That number tallies with information shared with CNN by US and NATO officials, who gave a recent estimate that Russian casualties range from between 3,000 and 10,000. Ukrainian officials have claimed the toll is even higher, at more than 15,000. CNN has been unable to verify the overall number of Russian deaths. One of the most searing, early images of the war in Ukraine was of a dead Russian soldier, his face and body obscured by a dusting of newly fallen snow. The picture, shot by New York Times photojournalist Tyler Hicks, captured the anonymity of the more than 150,000 Russians sent to fight their neighbors — and the anxiety of Russian families desperate to find out any information about their fate. The Ukrainian government has claimed that the Russian army sent mobile crematoriums to burn their own dead. ""The Russian people dying here, nobody is counting them, people dying in this war. Do you know they have brought a cremation chamber with them? They're not going to show the bodies to their families. They're not going to tell the mothers that their children died here,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters in a briefing on March 3. On the same day, Ukrzaliznytsia, the state-owned Ukrainian Railways, said in a statement on its website that it had provided Ukraine's armed forces with 20 refrigerated cars for the removal of dead Russian soldiers from several areas, including Odesa. Just 72 hours later, Ukrzaliznytsia's chairman posted a message on his personal Telegram channel saying that Russia never came to load them. ""For the sake of 'victorious' propaganda, they are ready to deprive mothers of even the opportunity to bury the bodies,"" Oleksandr Kamyshin wrote. Ukraine's government said it is still waiting to receive a request from Russian authorities for the repatriation of the bodies of those killed. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister said the issue of collecting and identifying the bodies had been discussed in a meeting between Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, on Thursday. But the ICRC has not confirmed whether it is assisting Ukraine in the return of Russian remains to their home country, which is provided for under international law. Hints at the scale of Russia's troop losses have begun to emerge in videos and reports. On March 18, the Belarus service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a US-funded media organization, published images of Russian ambulance convoys appearing to arrive at field hospitals in southern Belarus, near Ukraine's border, and reported that morgues in the area were overflowing. A March 21 report by English-language Ukrainian media outlet The Kyiv Independent followed a Ukrainian emergency response unit digging up Russian soldiers buried in unmarked communal graves in Rusaniv, a village east of the capital — left in a heap without identification documents or IDs. Russian state media reports have stuck to the 498 figure and few funerals have been documented in the country, where censorship of the war has been taken to an extreme with a new law criminalizing reporting contradicting the Kremlin. In the absence of information about Russia's dead, Ukrainians have been trying to fill in the gaps. A website and Telegram channel established by the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, aimed at Russian families, publishes a steady stream of photos of dead soldiers and captured young men, sometimes alongside their identity cards. The name of the site, 200rf.com, is a grim nod to Gruz-200, or Cargo-200, a military code word that came into use in the 1980s during the war in Afghanistan, used by the Soviets for the bodies of soldiers placed in zinc-lined coffins for transport. Viktor Andrusiv, an adviser to Ukraine's internal affairs minister and the creator and coordinator of the channel, also known as ""Look for Your Own,"" said he launched the initiative to help Russian families track down information about their soldiers. ""We are not making war against the Russian people. And I don't think they should suffer because of their regime, which lies to them and says everything is good, no one is dying,"" he told CNN. ""It's a way for us to bring them some truth."" But identifying dead Russian soldiers has been a difficult task. Andrusiv said only 30 have been found on the Telegram channel by their relatives, who scan through gruesome images of those killed in action for clues about whether their loved ones are alive or dead. Ukrainian forces send Andrusov images of deserted bodies, but they're often unrecognizable and have no documents on them. ""It's very difficult to identify the dead because normally they don't have documents with them, normally the commanders take their documents and put them in some boxes. Normally they die in this fire, in shelling. And you cannot identify the metal 'dog tags,' where their number is written, it gives us no information about the person,"" Andrusiv said. And as March turns to April, and temperatures climb to around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, the problem is getting worse. ""The problem with Russian bodies is really huge. It's thousands of them. Before the war, the weather was cold, it was okay but now we have problems because Russians don't want to take the bodies,"" Andrusiv said. ""I actually don't know what we will do in the next weeks with their bodies.""",13,4.202852107961232,6.7343309267066065,-2.5314788187453745,15
2022-03-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/russian-cyberattacks-what-matters/index.html,A cyberattack could lead to war. But it is very unlikely,"President Joe Biden issued an urgent and ominous warning to American individuals and businesses Monday, when he said ""evolving intelligence"" suggests Russia might be planning cyberattacks against the US. On Tuesday, an FBI advisory was sent to US companies in the energy, defense and financial sectors, warning of potential prep work for hacking from IP addresses in Russia. This activity is likely ""not about espionage, it's probably very likely about disruptive or destructive (cyber) activity,"" US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said during a phone briefing with industry executives and state and local government personnel, according to three sources on the call, writes CNN's Sean Lyngaas. Many warnings of a looming Russian cyberattack The advisory is part of a growing chorus of warnings that US infrastructure is at risk, writes Lyngass. ""For months, the US departments of Energy, Treasury and Homeland Security, among others, have briefed big electric utilities and banks on Russian hacking capabilities, and urged businesses to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious activity."" Some companies aren't prepared The bottom line of Biden's warning Monday and the FBI advisory was that the infrastructure behind US society and American life is mostly in private hands and that it needs to be made more secure from hacks. Anybody who remembers the ransomware attacks on the major US food manufacturer JBS, US cities, an oil pipeline and hospital systems in recent years knows this to be true. Biden has told Putin to cut it out Biden has warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to use cyberattacks against the US. The President on Monday referred to the conversations as an ""altar call."" ""We've had a long conversation about, if he uses it, what would be the consequence,"" Biden told business leaders on Monday. Biden has more control over that consequence than he does over the preparedness of US companies that are involved in American infrastructure. He appealed to their sense of ""patriotic obligation"" to get their cyber-defense capabilities up to scratch. He specifically mentioned the energy, power and financial sectors. What might a large-scale cyberattack look like? It's happened before. Estonia was the victim of a large-scale cyberattack in 2007, although there was not enough evidence to definitively pin it on Russia at the time. CNN's Ivana Kottasová wrote about the attack, which Estonia considered an act of cyber-warfare, last June. It all started with Estonia's decision to remove a Soviet-era war memorial from central Tallinn. Here are some key lines from her report: The attack made Estonia realize that it needed to start treating cyber threats in the same way as physical attacks. At that time, the country was already a leader in e-government, having introduced services like online voting and digital signatures. While no data was stolen during the incident, the websites of banks, the media and some government services were targeted with distributed denial of service attacks that lasted for 22 days. Some services were disrupted, while others were taken down completely. NATO and the international community took notice of the attack on Estonia and experts developed a standard to assess cyber-war as a result. When is a cyberattack an act of war? I called Tess Bridgeman, co-editor in chief of the website Just Security and a former attorney in the Obama White House who is an expert on war powers and international law. ""If a cyberattack causes significant death, destruction or injury, of the same sort that you would see from a more traditional attack using kinetic means, like bullets or missiles, you know, then you would call it a 'use of force' in international law,"" she said. A cyberattack that targeted a dam or air traffic control towers might rise to this level, but the government would try very hard to avoid responding to a cyberattack with a military attack, she said. The attacks on the US to date have fallen short of the threshold to justify a military response. As the government seeks countermeasures to respond, Bridgeman said, there's a good chance they won't be publicly known. ""It may appear that the US is sitting by idly, but I would be highly doubtful that that's the case,"" she said, arguing that defensive actions might be more effective at de-escalating the standoff. ""It's setting the example for what responsible state behavior looks like."" Could weapons be used to respond to a cyberattack? The threat of a military response is always there for the worst cyberattacks, should they cost American lives. ""Our policy, our declared policy is, if it's a big enough attack on us and it hurts us, we will use the conventional weapons response,"" Richard Clarke, who was a top adviser to President George W. Bush on cybersecurity, told CNN's Michael Smerconish shortly after the war in Ukraine began. ""So we could very easily find ourselves in a shooting war with Russia if they try devastating -- and that would have to be devastating -- cyberattacks like turning out the power grid,"" Clarke said. Most of these attacks are meant to be part of espionage campaigns or to be meddlesome rather than deadly. Clarke argued that Russian attacks on US industries could be more devastating than attacks on the government itself. He said the government doesn't really know what would happen if the Amazon, Google and Microsoft cloud systems went offline, for instance. ""I can tell you if those clouds go down, the United States stops working, our economy stops working, the phones stop working -- we will find ourselves pretty soon in the dark ages if the internet goes down,"" said Clarke. What if Russia attacked a US ally? It's not clear that Russia would want to provoke the US specifically in a such a devastating way, or how the US would respond. While its cyberattacks in Ukraine since the war began have been less severe than some expected, according to a report by Lyngass, Russia has targeted internet infrastructure in parts of the country. There has been concern that cyberattacks in Ukraine could spill over to nearby countries that are in NATO and could lead the organization to invoke Article 5 of its charter -- the principle that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members. Could a cyberattack trigger Article 5? A cyberattack could absolutely trigger Article 5. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made this clear in February just after Russia's invasion. ""An attack on one will be regarded as an attack on all,"" Stoltenberg said at a news conference when asked about a potential Russian cyberattack. But he added that NATO would be very careful in assessing an attack and would make sure a cyberattack on Ukraine -- shutting off electricity, say -- that accidentally spilled over into Poland or Romania is not construed as an attack on those countries. He also said it's intentionally unclear what kind of cyberattack would rise to the level of invoking Article 5. NATO, he said, would not want to ""give a potential adversary the privilege of defining exactly when we trigger Article 5.""",3,6.062754844657261,6.605297396611467,-0.542542551954206,23
2022-03-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/europe/ukraine-new-phase-analysis-cmd-intl/index.html,Ukraine has denied Russia a victory for four weeks. A grim new phase could be coming,"On Monday, after intense fighting, Ukrainian forces regained control of Makariv, a town west of Kyiv that had been battered by Russian airstrikes. It's tempting to view this small victory for Ukrainian forces as a shift of momentum in the battle for Kyiv: In better times, this suburb would be only an hour's drive to Khreshchatyk, the capital's central boulevard. Kyiv once appeared to be the primary objective of what the Kremlin must have envisioned as a swift regime-change operation. The capital has been rocked by explosions in recent days, but it is far from encircled. On the Azov Sea, the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol -- despite being surrounded and mercilessly pummeled, block by block, by Russian firepower -- still eludes Russian control. Its defenders rejected an ultimatum to surrender by Monday morning, thwarting a Russian effort to finalize a land bridge linking Crimea with the separatist republics of the eastern Donbas region. Nearly a month after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian military has perceptibly shifted its messaging. The Russian military's advances have been stymied, the Ukrainians say, forcing a shift in Russian tactics. ""Due to the lack of success of the ground phase of the operation, the enemy continues to actively launch missile and bomb strikes on important military and civilian infrastructure using operational and tactical aircraft, high-precision missile weapons and indiscriminate munitions,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a statement Tuesday. There's plenty of evidence to suggest that the Russians are taking more of a standoff approach, launching salvos of missiles from outside of Ukrainian airspace. In a statement released Sunday, Russia's defense ministry said warships in the Caspian sea launched Kalibr cruise missiles and aircraft launched Kinzhal hypersonic missile systems from the airspace over Crimea. Those missiles targeted what the Russians described as a large storage base for fuels and lubricants of the Ukrainian military near the settlement of Kostyantynivka, in the southern Mykolaiv region. Separately, the Russian military said Kalibr cruise missiles were fired from the Black Sea, targeting a workshop for the repair of Ukrainian armored vehicles. Russian precision missiles also targeted what Russia described as a Ukrainian military training center near the settlement of Ovruch, in the northern Zhytomyr region. There is an element of PR to such costly displays of firepower: Russia is keen to export a version of the Kalibr and it has touted the Kinzhal as being able to elude missile-defense systems. The UK defense ministry, for one, was dismissive of Russian claims about the Kinzhal's combat debut, saying its use was ""highly likely intended to detract from a lack of progress in Russia's ground campaign. Deployment of Kinzhal is highly unlikely to materially affect the outcome of Russia's campaign in Ukraine."" Such assessments, however, give little solace to anyone on the receiving end of Russian firepower. Dozens were killed Friday in a missile strike on a barracks housing soldiers in Mykolaiv, and Russian long-distance strikes have struck areas far away from the front lines: At least 35 people were killed in strikes on March 13 against the Yavoriv military training ground in the Lviv region of western Ukraine, not far from the Polish border. More than 30 missiles fired from warplanes over the Black and Azov seas hit the base. Still, Russia has thus far not captured any major Ukrainian city in the offensive: neither Kharkiv in the northeast, nor Odesa in the southwest. Even Sumy and Chernihiv in the north, both of which are just across the border from major military staging areas inside Russia, remain under Ukrainian control. And in Kherson, a medium-sized city in the south under Russian control, Russian forces have faced another protracted problem: Angry locals who gather daily in the central square to tell Russian troops go home. One of those rallies ended Monday with one man seriously injured after Russian troops used gunfire and apparent stun grenades to disperse the crowd. Military analysts worry about another consequence of this emerging phase of the war: As Russian ground forces become bogged down and make little new progress, their leaders resort more to the indiscriminate and punitive use of firepower against Ukrainian cities. A March 19 assessment by the Institute for the Study of War gave precisely that grim prognosis. ""If the war in Ukraine settles into a stalemate condition, Russian forces will continue to bomb and bombard Ukrainian cities, devastating them and killing civilians, even as Ukrainian forces impose losses on Russian attackers and conduct counter-attacks of their own,"" the assessment read. ""The Russians could hope to break Ukrainians' will to continue fighting under such circumstances by demonstrating Kyiv's inability to expel Russian forces or stop their attacks even if the Russians are demonstrably unable to take Ukraine's cities. Ukraine's defeat of the initial Russian campaign may therefore set conditions for a devastating protraction of the conflict and a dangerous new period testing the resolve of Ukraine and the West."" Adding to that gloomy forecast, Ukrainian officials have begun warning of a potential new front in the war, with the country's General Staff saying Sunday the threat of an offensive from Belarus in the direction of northwestern Ukraine was ""high,"" without giving further specifics. Ukraine's northwestern Volyn region borders Belarus to the north and Poland, a NATO ally, to the west. It could -- theoretically -- serve as a gateway for attacking forces from the north to approach Lviv, a strategic city in western Ukraine that is a hub for both government logistics and relief efforts, as well as a transit point for many civilians looking to flee fighting in other parts of the country. Russia has already used Belarusian territory as a launching pad for its invasion, with Russian forces staging an offensive push toward Kyiv and central Ukraine from southern Belarus. It's unclear if Belarus would actively join the war. But the Ukrainian General Staff is already warning that Russia is now looking to bring in reserve forces to the borders of Ukraine. If true, that speaks volumes. It attests to the high cost the Russian military has already paid in terms of lives -- even though the Kremlin has not disclosed casualty totals since March 2. And it speaks to the political will of one person -- Russian President Vladimir Putin -- to continue expending blood and treasure in Ukraine.",14,5.888252015865019,7.237988070249756,-1.3497360543847368,21
2022-03-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/fbi-energy-hacking-warning/index.html,FBI advised that hackers scanned networks of 5 US energy firms ahead of Biden's Russia cyberattack warning,"Hackers associated with Russian internet addresses have been scanning the networks of five US energy companies in a possible prelude to hacking attempts, the FBI said in a March 18 advisory to US businesses obtained by CNN. The FBI issued the notice days before President Joe Biden publicly warned that Kremlin-linked hackers could target US organizations as the Russian military continues to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine and as Western sanctions on the Kremlin begin to bite. Deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger said during Monday's White House briefing that Russia had been conducting ""preparatory activity"" for cyber attacks, which she said could include scanning websites and hunting for software vulnerabilities."" The so-called ""preparatory activity"" that Neuberger mentioned Monday is likely ""not about espionage, it's probably very likely about disruptive or destructive [cyber] activity,"" US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said Tuesday on a phone briefing with industry executives and state and local government personnel, according to three sources on the call. There are at least 18 US companies in other sectors, such as defense and financial services that were subjected to the scanning, the FBI said. There are no confirmed breaches related to the scanning, but the FBI advisory is the latest in a chorus of warnings from US officials to critical infrastructure operators to be on alert for potential Russian hacking. The FBI advisory was meant for a private, technical audience to help companies protect their networks, while Biden's public warning was generic and meant to raise awareness of the threat. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming,"" Biden told business executives on Monday. The Russia-based Internet Protocol addresses, or data that identifies a computer, are ""believed to be associated with cyber actors who previously conducted destructive cyber activity against foreign critical infrastructure,"" the FBI said in its advisory. ""This scanning activity has increased since the start of the Russia/Ukraine conflict, leading to a greater possibility of future intrusions,"" the FBI memo states. CBS News first reported on the FBI advisory. For months, the US departments of Energy, Treasury and Homeland Security, among others, have briefed big electric utilities and banks on Russian hacking capabilities, and urged businesses to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious activity. CNN reported on February 2 that a foreign hacking group had probed the computer networks of US electric utilities that operate liquefied natural gas facilities. The hacking group developed tools used in an incident that forced a Saudi petrochemical plant to shut down in 2017, according to cybersecurity researchers. The Treasury Department in 2020 sanctioned a Russian government institute for its alleged involvement in that incident. An FBI spokesperson did not respond when CNN asked whether the bureau was referring to the same hacking group in its recent advisory. The spokesperson said in an emailed statement: ""While our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence products, the FBI routinely shares information with our law enforcement and industry partners in order to protect the communities they serve and work with. The FBI always encourages members of the public and private industry to be vigilant and report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement.""

2022-03-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/analysis-biden-warning-putin-cyberattack-us/index.html,Putin's next escalation could be a direct cyberattack on the US,"The most troubling takeaway from President Joe Biden's warning that there is ""evolving intelligence"" that Russia is exploring options for cyberattacks is that US spy agencies have been spot on so far in predicting Vladimir Putin's moves. It was always possible that the Russian leader could seek to impose direct reprisals on the US government and Americans for their support of Ukrainians and crippling sanctions on Russia after his brutal invasion. Putin could turn his intelligence agencies or related criminal gangs against US government departments, hospitals, critical infrastructure and utilities. Opening a cyber front, or at least hinting at one, would be consistent with Putin's strategy of escalation, which has seen him rattle nuclear sabers, turn fearsome fire on Ukrainian civilians and use new generation hypersonic missiles. But the key question is whether the Russian leader would risk a full-bore cyber conflict with Washington, which, as CNN reported last week, has fearsome capabilities of its own that may outmatch Russia's arsenal and could quickly deliver devastating hits against Russian critical infrastructure. Biden first warned on Monday in a written statement that it was time for the private sector, which owns much of the nation's critical infrastructure and hasn't always heeded government warnings, to immediately harden its online defenses. Then he took an even more chilling message in person to a Business Roundtable meeting in Washington. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it's coming,"" the President warned. ""He hasn't used it yet, but it's part of his playbook,"" Biden said of Putin. Anne Neuberger, White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said Monday that after detecting ""preparatory activity"" by Russia, the administration had held classified briefings with companies and sectors that could be vulnerable to cyberattacks. But she also said that there was currently no evidence of any specific threat. The White House has consistently warned of a potential cyber front of the Russian war on Ukraine ever since the invasion more than three weeks ago, over and above its regular guidance to state and local governments and big businesses and industry. Putin's motives to attack the US As always with government pronouncements based on intelligence -- and especially in an area as sensitive as potential cyberwarfare -- much remains unknown about the potential threat, the timing of Biden's announcement and the messages he sought to send to Russia with the statement on Monday. But Putin does have burning reasons for wanting to target the United States and inflict pain on Americans. Unprecedented international sanctions are having a devastating effect on the Russian economy. The longer they remain in force, the more they will hurt ordinary Russians. The Russian banking sector is cut off from the world, and the country has become an international pariah. Putin's forces, meanwhile, didn't pull off an expected blitzkrieg to Kyiv. A military stalemate may force Putin to escalate the crisis to increase his own geopolitical leverage with outside powers. And by his actions over many years, the Russian leader has given every impression that he believes he's already waging low intensity warfare against the West. Indeed, Russian intelligence agencies used hacking and influence campaigns in the 2016 and 2020 US elections, according to US intelligence. Putin may also be seeking revenge for the gusher of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons being poured into Ukraine by the West, which are being used to kill Russians in an extraordinary proxy war with Moscow in Europe. So the leap to direct, non-military action against the United States may not be as wide to Putin as it might appear to others. A long record of cyberwarfare Cyberattacks, though they would be an escalation in the current circumstances, would not be a new Russian tactic. Nearly a year ago, Washington blamed the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for the 2020 SolarWinds attack on federal servers and a broad sweep of the public sector and imposed sanctions. A criminal group originating from Russia, named ""DarkSide,"" was believed to be responsible for a ransomware cyberattack on the trans-America Colonial Pipeline last year. At a summit in Geneva last summer, Biden told Putin that certain areas of critical infrastructure should be off-limits for cyberattacks, and outlined 16 specific entities including energy and water. And in its just published Annual Threat Assessment report, the US Intelligence community warned that Russia was developing capabilities to target underwater cables and industrial control systems in the US and elsewhere ""because compromising such infrastructure improves and demonstrates its ability to damage infrastructure during a crisis."" Biden's multiple audiences The idea that Putin would not dare to initiate a cyber conflict with the United States may now be less compelling given the Russian President's dubious decision making in the war so far. Putin has blown through multiple barriers of acceptable behavior with his invasion of a sovereign, independent nation. His offensive has now degenerated into appalling air, artillery and missile attacks on civilians. Having thrown his domestic and international credibility at the war, he cannot afford to lose. That's one reason why the US has warned about the possibility of chemical or biological attacks by Russian forces and why there is deep concern among the community of atomic scientists that the Russians could eventually consider the use of smaller, tactical nuclear weapons as acceptable military doctrine. He could see cyberwarfare as just another deployable weapon. The power of Biden's warning -- even if cyberattacks are not imminent -- was cemented by the intelligence community's success so far in exposing and predicting the Russian military's actions. As more than 100,000 Russian troops massed around Ukraine earlier this year, some officials in Europe and even in Kyiv dismissed warnings that Putin was about to invade as contrary to Russia's own interests. The intelligence success not only contrasted with the community's failures on the Iraq war and ahead of the September 11, 2001 attacks. It also raised the possibility that the United States has strong visibility into the Russian regime. Biden's citing of unspecified, ""evolving intelligence"" on potential cyberattacks is the latest occasion when the US has deployed strategic nuggets of the product of US spy agencies to shape perceptions of the war in the US and abroad. An element of psychological warfare may be also at play given that Putin, a former KGB officer, would be furious at the possibility the US has breached Russian spy agencies. Biden puts big business on alert There is debate among cyberwarfare experts whether Putin would be deterred by the risk that the United States could strike back with even more force at Russia. An in-depth report by CNN's investigative unit last week found that while there have been smaller attacks on Ukrainian banks and government agencies, there has so far been no major cybersecurity disaster, like a blanket power outage, a poisoned water system or a crippled supply chain, in the US or Ukraine since the invasion. There was consensus among nearly 20 experts who spoke with CNN that while Russia is well positioned to launch catastrophic cyberattacks on the United States, it is not likely to do so. The experts believe that Putin understands his country's cyber capabilities are outmatched by those of the US. And Biden underscored again on Monday that the US would respond vigorously to any intrusions, seeking to bolster the deference factor. He vowed to ""use every tool to deter, disrupt, and if necessary, respond to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure."" Biden's statement was also a clear warning to US businesses to make a renewed effort to protect themselves from cyberhacking before it is too late. Some firms lack the capabilities of government to protect themselves. The cost of cybersecurity is particularly onerous for smaller businesses and vendors. US firms face cyberattacks every day that cost millions of dollars. But there was a real sense that Biden's statement was intended as a wake-up to the private sector that something much worse was on the way. As he put it: ""You have the power, the capacity and the responsibility to strengthen the cybersecurity and resilience of the critical services and technologies on which Americans rely.""",3,2.2674369340550413,6.724515901651404,-4.457078967596362,23
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/europe/mariupol-theater-survivors-escape-ukraine-cmd-intl/index.html,They thought they would be safe in the theater. Then it was bombed,"Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) — When Serhii woke up to news reports that a bomb had flattened Mariupol's Drama Theater, where hundreds of people had been sheltering, he couldn't breathe. His wife and their two daughters were inside. A day before the attack, the 56-year-old editor, who lives in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, received a panicked call from his 30-year-old daughter. He hadn't heard from her since March 1, when Russian forces intensified their siege of Mariupol, the strategic port city, launching a relentless barrage of rockets and bombs from land, sky and sea. As electricity and internet service went out, Mariupol was largely cut off from the outside world. Serhii, who asked that only his first name be used for security reasons, waited desperately for any update from his girls. In its absence, he had little choice but to rely on the grim picture of life and death being relayed by Mariupol officials: Residents were living in ""medieval conditions,"" forced to melt snow for water and cook food outside on open fires. Civilian targets, including apartment buildings, a maternity hospital and the main administrative building, were reduced to rubble. Ceasefires were ignored and evacuation corridors blocked. It was a situation that would have been unthinkable a few short weeks ago in the bustling industrial city, once known for its seaside resorts and a major steel plant, and now the scene of fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Serhii worried for his wife, 56, and daughters — especially the eldest, 36, who lives with a disability and needs daily medication. But his relief at finally hearing from them was quickly replaced by a gnawing fear. In a harried conversation, his youngest told him she had been able to charge her phone at a diesel generator, but that she only had a little time to talk. She explained that their apartment had been destroyed in the shelling, and she wasn't sure where they would be safe. He told her to go to the Drama Theater, in the city center, where officials were organizing buses to evacuate residents. ""When I advised them to move to the drama theater as an evacuation site, and the next morning I learned that this place was bombed ... I almost went crazy, insane,"" Serhii told CNN in a phone call from Kyiv. ""Because I actually sent them under the bombs."" The March 16 bombing of Mariupol's theater, where Ukrainian officials say an estimated 1,300 had sought refuge, was among the most brazen of Russia's attacks on civilians since its invasion began in late February. Painted on the ground outside the building — in giant Cyrillic letters — was the word ""CHILDREN."" The message — large enough to be viewed from the sky — was scrawled near a public square that, before the war, was busy in summer with kids swinging on a jungle-gym and running through fountains. Russia has denied its forces hit the theater, claiming instead that the Azov battalion, the Ukrainian army's main presence in Mariupol, blew up the building. After 24 hours of near-hysteria, wondering if his family was still alive, Serhii's phone rang. His daughter told him she had left the theater to check on an elderly relative shortly before the bomb struck. She rushed back to find the building cleaved in half, with the central auditorium of 600 to 800 seats completely flattened, and people drenched in blood and white debris beginning to emerge from the rubble. Among them were her sister, who had been hiding in a portion of the theater that did not collapse, and her mother, who was dug out of the bomb shelter along with other survivors. The three women, carrying nothing but a backpack with their essential documents, managed to catch a ride with six others in a small car, paying the driver all the money they had — 2,000 hryvnia, the equivalent of about $68. She said they got out at a checkpoint manned by Russian soldiers, and walked some 12 miles further on to Melekino, where their neighbors have a dacha, or summer house. The small village on the Sea of Azov is overflowing with displaced people who have poured in from Mariupol, Serhii's daughter told him, adding that there was no food or fuel left. ""In Melekino there is a real famine, a holodomor. People in the villages have no supplies, absolutely all shops are closed,"" Serhii said, referring to the man-made famine that gripped the Soviet republic of Ukraine in the early 1930s, killing millions. The term is derived from the Ukrainian words for hunger (holod) and extermination (mor). Unable to travel himself, Serhii is now frantically searching for a driver who will make the dangerous journey to retrieve his wife and daughters from the dacha where they're camping out. But he hasn't had any luck yet. It's a frightening proposition: any volunteer would run the risk of being caught in the crossfire, or being captured by the Russians. Over the last week, Russian forces have been deporting thousands of Mariupol residents against their will to occupied areas of Ukraine or far-flung cities in Russia itself, according to city officials and witnesses. And on Monday, Moscow called on Mariupol to surrender — a notion Ukraine swiftly shot down. Serhii's family's harrowing escape from Mariupol is among the first stories to surface from survivors of the theater bombing. For days, family and friends of those inside have waited on tenterhooks for news of their fate, posting in local Telegram channels and Facebook groups asking if anyone has seen their loved ones. Posts from some of those who have managed to escape the city haven't instilled much hope, describing basements turned into tombs, and streets littered with dead bodies. Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, told CNN on Sunday that the battle for the city has made it impossible to retrieve and identify the dead, or treat the wounded. ""We cannot carry out rescue operations in the current conditions: Street fighting, shelling, bombing are going on,"" he said of the theater attack, adding that many of the estimated 200 survivors are now in other shelters, or in the process of being evacuated to Zaporizhzhia, a city on the Dnieper River about 140 miles away. On Sunday, another strike hit an art school in the city, where Andriushchenko said 400 people were believed to be sheltering. But with fierce fighting and communications down, it has been difficult to get a clear sense of the loss of life there. In a video message posted to Facebook in the early hours of Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the siege of Mariupol would go down in history as a war crime. ""To do this to a peaceful city ... is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,"" he added. But like the other cities and towns dotted across Ukraine's east and south which are now being strangled by Russian troops, Mariupol has become a black box, with information only beginning to trickle out as residents escape. 'I realized that I could wait no longer.' We had to leave. After the maternity hospital near Anna Kotelnikova's home was hit on March 9, sending pregnant mothers scrambling through the ruins clutching their bellies, she decided to move to her parents' apartment six miles south, in a block overlooking the Drama Theater. Kotelnikova, a 36-year-old anaesthesiologist, has volunteered as a medic for the Ukrainian army since the spring of 2014, when Russia-backed separatists attacked Mariupol; separatist forces held the city for a month before the Ukrainian government wrested back control. Because of her involvement in the conflict, Kotelnikova was strongly advised to leave Mariupol when Russia invaded Ukraine last month. She refused, unable to conceive of the carnage that was in store for her beloved hometown. But as the bombing worsened, the barrage increasingly unpredictable and indiscriminate, she began to change her mind. On the night of March 14, sheltering with her sister, brother-in-law, nephew and her parents — who are in their 80s and lived through Mariupol's occupation by Nazi Germany — she knew they had to leave. ""Every day we heard explosions approaching, bombing. That night was just awful. From midnight until the morning ... The bombing did not stop,"" she told CNN in a call. ""When it was possible to open the curtain ... I saw that everything in the direction of my house was in black smoke."" ""I realized that I could wait no longer,"" she said. Across the square from her parents' apartment, locals and city officials were organizing evacuations at the Drama Theater. Inside, the situation was dire, Kateryna Erskaya, a journalist who had been delivering aid to the site, told CNN. More than a thousand people were camped out inside the unheated building, trying to keep warm in freezing conditions with cardboard boxes, blankets and near constant fires, she said. The blazes, fueled by bits of destroyed homes and tree branches, were used to cook any food people could find. Most people's phones were dead and mobile signals were rare — their only sense of the outside world coming from the roars of planes overhead and the noise of skirmishes nearby. ""This sound of combat was a constant soundtrack,"" said Erskaya. On March 16, just hours before the attack, she managed to flee the city. Kotelnikova did the same a day earlier, on March 15. She sprinted from her parent's apartment to the theater, confirmed that a convoy of more than 200 cars was leaving at 9 a.m. and snapped some photos of the ""CHILDREN"" sign scrawled on the ground, before running home to tell her family to pack. Within an hour, they were out the door. Following advice from friends, she said she wiped her phone, scrubbing it of messages, applications and photos — anything that might give Russian soldiers cause to detain her at a checkpoint on the way out of the city, something that city officials and eyewitnesses say has been happening to activists and volunteers like her. They made it through each stop, slowly navigating the road north to Dnipro, in central Ukraine. The drive, which normally takes nine hours, took two days. They stopped in fields when dusk fell, staying on the road to avoid mines and huddling to keep warm as temperatures dropped to -11 degrees Celsius (12 degrees Fahrenheit). Kotelnikova said that when the group got to Zaporizhia she was overwhelmed with relief. ""I was ready to just get on my knees and kiss the ground."" Others haven't been as lucky. Julia Paevska, also known as ""Taira,"" a storied Ukrainian military medic known for her bravery and compassion, was captured by Russian forces in Mariupol earlier this month, according to local officials. Andriushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said Taira was among a number of activists, law enforcement officers, army veterans and volunteers who have been kidnapped by the Russians. US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on Sunday the reports were ""disturbing"" and ""unco",17,7.406793896563117,1.3340286630605105,6.072765233502606,1
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/europe/ukraine-russia-posad-pokrovske-mykolaiv-kherson-intl/index.html,"Russia could be losing ground in battle for Mykolaiv, but it still seeks to crush what it cannot have","This is the final bus out of the last position Ukraine holds on the road to Kherson -- the first and only major city Russia has taken. Villagers have standing room only, while the elderly have been rushed into a van. ""Grandpa, we are here,"" shouts the daughter of one local, Viktor, from the bus doorway, as he sits a little bewildered in the van. The panic is real; at any moment the shelling could resume, a bombardment that residents say has littered the southern Ukrainian village of Posad-Pokrovske with cluster munitions. As the convoy of two vehicles hits the pockmarked road out toward the city of Mykolaiv, shells once again tar the horizon with a plume of black smoke. Sat in the back of the van, Vitali breaks down, using his grimy, orange workman's gloves to wipe tears from his eyes. ""Civilians! They killed all the people, these are bastards, these are reptiles, parasites,"" he says. ""They don't fight troops, they fight people. Do you understand? Kill everyone. Worse than the fascists."" Next to him sits Viktor, who remembers the last time a war of this ferocity came to this part of Europe. ""Of course I remember,"" he says quietly. ""I saw how the Germans attacked us. They didn't bully people."" Airstrikes, grad rockets, cluster munitions -- the residents recall two weeks of intense bombardment to which the fabric of Posad-Pokrovske bears witness. Barely a building is unscathed, with most roofs missing, and one house is torn down to shreds of cloth. The village's gas main has burst, with the intense hissing of a leak a stark reminder that the tiny settlement is no longer fit for life. The village school has had an entire wall torn off it, stairs that once brimmed with children now echo with a ghostly crunch, as broken glass is trampled underfoot. Soldiers emerge from the doorways of some homes. The Ukrainian marines holding Posad-Pokrovske, the last settlement before the Russian positions that defend Kherson's airport, remain vague about their positions. But their goal is clear: the airport outside Kherson, used as a Russian base, that is already being heavily battered by Ukrainian shelling. One of these marines is Daniyel Salem, a former Lebanese soldier. Salem is married to a Ukrainian and he joined the army the moment the war began. ""Our mission is to kill these m*therf**kers,"" he said, joking that he would like to turn his nascent TV career into a Netflix series in which he gets to assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""This place used to be one of joy,"" he said, gesturing to the village hall around him, ""where they showed movies. The life has been drained out of it."" The road between the strategic port city of Mykolaiv and Russian-held Kherson is a testament to Ukrainian grit and Russia's slow loss of grip on advances it once heralded. Ukraine's forces have made significant gains along the 40-kilometer (25-mile) road between the outskirts of the two cities, and the farmland it splits is scarred with shell impacts from that intense fight. While vulnerable to another reversal, the Ukrainian gains have exposed the limits of Russian military power at the furthest reaches of its supply chains, as well as the tenacity of forces around Mykolaiv fighting for their homes, and the defense of Ukraine's third-largest city, Odesa, which lies further west along the Black Sea coast. Damaged Ukrainian armor sits outside Posad-Pekrovske, and along the road the signs of days of fighting pepper the landscape. Russian shelling also finds its target regularly, with rockets landing near the highway on several occasions witnessed by CNN, the brush set aflame. Ukrainian artillery was also observed in action Sunday, firing toward the north of Kherson. The Ukrainian progress has refreshed life in the city of Mykolaiv, with stores reopening and usurping the fear of encirclement that haunted the past week. Vitaly Kim, the regional head whose regular Telegram messages have rallied Mykolaiv to wartime unison and also alerted the city to daily changing threats, has appeared more relaxed. On Saturday, Kim posted pictures of a pair of socks he had been sent with ""Russian ship, go F**k yourself"" stitched onto them, in reference to the defiant defenders of Snake Island. For his birthday last week, the governor was given a convertible car with a captured Russian machine gun soldered onto its trunk, which his police chief still drives triumphantly around the city. On Sunday, Kim appealed to locals to help pick up the corpses of dead Russian soldiers that had been left behind in the battlefield, asking residents to put them in bags before the temperatures rose above freezing. Kim sent CNN a series of pictures of the abandoned bodies, adding: ""There are hundreds of them, all over the region."" Yet Ukraine's slow advance toward Kherson has also come at heavy cost. On Friday morning, a huge blast ripped through two military facilities near the center of Mykolaiv, the apparent missile strike ripping one barracks in two and reducing another to rubble. Ukraine's military has not released a death toll from the strike, citing operational security. But two military officials told CNN the death toll likely was as high as 30. A medical official also said 40 were injured. One trauma unit took in many of the injured, its beds overflowing Friday afternoon. One soldier, his eye bandaged and head blooded, asks for his wounded friends by name. Another, Alexander, had both legs broken when the building he was sleeping in partially collapsed. ""I was on the third floor,"" he says. ""When it hit, everything fell apart ... I found myself on the second floor, in my t-shirt and underwear,"" Alexander adds. He rubs his eyes to disguise tears, then continues: ""We know the enemy, you must finally see and hear. I don't know. How many deaths does it take for everyone to see?"" The shelling continued over the weekend, with Saturday's dusk lit up by tracer fire and at least eight shells hitting one target to the city's south. Moscow may be losing ground here, but it does all it can to crush and stifle what it cannot have.",17,1.1285371461088411,6.365817948817227,-5.237280802708386,15
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/politics/us-russia-top-military-commander-ukraine-war/index.html,Who is Russia's top field commander in Ukraine? The US isn't sure.,"The US has been unable to determine if Russia has designated a military commander responsible for leading the country's war in Ukraine, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter — something that current and former defense officials say is likely a key contributor to the apparent clumsiness and disorganization of the Russian assault. Without a top, theater-wide commander on the ground in or near Ukraine, units from different Russian military districts operating in different parts of Ukraine appear to be competing for resources rather than coordinating their efforts, according to two US defense officials. Units participating in different Russian offensives across Ukraine have failed to connect, these sources say, and in fact, appear to be acting independently with no overarching operational design. Russian forces also appear to be having significant communication issues. Soldiers and commanders have at times used commercial cell phones and other unsecure channels to talk to each other, making their communications easier to intercept and helping Ukraine develop targets for their own counterstrikes. It's all led to what these sources say has been a disjointed — and at times chaotic — operation that has surprised US and western officials. ""One of the principles of war is 'unity of command,' said CNN military analyst retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a former commander of the US Army in Europe. ""That means someone has to be in overall charge— to coordinate fires, direct logistics, commit reserve forces, measure the success (and failure) of different 'wings' of the operation and adjust actions based on that."" Historically, there have been instances in which Russia has publicized this kind of information, but the Ministry of Defense has not made any reference to a top commander for operations in Ukraine and did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the topic. And while it is possible that Russia has quietly designated a top commander to oversee the invasion — even if the US has been unable to identify that individual — the state of combat operations would suggest ""he's inept,"" according to Hertling. The Russian invasion has also been marked by an inordinate number of casualties among high-ranking Russian officers. The Ukrainians say they have killed five Russian generals during the first three weeks of the war, a claim CNN has not independently confirmed. Still, any military general being killed in combat is a rare event, Retired US Army Gen. David Petraeus told CNN's Jake Tapper during Sunday's State of the Union. Col. Sergei Sukharev, the commander of an elite Russian airborne unit, was also killed in battle in Ukraine, Russian regional state TV network GTRK Kostroma reported Thursday. ""The bottom line is that their command and control has broken down,"" said Petraeus. The sheer size of the invasion has only made things worse. Coordinating operations along a front that measures over 1,000 miles requires ""extensive communication capability and command, control and intelligence resources that the Russians just don't have,"" Hertling added. ""I can't see that anything the navy is doing is coordinated with the anything the air force is doing or anything the land force is doing,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, another former commander of the US Army in Europe, who cautioned that he had no inside knowledge of the US understanding of Russia's command structure. ""The Russians have had tremendous difficulties with command and control during this operation at all echelons,"" echoed a US source familiar with the situation on the ground. ""Some of this may be due to actions by the Ukrainians themselves."" On the ground, Russian troops in the field have often been cut off from their senior commanders, sources said. ""The guys in the field go out and they have their objective, but they have no way to radio back [if something goes wrong],"" said another source familiar with the intelligence, who added that western officials believe this is part of the reason that some Russian troops have been observed abandoning their own tanks and armored personnel carriers in the field and simply walking away. A stalled campaign Since Russia launched its assault on Ukraine on Feb. 24, it has bombarded Ukrainian cities with missiles and artillery, destroying apartments, hospitals and schools and leaving scores of civilians dead. But its ground invasion has largely stalled amid fierce resistance from the Ukrainians and what senior defense officials have described as tactical errors. The airspace over Ukraine remains contested and Russia has failed to take control of any major cities, including Kyiv. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday told CNN's Don Lemon that the US has ""seen a number of missteps"" by Russia. Moscow has ""struggled with logistics,"" he said, adding that he has not seen evidence of ""good employment of tactical intelligence"" nor ""integration of air capability with a ground maneuver."" Both current officials and outside analysts point out that although Russia has deployed its military in other recent conflicts, including in Syria and in Crimea in 2014, it has not tried anything even remotely as ambitious as a full-scale invasion of a large nation like Ukraine that would require air and ground integration and coordinated effort by units from multiple different military regional districts. Russia rotates its annual military exercises between its regional military districts, Hodges said — rather than conducting the kind of so-called ""joint"" exercises that the United States routinely employs to ensure smooth coordination between disparate pieces of its sprawling military. ""They don't have any experience at this, not at this kind of a scale,"" he said. ""It's been decades since they would have done something on this scale. What they did in Syria and Crimea in 2014 is nothing compared to this."" And, he added, ""It doesn't seem to me that they've actually exercised this in a way that would have demonstrated that they would have to have a joint operational commander."" Putin's reliance on secrecy Some officials have also suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin kept planning for the overall operation so closely held within the Kremlin that many of his own military commanders in the field didn't fully understand the mission until the last minute — likely preventing different arms of Russia's military from coordinating effectively in the run-up to the invasion. ""In the assessments we see it is clear some people on the [Russian] defense side are not really understanding what the game plan is,"" a senior European official said in early February, just weeks prior to the invasion. The official added that the assessments suggest the defense personnel think ""it's a very difficult game plan to stand up."" The lack of central organization also has implications for Russia's efforts to resupply its forces. Moscow has struggled to provide sufficient food, fuel and munitions to troops in the field — and as its casualties have mounted, officials say there are indications that Russia is seeking to replenish its losses with both foreign fighters and existing Russian troops stationed elsewhere. Without a theater commander, strategic allocation of limited resources could prove challenging, Hodges said. ""That's the job of the joint force commander: to allocate priorities,"" he said. ""Who gets the priority for fuel, ammunition or particular capability.""",14,6.121446460229037,3.2184802019186174,2.9029662583104194,12
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/europe/ukraine-monday-reset-03-21-intl/index.html,Seven key developments in the Ukraine conflict this weekend,"Civilian casualties continue to mount as a result of Russian attacks on Ukraine, and the besieged city of Mariupol has refused to surrender despite constant bombardment. Here are the key developments from the weekend. Ukrainian officials reject Russian request to surrender Mariupol Russian forces continued their assault on the southeastern city of Mariupol, striking an art school turned bomb shelter on Sunday. The city council put the number sheltering in the school building at 400, but Petro Andrushenko, an adviser to the city mayor, said it was not clear how many people were there. In a video message late Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there were no military positions near the art school. Most of the people sheltering there were ""women and children, the elderly. They are under the rubble. We do not know how many are alive now, but we know that the pilot who dropped that bomb will definitely be shot down,"" he said. Russia issued an ultimatum to city authorities to surrender before dawn Monday, but both the government in Kyiv and the Mariupol city authorities rejected the Russian terms. Zelensky said Sunday that Russia's actions in Mariupol were an ""act of terror that will be remembered for centuries."" Dozens of care home residents killed by Russian tank attack Fifty-six elderly residents of a care home in the eastern Ukrainian town of Kreminna were killed when a Russian tank opened fire on the facility, according to Serhii Haidai, the head of the Luhansk region. The attack happened on March 11, said Haidai, who added that 15 other residents of the care home had been abducted and taken to the town of Svatove in what is now Russian-occupied territory. CNN has been unable to independently verify the claim. Russia continues to attack civilian targets across Ukraine. At least 902 civilians have been killed and 1,459 injured since the start of the invasion, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said Sunday. Russia loses another general Ukrainian forces killed Russian General Oleg Mityaev of the 150th Motorized Rifle Division near Mariupol, according to a Telegram post shared by Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Interior Minister, last week. On Sunday, Aleksei Arestovich, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, told Ukraine's NV News that Mityaev ""most likely went to show, by example, how to fight. Because his soldiers refused to fight."" Neither the Russian Ministry of Defense nor Russian state media have issued any statements on his death. CNN cannot independently verify the Ukrainian claim. Ukrainian officials say a total of five Russian generals have been killed since the invasion began on February 24. If true, this would be an unusually high number of high-ranking soldiers to have been killed in three weeks of combat. In addition, a deputy commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was confirmed killed by two senior Russian officials on Sunday. Russia launches hypersonic missiles The Russian military claimed it had launched a series of strikes on military targets in Ukraine employing hypersonic and cruise missiles on Saturday night and Sunday morning. In a statement released on Sunday, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Igor Konashenkov said sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles were fired from the Caspian Sea, and air-launched Kinzhal hypersonic missile systems were fired from airspace over Crimea. US officials also confirmed to CNN that Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine last week, the first known use of such missiles in combat. The launches were likely intended to test the weapons and send a message about Russian capabilities, multiple sources told CNN. Rising concerns over risk of attack from Belarus On Sunday, Ukraine's General Staff said the threat of an offensive from Belarus into northwestern Ukraine is ""high,"" without providing additional details. ""The level of threat from the territory of Belarus in the direction of Volyn is evaluated as high,"" the military said in a statement via the presidential office, adding: ""Defense forces of Ukraine are ready to resist."" Ukraine's northwestern Volyn region borders Belarus to the north and Poland, a NATO member, to the west. It could serve as a gateway for attacking forces from the north to approach Lviv, a strategic city in western Ukraine. Lviv is a hub for both Ukrainian government logistics and relief efforts, as well as a transit point for many civilians looking to flee fighting in other parts of the country. The Russian military has already used Belarusian territory as a launchpad for its invasion of Ukraine, with forces staging an offensive push toward Kyiv and central Ukraine from southern Belarus. There is no direct evidence that Belarus' troops have participated in hostilities. Russia accused of detaining reporters, activists and officials On Saturday, Ukrainian digital broadcaster Hromadske said its reporter Victoria Roshchina had gone missing and was believed to be being held by Russian forces. Ukraine's human rights commissioner, Liudmyla Denisova, said Saturday the government believed she had been kidnapped by Russian forces in the town of Berdyansk, which lies on the Black Sea coast and is under Russian occupation. Roshchina's disappearance comes amid reports of other activists and officials being held against their will in other parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine. In Kherson region, Dmytro Vasyliev, a senior council official in the town of Nova Kakhovka, was abducted last week, according to the town's mayor. Human rights organization ZMINA said some 17 people had been abducted by Russian forces in Ukraine since the start of the war. Zelensky repeats call for NATO admission in CNN interview In an exclusive interview on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian President told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that he is ready to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""I'm ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations, we cannot end this war,"" said Zelensky, who also warned that failed negotiations could mean the fight between the two countries would lead to ""a third World War."" Zelensky told Zakaria that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if the country had been admitted into the NATO alliance. ""If we were a NATO member, a war wouldn't have started. I'd like to receive security guarantees for my country, for my people,"" said Zelensky. The Ukrainian president said he was grateful for military aid sent by the alliance, but he continued his push for NATO admission for his country. ""If NATO members are ready to see us in the alliance, then do it immediately because people are dying on a daily basis,"" he said.",17,4.091646075078228,3.2284985759685783,0.8631474991096497,29
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/europe/russia-ukraine-junkyard-weapons-intl-hnk/index.html,Inside the Kyiv junkyard that recycles Russian weapons for Ukrainian forces,"The sound of rockets launching in the distance breaks the silence of an otherwise quiet morning in Kyiv. ""That's us, we're attacking Russian positions close to Hostomel,"" a Ukrainian soldier says, as the shots fire in a synchronized rhythm. In this particular instance, the rockets the Ukrainian military is using to target Moscow's invading troops are actually Russian. ""Last night we sent the Ukrainian armed forces 24 Uragan missiles that were on their way here to fly over our cities,"" says Yuri Golodov, the deputy commander of one of Ukraine's Territorial Forces and a retired seaman from the Ukrainian Navy. ""We captured them intact, gave them to the Armed Forces of Ukraine at night and now the Ukrainian army has fired missiles back at them,"" Golodov says. Golodov plays a key role in repurposing military equipment abandoned by the Russian army -- or captured from it. He leads a team working at a military junkyard at an undisclosed location in Kyiv, repairing and repainting Russian military equipment for use by Ukrainian forces. ""Everything that we take away from the Russian army, we transfer to the armed forces of Ukraine,"" he says. A second life for damaged weapons When CNN visited the junkyard, Ukrainian forces were stripping bare an artillery support vehicle, used to spot targets. The Ukrainian flag had been painted over Russian military symbols, and Golodov's unit was removing communications equipment before sending it back onto the front line. ""We're going to use it to transport the wounded,"" he says, adding it will make an ""important"" contribution to Ukraine's war effort. ""This is a very proper cross-country vehicle. It can cope with any swamp or snow."" Much of the equipment used by the Russian military is similar or the same to that used by Ukrainian soldiers, so they're familiar with its operation. ""It dates back to the Soviet Union,"" Golodov says. ""It is quite reliable."" ""Everything is in working condition. It looks old weaponry, but actually if you use it correctly it will serve us for a long time,"" he adds. Golodov says his battalion is also responsible for capturing some of the equipment in the yard. ""We are special forces battalion of deep reconnaissance which works behind enemy lines,"" he explains. ""Our task is to destroy the provision of the Russian army -- ammunition, fuel, food."" Weapons seized from troops under fire Around the corner, a former Russian army fuel truck is ready to be redeployed and, under the cover of a camouflage blanket, a captured armored personnel carrier awaits its next assignment. It is old, rusty and heavy Soviet era machinery that breaks the pavement, as members of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces move it around, but the soldiers here say they will put it to good use. According to Golodov, the vehicle was captured by his unit, when they attacked a Russian column. ""We shot at the first vehicle, and when it exploded the column stopped,"" he says. ""(Russian soldiers) ran away and we took their military equipment."" According to Golodov and his men, this is a common occurrence on the battlefield. ""Russian soldiers are frightened, demoralized. They are afraid to part with each other, because they are being shot at from every bush,"" he says. He says some seem to be very young and inexperienced: ""Most of them do not know or understand why they are here."" Ukraine's Territorial Defense forces are equally green. Most didn't have any sort of military training before the Russian invasion, but the men say they are ready for battle. In another part of the facility, soldiers armed with AK-47s train for a possible encounter with Russian troops. They move in groups in an organized manner and seem unfazed when their commander fires blanks in their direction. Golodov looks on, proud. Before he retired from the navy, he says he spent time with the Soviet Union's north fleet in Mursmansk, northwestern Russia, and says he knows what Russian forces are capable of. He tells us he is not surprised by how well Ukraine has fared in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. ""The force of the Russian army is nothing more than a myth,"" he says, confident in a Ukrainian victory. ""How can someone possibly think otherwise?""",14,2.1054308569538502,6.562830370048081,-4.457399513094231,15
2022-03-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/politics/biden-russia-cyber-activity/index.html,Biden warns business leaders to prepare for Russian cyber attacks,"President Joe Biden on Monday issued an urgent warning to American business leaders, telling them to strengthen their companies' cyber defenses immediately. Speaking at the Business Roundtable Quarterly Meeting in Washington, Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to use cyber attacks as a form of retaliation against the United States for its actions to counter Russia's incursion on Ukraine. Biden said, ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming."" He added that ""one of the tools (Putin's) most likely to use, in my view -- in our view -- is cyber attacks. They have a very sophisticated cyber capability,"" and later argued, ""The point is that he has the capability. He hasn't used it yet, but it's part of his playbook."" The President told business leaders the national interest is at stake, suggesting that it's ""a patriotic obligation that you invest as much as you can in making sure -- and we will help in any way -- that you have built up your technological capacity to deal with cyber attacks."" Earlier Monday, Biden issued a statement pointing to ""evolving intelligence"" to suggest Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against American companies and critical infrastructure. While the Biden administration has been warning the nation of the prospect of cyber attacks by Russia for months, most recently as a response to the economic restrictions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, the President's statement suggests ""evolving intelligence"" has heightened the threat. The details of exactly what that intelligence is remain unclear, but deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger said during Monday's White House briefing that Russia had been conducting ""preparatory activity"" for cyber attacks, which she said could include scanning websites and hunting for software vulnerabilities. Neuberger said the administration is reiterating its warnings ""based on evolving threat intelligence that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyber attacks on critical infrastructure in the United States,"" but also underscored that ""there is no certainty there will be a cyber incident on critical infrastructure."" The administration last week ""hosted classified briefings with companies and sectors we felt would be most effective and provided very practical, focused advice,"" Neuberger told CNN's Phil Mattingly during Monday's briefing. Biden said in his statement that the administration would ""continue to use every tool to deter, disrupt, and if necessary, respond to cyber attacks against critical infrastructure,"" but acknowledged that ""the federal government can't defend against this threat alone."" ""Most of America's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and critical infrastructure owners and operators must accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has been actively working with organizations across critical infrastructure to rapidly share information and mitigation guidance to help protect their systems and networks,"" the statement said. The administration is recommending several steps to help private sector partners prevent against cyber attacks, including using multi-factor authentication, consulting with cyber security professionals to make sure systems are protected against all known vulnerabilities, changing passwords across networks to prevent stolen credentials from being used, backing up and encrypting data and educating employees on cyber security. Concerns that Putin might lash out The decision for Biden to issue the warning reflects concerns within the administration about what Putin might be willing to do next as it becomes increasingly clear his invasion of Ukraine is not going as expected, according to a US official familiar with the internal discussions on cyber security. Biden officials have been discussing how the state of Russia's ground campaign might change Putin's calculus and how options are being considered in Russia as a result, the official said, noting the situation -- in some ways -- is more volatile than ever. Russia still maintains its cyber capabilities and the administration believes Putin may be more willing to use those tools as he gets more desperate, the official added. The official would not provide details about the kinds of options for potential cyber attacks the US believes Russia may be exploring, but there has been an increase in observed activity, according to a source familiar with the situation. The official said it is difficult to determine whether this is just noisy Russian activity meant to send a message to the US about what it could do or actual preparation of the environment. ""If you're Russia, disinformation doesn't seem to be working, they're not going to fire a shot at us, and so what's left is something in the middle: cyber,"" a second official added. The US departments of Energy, Treasury and Homeland Security, among others, have briefed big electric utilities and banks on Russian hacking capabilities, and urged businesses to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious activity. The FBI has been wary that Russian speaking ransomware groups could lash out at US businesses. While the administration has issued warnings about possible Russian hacking activity for months, when the statement comes from the President, ""it's generally because [the threat] has taken on additional significance in the eyes of the government,"" a third US official said. Ukrainian government agencies have been hit by a series of cyber attacks before and after the Russian invasion but not the level of hacking that some analysts feared. Cyber attacks have nonetheless played a supporting role in the war. As the Russian military began attacking Ukraine on February 24, satellite modems that provide internet service for tens of thousands of customers in Europe, including some in Ukraine, were taken offline in a cyber attack on US telecommunications provider Viasat. The US government is investigating the hack of Viasat as a potential Russian state-sponsored cyber attack, a US official familiar with the matter previously told CNN. Neuberger on Monday did not identify who was responsible for the hack. She said US officials continue to investigate the incident. Earlier in March, a bipartisan group of senators also shared their concerns with the Biden administration about the potential of widespread Russian cyberattacks in the US as retribution for harsh sanctions against Russia in the wake of President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Sunday evening obtained by CNN, 22 senators, led by Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen and South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, raised questions about America's readiness for Russian cyber and disinformation threats. Additional correspondence obtained by CNN indicated that DHS responded to the senators on Monday, saying that the CISA's Office of Legislative Affairs will work with the group to prepare a briefing on the matter.",3,8.147841787559129,6.058880616122611,2.0889611714365177,23
2022-03-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/politics/russia-ukraine-negotiations-us-nato/index.html,US and NATO officials struggle to decipher status of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine,"US and NATO officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin has not backed off his original demands in talks with Ukraine, and there is a heavy dose of skepticism in Western capitals about how credible Moscow's engagement truly is -- even as the status of those negotiations remains difficult to decipher, according to multiple sources briefed on the situation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has recently indicated he is willing to consider some concessions to Russia to help bring an end to the violence, including a neutrality policy -- albeit one underpinned by robust security guarantees, raising more questions about the current state of talks and specific elements of any peace deal that may be under consideration. ""I'm ready for negotiations with (Putin). I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations, we cannot end this war,"" Zelensky told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an exclusive interview Sunday. But he warned that any failure of negotiation attempts fail could lead to ""a third World War."" Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have met four times since the start of Russia's invasion. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov weighed in on the possibility of Ukraine agreeing to neutral status during a media event in Moscow on Saturday. ""After our operation in Ukraine ends, and I hope its ends with a signing of a comprehensive agreement on the issues I mentioned -- security issues, Ukraine's neutral status with the guarantees of its security as (Putin), a couple of months ago as I recall, commented at a news conference on our initiative of non-expansion of NATO, he said we understood every country needs guarantees of its security,"" said Lavrov. But details on negotiations remain scant with many NATO countries, including the US, remaining on the outside looking in when it comes to the secretive talks, with one European defense official calling negotiations ""a bit of a dark avenue right now."" The Biden administration still sees no indication that Putin is willing or ready to deescalate the conflict -- making it difficult for US officials to be optimistic about the current state of negotiations, one source familiar with the situation said. But at the same time, this source also said that the US is not pressuring Ukraine to accept or reject specific concessions and is not involved in the negotiation process. The US National Security Council declined to comment. Russian demands Some of the terms Ukraine has said it may be willing to consider seem more feasible than others, but at the end of the day, NATO countries are still skeptical of Russia's engagement. ""It is very close hold, and no one really knows what's going on,"" the European defense official said. ""Ukraine's positions haven't changed -- ceasefire, withdrawal of troops and security guarantees."" ""Anyone who says they know something about the status of the talks, (they) really don't,"" the official added. Putin laid out several issues to achieve a ceasefire with Ukraine in a Thursday phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to Turkish presidential spokesman İbrahim Kalin. ""The first is Ukraine's neutrality,"" Kalin said in an interview with the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet published Saturday, adding that would mean Ukraine agreeing to not become a NATO member. ""Second, disarmament and mutual security guarantees in the context of the Austrian model. Third, the process that the Russian side refers to as 'de-Nazification.' Fourth, removing obstacles to the widespread use of Russian language in Ukraine. It is understood that some progress has been made in the first four articles of the ongoing negotiations. It is too early to say that there is full agreement or that an agreement is about to be signed."" Kalin said Putin had additional demands that were ""the most difficult issues"" -- the recognition of the annexation of Crimea and the two so-called republics in Donbas. Kalin said these final two issues ""are not acceptable demands for Ukraine and the international community."" ""If a point is reached in the first four articles and an agreement is reached, there can be a discussion at the leaders' level regarding the fifth and sixth articles,"" Kalin said in the interview, adding that if the negotiations take place, ""it may be possible to reach an agreement and end the war."" US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield on Sunday declined to set terms on what the US would or would not accept when it came to an agreement between Ukraine and Russia to end the fighting. ""This is for the Ukrainians themselves to decide what is too much for them. It is not our decision on that and we support their efforts. So I can't preview what they will end up coming up in their negotiations with the Russians,"" she told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" Asked by Tapper again, if the US would recognize Crimea or Donbas as a part of Russia should that be a part of the agreement, Thomas-Greenfield again declined to answer. ""I can't say that at the moment. We certainly have not recognized the independent Donbas regions just declared as independent. But I can't review how we will respond to a negotiated settlement that the Ukrainians come up with the Russians to save the lives of their own people."" The lack of clarity about the status of negotiations is raising additional questions about what Ukraine is willing to agree to and how Russia's demands would be implemented if they ultimately reach some sort of agreement. Zelenksky said Saturday there were ""compromises"" his country could not make in negotiations with Putin. ""Any compromises related to our territorial integrity and our sovereignty and the Ukrainian people have spoken about it, they have not greeted Russian soldiers with a bunch of flowers, they have greeted them with bravery, they have greeted them with weapons in their hands,"" he told CNN's Zakaria when asked about the Russian demands. ""You cannot just make a president of another country to recognize anything by the use of force,"" he added. Many details of Russia's demands, whether Ukraine would accept them and how Ukraine would even implement them remain unclear, a senior NATO official said. That includes what it would mean for Ukraine to adopt a ""neutral"" status with the West -- a possibility that one congressional source told CNN has caused heartburn for US officials. ""Does that mean they forswear NATO? Does that mean they forswear the (European Union)? Can they not have any other external assistance?"" the NATO official said. ""My sense is it's going to be a very complex negotiation."" Neutrality policy A European diplomat told CNN last week that if Ukraine were to adopt a neutrality policy and also demilitarize, it would effectively be a surrender -- calling such a move ""Moscow-style neutrality."" The Kremlin has floated the notion that Kyiv could adopt a Swedish or Austrian neutrality policy. However, a Swedish diplomat dismissed the notion of Swedish neutrality, saying the idea that their country is neutral is not true and attempts to try to frame it as such are consistent with longstanding Russian efforts to misrepresent Sweden's national security policy. ""Whenever the term 'Austrian neutrality' comes up, it has to be remembered that this is a model of an armed neutrality. This form of neutrality doesn't mean that a country lies down its arms and hopes that nobody attacks it. It's a neutrality where a country -- at least in theory -- is armed and ready to defend itself against all foreign belligerents,"" said Martin Weiss, Austria's ambassador to the US. The NATO official added that it is unclear what kind of agreement Russia and Ukraine might come to about the territory Russia has taken control of since invading on February 24. The official said the ""hope"" expressed by both Russian and Ukrainian officials in recent days appears to be belied by the fact that ""some pretty clear differences remain"" between the parties. ""I think we just need to be mindful that the Russians almost certainly will seek to continue to resupply and will probably continue to fight, up until the time that things are agreed,"" the official said. ""Whatever the solution, if there's diplomatic resolution and there's an agreement, it has to be clear and binding. And it has to be monitorable. ... People will be looking to ensure that the Russians end the war conclusively. And there isn't some lingering threat that remains."" While the source familiar with the Biden administration's view of the talks told CNN that some of the terms Ukraine has said it may be willing to consider seem more feasible than others, the source also indicated that the US will be wary of Russia's intentions until Putin shows some signs that he is ready to deescalate.",29,4.545433900845863,4.369290782990365,0.17614311785549752,26
2022-03-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-20-intl/index.html,School where hundreds were believed to be sheltering is bombed in Mariupol as fighting rages for key port city,"An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol has said officials in the besieged Ukrainian city are struggling to find out exactly how many people survived after an art school was bombed by Russian forces on Sunday morning. ""So far, there is no exact operational data on how many people were hiding in the shelter or the number of casualties,"" Petro Andrushenko said in a social media post. ""I expect we will have it later today. But the situation is difficult and there is nowhere to get the data from."" Earlier, the city council said the building was acting as a shelter for an estimated 400 people. The information black hole reflects a similar lack of clarity about how many people survived an attack four days ago on a theater in Mariupol that was also being used as a shelter, possibly for up to 1,300 people. The number of people reported to have survived that bombing -- put at 130 -- has been unchanged for several days. It is indicative of the almost total collapse of basic services and communications in a city that is increasingly bearing the brunt of Russia's fierce assault on the country. ""The city continues to be shelled both from the sky and the sea,"" Andrushenko wrote on his Telegram channel Sunday. ""It seems the occupiers are so eager to wipe out Mariupol that they are ready to cover themselves with fire."" Four of the seven established humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol were operational on Sunday, according to Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, and almost 7,300 people were evacuated. Among them, 3,900 people were evacuated by buses and private transport from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine government and city officials rejected a call by the Russian Ministry of Defense for Mariupol authorities to surrender the city to Russian forces by 5 a.m. local time Monday, a move reported by the Russian state media outlet, RIA Novosti. ""There can be no discussion of any surrender or of laying down arms,"" said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk in an interview late Sunday. ""I have already informed the Russian side about it. I wrote: 'Instead of wasting your time to write an 8-page letter -- open the corridor,'"" Vereshchuk said, adding Ukraine has informed the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross and is ""awaiting a response from the international community. This is a conscious manipulation and true hostage taking."" Russia was offering to open humanitarian corridors to the city by 10 a.m. Monday and ""wants to receive a written response from Kiev to these proposals before 5:00,"" RIA Novosti reported, citing the head of Russia's National Center for Defense Management, Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev. ""From 10 am to 12 o'clock - for all armed units of Ukraine and foreign mercenaries is a temporary suspension of fighting along the route agreed with Ukraine. From 12 o'clock, there will be a simultaneous passage of humanitarian convoys with food, medicine and basic necessities,"" Mizintsev said, according to the report. Andrushenko said people trying to flee the city in their cars were being shot at by Russian forces. ""Evacuation is difficult -- difficult but moving. The Russians are doing everything to complicate things. Last night, cars trying to drive towards the village of Melekine [6 miles west of the city center] were fired upon."" Other residents looking to flee were having their cars seized from them at a checkpoint just outside Mariupol, he said. Meanwhile, Mariupol City Council said in a statement on Saturday night that residents of the city were being taken to Russian territories against their will by Russian forces. ""Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents have been taken to Russian territory. The occupiers illegally took people from the Livoberezhny district and from the shelter in the sports club building, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing,"" the statement read. According to Colonel-General Mizintsev almost 60,000 residents of Mariupol ""found themselves in Russia in complete safety,"" RIA Novosti reported. The city council said captured Mariupol residents were taken to camps where Russian forces checked their phones and documents, then redirected some of the residents to remote cities in Russia -- adding that the ""fate of the others is unknown."" The statement quoted Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko saying, ""What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people."" Oleg Nikolenko, Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, called Russia's action's in Mariupol on Sunday a ""chapter from WWII."" ""First they came to destroy the cities, bombing hospitals, theaters, schools, and shelters, killing civilians and children. Then they forcibly relocated the scared, exhausted people to the invader's land. A chapter from WWII? No -- the actions of the Russian army, today in Mariupol,"" Nikolenko tweeted. Three weeks of fighting have left much of Mariupol in ruins, with shopping centers, apartment blocks and infrastructure all severely damaged. Local officials estimate 80% of properties are damaged.",17,6.63292399696197,3.0618964441662144,3.5710275527957553,1

""I'm ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,"" he told CNN's Fareed Zakaria. ""I think that we have to use any format, any chance in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War,"" he added. Zelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia's invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks ""without delay,"" warning that otherwise Russia's losses would be ""huge."" ""We have always insisted on negotiations. We have always offered dialogue, offered solutions for peace,"" he said. ""And I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. It's time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine."" Zelensky has previously said that his priorities in the talks are clear: ""The end of the war, security guarantees, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country."" Zelensky also told Zakaria on Sunday that if Ukraine ""were a NATO member, a war wouldn't have started."" ""I'd like to receive security guarantees for my country, for my people. If NATO members are ready to see us in the alliance, then do it immediately. Because people are dying on a daily basis,"" he said, while also adding that he was grateful for the aid NATO has provided since the invasion began. Still, last week, Zelensky dropped his clearest hint yet that he does not expect his country to join NATO anytime soon, something that has been a Ukrainian goal. NATO, a security alliance currently made up of 30 North American and European nations, was created in 1949 in response to the start of the Cold War. Its original purpose was to protect the West from the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Since the end of the Cold War, many former Soviet satellite states and three former Soviet republics have joined NATO, meaning Russia now shares a land border with the world's largest military alliance. 'We are trying to defend our sovereignty' Asked how he is holding up amid the war, Zelensky told CNN that he was ""doing just everything that everyone else in Ukraine is doing."" ""We have made up our team to defend our country, so it seems to me that the person does not need to turn into anyone else. That is important when you can be just yourself,"" he said. ""So I am holding up quite well,"" he added. Zelensky also admitted that as of now his weakest point is losing people and children in these ""huge numbers."" ""I go to sleep with this information about children who were killed and we are continuing to pray in order to prevent new losses of people, but so far we haven't attained these results,"" he said, adding that ""we are trying to defend our sovereignty, defend our country."" The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said Sunday that since the start of the war, 11 girls and 25 boys have been killed. Asked about Putin's claims that the Ukrainian government is full of neo-Nazis, Zelensky told Zakaria that it shows that the Russian President ""might be capable of very horrendous steps."" ""I'm not afraid of anything except for people, but the fact -- the fact is that if he is serious about this statement, he might be capable of very horrendous steps because that would mean that this is not a game for him,"" Zelensky said.

Earlier Saturday, a Ukrainian army commander told CNN that people in Mariupol risk their lives each time they emerge from underground bunkers and claimed the strategic port is facing the most intense fighting anywhere in the country. With Russia's assault in its fourth week, Major Denis Prokopenko, from the National Guard Azov Regiment, told CNN that air and land attacks on the city were now almost relentless. ""Usually, Mariupol is under fire during the whole day and night. Sometimes there (are) 30 minutes of silence, but then the city is again under attack (from) tanks, artillery, multiple rockets, and (aircraft) like bombers and helicopters,"" he said. More than 4,100 people, including 1,172 children, were evacuated Saturday from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia via humanitarian corridors, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior official in President Volodymyr Zelensky's office. Mariupol has been under siege for several weeks and has seen some of the worst attacks in the war since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February. These have included deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater, the losses from which are still unknown as the rescue operation continues. The city lies on a stretch of coast connecting the eastern region of Donbas with the Crimea peninsula, both of which have been under Russian control since 2014. Russian forces appear to be trying to take full control of the area to create a land corridor between the two regions, squeezing Mariupol with brutal military force. Russia has denied targeting civilians in Mariupol, blaming casualties on Ukrainian forces. Prokopenko said people in the city were now reluctant to leave their underground shelters even to get hold of essentials, meaning they were trying to drink less water and eat less food, only emerging to prepare hot meals. ""People are cooking food in the streets, risking their lives under the continuous shelling and bombing,"" the military commander said. ""The temperature is minus 5 degrees Celsius in the street."" Basic services like gas, electricity and water, are all out in the city. Bodies are being left in the street because there is either no one left to collect them, or it is simply too dangerous to try. Prokopenko said no one knew the exact number of people killed. ""Some people are buried under ruined buildings, buried alive,"" he said. Information about a huge attack three days ago on a theater in Mariupol being used as a shelter has been slow to emerge. An image taken Saturday by the Maxar satellite imagery provider shows about two-thirds of the Mariupol Drama Theater completely destroyed, with just the western facade still standing. The building, which also acted as the city's main humanitarian assembly station, was providing a temporary home to 800 to 1,300 people when it was hit, according to local officials. Still clearly visible in the picture is the Russian word for ""children"" painted in large letters on the ground in front of the entrance. He confirmed earlier reports that sustained Russian artillery fire made attempts to get survivors out of the building very difficult. Communications in the besieged city have been difficult for days and rescue work has been hampered by the danger of near-continuous shelling, according to reports from inside the city. Initial reports suggested many survivors had to dig themselves out of the rubble. Figures released by several Ukrainian leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, say 130 people have been rescued, among them one person with serious injuries. During a video call with the Ukrainian Minister of Culture Oleksandr Tkachenko on Friday, Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini offered to help rebuild the Mariupol Drama Theater. Zelensky thanked Franceschini on Twitter Wednesday saying that Italy ""set a good example to follow. Together we will rebuild the country to the last brick.""",17,3.317236940284469,6.002020565309829,-2.6847836250253603,1
2022-03-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/19/politics/russian-cosmonauts-ukraine-international-space-station/index.html,Russian cosmonauts spark speculation after arriving at International Space Station in Ukraine's colors,"A trio of Russian cosmonauts arrived Friday at the International Space Station wearing bright yellow flight suits trimmed with blue, raising questions about whether the three were showing solidarity with Ukraine by wearing its national colors and rebuking their own government's invasion. While it is possible that the suits are a sign of solidarity with Ukraine, there are also other possible explanations. Some have speculated the three may have instead been paying homage to Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which they all attended and which has blue and yellow among its school colors. The head of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, posted pictures on Telegram of media coverage speculating the cosmonauts were supporting Ukraine, and said, ""Here some bandit cowards and their Anglo-Saxon sponsors don't know what else to come up with in their information war against Russia."" He added that the crew were not representing Ukraine but wearing colors from their alma mater: Bauman Moscow State Technical University. ""Sometimes the color yellow is just the color yellow. The flight suits of the new crew were designed to match the colors of the emblem of Bauman Moscow State Technical University, from where all three cosmonauts graduated. The design of the uniforms was coordinated long before the current events. Seeing the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is just a clinic [in propaganda],"" another Roscosmos official wrote in his Telegram channel ""Closed Space."" Cosmonauts typically pick their flight suits months in advance, which would predate Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But it's unclear when the cosmonauts selected this yellow and blue color scheme. ""For Soyuz flights, typically the crew meets with the company that makes the suits months before flight and they are allowed two custom suits,"" a NASA astronaut who has flown on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS told CNN. ""Typically, one suit is the same across the crew, and the second suit is something personal."" ""I think it would be a real challenge to make and launch these (flight suits) last minute. Not impossible though,"" a former NASA astronaut who has also flown on a Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS said. When the three cosmonauts arrived at the space station Friday, they spoke to callers on the phone, one of whom asked about the yellow color. Commander Oleg Artemyev responded jokingly, ""We actually had a lot of yellow material, so we had to use it. So that's why we had to wear yellow."" Veteran former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who has been a staunch critic of Russia's invasion, noted the uniforms in a tweet, written in Russian and English: ""Three Russian cosmonauts who have just docked at the International Space Station have arrived in Ukrainian yellow!"" Cosmonauts Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov will spend the next six and a half months aboard the space station. When the hatch opened at 5:48 p.m. ET Friday, the three were welcomed aboard the ISS by two other Russian cosmonauts, four NASA astronauts, and one European Space Agency astronaut. The crew were all smiles and embraced one another after the new arrivals floated through the hatch in their bright yellow suits.",3,4.919437122006713,7.530510243262644,-2.6110731212559317,11
2022-03-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/18/europe/lviv-ukraine-attack-russia-importance-intl/index.html,Russia has attacked Lviv. Here's why the western city is so important to Ukraine's defense,"Russia launched missile strikes near an airport in Lviv on Friday, a strategic Ukrainian city not far from the Polish border that had until now largely been spared from the relentless bombardment witnessed across much of the country during the war. Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovyi said several missiles hit an aircraft repair plant, but that work at the facility had stopped before the strikes and there were no reports of casualties. Ukraine's armed forces say initial information suggests Russia launched six missiles towards Lviv on Friday morning. It says the missiles were most likely air-launched cruise missiles fired from warplanes over the Black Sea. Two of the six were intercepted by air defense systems, the armed forces' statement on Facebook said. The attack will add to concerns that Russia's war could spread further west. Here's what you need to know about the importance of Lviv. Location At about 43 miles (70 kilometers) from Poland's border, Lviv is at NATO's doorstep — so if attacks are ramped up here, it could have international repercussions. Friday's attack comes after Russia launched a barrage of missiles at the Yavoriv military base, located between Lviv and the Polish border, on Sunday, killing at least 35 people. Refugees Lviv has become a safe haven for Ukrainians fleeing other war-torn parts of the country. It hosts more than 200,000 internally displaced people in a city of just over 700,000, according to the mayor. They've flooded into Lviv in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the border. Logistics The larger region serves also as a crucial weapons supply route to the Ukrainian military and a wider resistance effort that has foiled Moscow's plans for a blitz-like invasion. Western Ukraine's supply lanes have become even more important as Russia chokes off sea passages and lays siege to the country's south. To the north is Belarus, which hosts Russian troops and has been one of the launching pads of the invasion. Culture and history Lviv's historic center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the National Museum houses the country's most complete collection of sacred medieval art and rare religious manuscripts. According to the city's official website, Lviv was the site of Ukraine's first mass actions in support of independence when communism collapsed. On September 17, 1989 Lviv became the site of the largest demonstration in support of revival of Ukraine's independence, with 100,000 participants. The Act on State Independence of Ukraine was passed on August 24, 1991 and hundreds of people flooded the streets of Lviv in celebrations the following day. ""Being an indisputable capital of Ukrainian culture, spirituality and national identity, Lviv has always played a major role in the development of democracy and struggle for Ukraine's independence,"" the website states. Lviv was once part of the Hapsburg monarchy -- then known as Lemberg -- but became the real stronghold of Ukrainian national resistance during Soviet times, according to the country's official tourism site. Details on UNESCO's site describe how Lviv, founded in the late Middle Ages, became a flourishing administrative, religious and commercial center for several centuries. Up until the invasion, the medieval urban topography, as well as the city's many fine Baroque and later buildings, were well preserved, according to UNESCO. UNESCO said earlier this month it was in permanent contact with all relevant institutions across Ukraine, as well as with Ukrainian cultural professionals, to assess the situation and to reinforce the protection of cultural properties. At the start of the conflict Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General, said: ""We must safeguard the cultural heritage in Ukraine as a testimony of the past, but also as a catalyst for peace and cohesion for the future, which the international community has a duty to protect and preserve."" Temporary base The city has also become the makeshift home for many media organizations and embassies, which were forced to relocate from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.",17,6.238508798013048,5.17283617501633,1.0656726229967184,10
2022-03-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/europe/russian-casualties-ukraine-military-readiness/index.html,Mounting Russian casualties in Ukraine lead to more questions about its military readiness,"Thousands of Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began nearly one month ago, US and NATO officials told CNN this week, and Russia is now struggling to resupply those forces as it faces sagging troop morale and fierce Ukrainian resistance. Russia's offensive to capture Kyiv has largely stalled, NATO officials said, and on Thursday Ukraine said it launched a counteroffensive aimed at gaining decisive control of the city's suburbs. US and allied intelligence assessments vary widely as to exactly how many Russian forces have been killed to date, sources familiar with the intelligence tell CNN. But even the lowest estimates are in the thousands. One such assessment found that approximately 7,000 Russian troops have been killed so far, said one of the sources. But that figure, first reported by The New York Times, is on the higher end of US estimates, which vary because the US and its allies have no precise way of counting casualties. Some estimates place the number of Russian troops killed in Ukraine at about 3,000, whereas others suggest more than 10,000 have been killed. So far, the number has been calculated largely via open source reporting from non-governmental organizations, the Ukrainian government, commercial satellite imagery, and intercepted Russian communications. US officials have also extrapolated numbers of dead based on the number of Russian tanks that have been destroyed, the sources said. Regardless of the precise number, US and western intelligence officials have observed that Russia is having difficulty replacing its forces, which is having a significant impact on Russian troop morale, senior NATO officials said on Wednesday. ""It becomes more evident every day that Putin gravely miscalculated,"" a senior NATO intelligence official told reporters at NATO headquarters on Wednesday night, speaking on the condition of anonymity to disclose sensitive assessments. ""Russia continues to face difficulties replacing its combat losses, and increasingly seeks to leverage irregular forces, including Russian private military corporations and Syrian fighters."" A senior NATO military official echoed that assessment, saying that ""we can assess that more private military companies will be engaging"" in the conflict soon. But in general, he said, the losses have had ""a bad effect on the morale of the troops."" ""We can see [Putin] miscalculated the resilience and the resistance of the Ukrainians,"" the NATO military official said. ""That is a fact. He did not see that. And that is a big surprise for him. And therefore he has had to slow down."" Flagging Russian morale The NATO intelligence official added, citing the Ukrainian General Staff, that ""Russian servicemen are increasingly refusing to travel to Ukraine, despite promises of veteran status and even higher salaries."" He noted that NATO expects that ""the reportedly high Russian casualties will also stir some reaction in Russia, as the Russian people eventually become aware of the extent of their losses."" A senior US defense official told reporters Thursday that the Pentagon has anecdotal evidence that Russian morale is flagging. ""We don't have insight into every unit and every indication. But we certainly have picked up anecdotal indications that morale is not high in some units,"" the official said. ""Some of that is, we believe, a function of poor leadership, lack of information that the troops are getting about their missions and objectives, and I think disillusionment from being resisted as fiercely as they have been."" In some instances, Russian troops have simply abandoned broken down vehicles in the field, walking away and leaving behind tanks and armored personnel carriers, according to two US officials. A congressional source briefed on the intelligence similarly said the US has assessed that there appears to be a gap between what Russian troops were prepared for and what they actually encountered. Many Russians captured so far have said they did not expect, for example, that they would be fighting a war in Ukraine, and believed they were just part of a military exercise. The Russian military leaders' commitment, however, appears to still be high, the congressional source said. Last week, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told a congressional committee in a public hearing that the US intelligence community's assessment of Russian troop deaths was between 2,000 and 4,000. He said the assessment was made with low confidence and based on both intelligence sources and open-source material. US and western intelligence officials broadly acknowledge that the will to fight is often difficult to measure and it is unclear how much sagging morale has contributed to Russia's sluggish progress on the battlefield. But open-source reporting for weeks has documented signs of discontent and low morale amongst ground troops, and one official speculated that one of the reasons Russian generals have been operating in higher-risk, forward operating positions is an effort to gin up flagging troops. Western officials say at least three Russian generals have been killed by Ukrainian forces since the war began. The problem may also extend to Russia's elite air units, the official said. ""They've lost a bunch of planes,"" this person said. ""That really affects pilot morale."" Russia is also behind in its desired timeline, the senior NATO military official said on Wednesday. Putin was hoping to expand Russian control over Ukraine all the way west to the Moldovan border by now, the official said, in order to link up with more Russian troops and attempt to encircle Kyiv. There are pro-Russian troops stationed in Transnistria -- a breakaway state in Moldova -- who ""are in a way, prepared"" to join the war, the official said. But they have not yet done so because the regular Russian forces have not yet made substantial progress westward, he said. Despite all of the losses, the senior NATO intelligence official said the alliance considers that Putin is still ""unlikely to be deterred, and may instead escalate. He likely remains confident that Russia can militarily defeat Ukraine.""",14,4.219420901774504,7.097069762866816,-2.877648861092312,12
2022-03-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/europe/ukraine-mariupol-bombing-theater-russia-intl/index.html,Survivors emerge from rubble of Mariupol theater bombed by Russia,"People sheltering in a theater in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol are emerging from the building after it was bombed, the former head of the Donetsk region said Thursday. Hundreds of people were thought to have taken shelter in the theater amid the ongoing Russian siege of Mariupol. Russian forces have bombarded the coastal city for weeks, trapping hundreds of thousands of people. Ukrainian officials estimates 2,500 civilians have died in the fighting. ""After an awful night of not knowing, we finally have good news from Mariupol on the morning of the 22nd day of the war. The bomb shelter [of the theatre] was able to hold. The rubble is beginning to be cleared. People are coming out alive,"" the former Donetsk region head Sergiy Taruta wrote in a Facebook post Thursday. He later told Ukrainian television that rescue efforts were being hindered by the complete breakdown of social services in the city and the dangers of further Russian attacks. It was not yet clear whether all those who sheltered in the theater had survived. Taruta said on Thursday that 1,300 people were in the building when it was bombed and 130 have so far been rescued. ""People are doing everything themselves. My friends went to help, but due to constant shelling it was not safe. People are clearing away the rubble themselves. There is no rescue operation, because all the services that are supposed to rescue people, to treat them, to bury them, these services no longer exist,"" Taruta told Ukrainian television. Liudmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian Parliament's commissioner for Human Rights, said earlier on Thursday that adults and children were coming out alive but the full extent of the impact remained unclear. ""In Mariupol, the release of civilians from the rubble of the drama theater has begun. The building withstood the impact of a high-powered air bomb and protected the lives of people hiding in the bomb shelter. Work is underway to unlock the basement,"" Denisova said in a statement on Telegram. However, she said there was ""currently no information about the dead or wounded under the rubble of the theater,"" and called the attack ""an act of genocide and a terrible crime against humanity as defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."" After the bombing on Wednesday, Mariupol City Council shared an image of the building and said Russian forces had ""purposefully and cynically destroyed the Drama Theater in the heart of Mariupol."" The word ""children"" was spelled out on two sides of the theater before it was bombed, according to satellite images. Ukraine's Minister of Defense Oleskii Reznikov said on Thursday that the Russian who carried out the bombing was a ""monster,"" and stressed the presence of children in the building. ""You can see from the maps, from the drones that around this theater, big letters of 'children' were written so that the pilot of the plane which was throwing the bombs could see 'children', and still, in spite of that, this monster has bombed the theater,"" Reznikov told the European Parliament via video link. Russia has denied its forces hit the building and instead accused ""militants of the nationalist 'Azov' battalion"" of blowing up the theater. The Azov battalion started as a volunteer militia linked to far-right ideologies before it was incorporated into a Ukrainian National Guard unit in 2014. Maxim Kach, a Mariupol city government official, said the building was for civilians, with only women and young children hiding within it and not military personnel, while an adviser to the government said it was the largest shelter in Mariupol. The onslaught on the city has led to a desperate humanitarian crisis. More than 350,000 residents continue to hide in shelters and basements to escape the ""continuous shelling by Russian occupation forces,"" with an average of 50 to 100 air strikes hitting the city each day causing enormous destruction, its city council said Thursday on Telegram. It estimates about ""80% of the city's housing structures are destroyed and 30% irreparably lost."" Residents who escaped the city told CNN conditions were ""unbearable"" and ""hell,"" with constant shelling, reports of people being held captive in a hospital and residents left without water, electricity or heat. Earlier this week a pregnant woman and her newborn baby died after a maternity hospital in Mariupol was bombed. CNN earlier reported that at least three people -- including a child -- died following the attack last week. Previous attempts to evacuate Mariupol have failed, but a planned evacuation went ahead on Thursday, with 800 private cars with more than 2,000 people making it through Russian-occupied territory to the city of Zaporizhzhia by mid-evening, according to Iryna Vereshchuk, the Ukrainian Minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories. A total of 30,000 people have managed to leave the besieged city, the city's council said Thursday.",17,7.3496877976452275,8.017781275822635,-0.6680934781774077,1

The ExoMars Rover, a collaboration between ESA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos, had been on track to leave for Mars in September this year. But ESA said last month that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had made that ""very unlikely."" The decision to suspend cooperation with Roscosmos on the project was made unanimously by ESA's ruling council, which met in Paris on Wednesday and Thursday to assess the situation arising from the war in Ukraine. The council said it had authorized a study to see whether there were any options ""for a way forward"" for the mission. Launch windows are delicate and timely for missions heading to Mars from Earth. The rover, known as both ExoMars and Rosalind Franklin in honor of the English chemist and DNA pioneer, was initially scheduled to launch in July 2020 but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. The space agency said in a statement that it deeply deplored ""the human casualties and tragic consequences of the aggression towards Ukraine. While recognising the impact on scientific exploration of space, ESA is fully aligned with the sanctions imposed on Russia by its Member States."" The mission is intended to search for life on Mars and investigate the history of water on the red planet. The rover has the capability to drill beneath the surface of Mars to a depth of 6.5 feet (2 meters), where the scientists hope they may find signs of life. Despite suspending the Mars mission, ESA said that the International Space Station program continues to operate as planned. ""The main goal is to continue safe operations of the ISS, including maintaining the safety of the crew."" There are currently four NASA astronauts, two Russian cosmonauts and one European astronaut living and working on board the orbiting outpost. On Friday, three more Russian cosmonauts are expected to arrive. The mounting geopolitical tensions have seen retired US astronaut Scott Kelly clash on Twitter with the head of the Russian space agency. Such conflicts are ""damaging"" to the space station's mission, a NASA official has warned. The agency said it's still working closely with Roscosmos, and NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei will ""for sure"" return from the space station later this month aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft as previously planned. In light of the situation in Ukraine, the ESA will convene an extraordinary session of the space agency's ruling council in the coming weeks, the statement said.",3,8.442627829689824,8.08328681545667,0.3593410142331539,11
2022-03-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/politics/russia-military-ukraine-what-matters/index.html,Russia seems to have a very bad army. That's not good for Ukrainian civilians,"The accounts of Russia's military issues and ineptitude during its three-week-long invasion of Ukraine are too numerous to list. The proof of Russia's military problems is in a video of Russian tanks, stuck in a line, being destroyed by Ukrainians -- and in reports of Russian combat deaths, which already may be anywhere from 3,000 to more than 10,000. If those death tolls are toward the higher end -- and we really don't know -- it has been noted that would mean Russian deaths to date could be more than US military combat deaths during 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan combined, although the total death tolls from those conflicts were far greater than just US military deaths. There are numerous accounts of Russian soldiers surprised to learn they had been sent to war. CNN spoke with Russians held as prisoners of war in Ukraine. Nearly a dozen POWs have appeared in news conferences -- public appearances that may be questionable under the Geneva Conventions, which forbid countries from unnecessarily humiliating POWs. Soldiers with regret CNN decided to publish interviews with captured Russian pilots. CNN had the only journalists in the room and at no time did Ukrainian Security Services, which also was in the room throughout, interject or direct CNN or the prisoners to ask or answer specific questions. The interview was conducted in Russian. One, a pilot named Maxim, became emotional with anger and regret at what Russia has done. ""It's not just about demilitarizing Ukraine or the defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but now cities of peaceful civilians are being destroyed,"" Maxim said. ""Even, I don't know, what can justify, f**k, the tears of a child, or even worse, the deaths of innocent people, children."" There are reports of Russian soldiers who were surprised to learn they had invaded a country rather than taken part in a training exercise. Others have abandoned their posts. Why did Russia's army perform so poorly? Among the most detailed and engaging analyses cataloging Russia's foibles is an excellent conversation between retired Gen. David Petraeus, who formerly headed the CIA and commanded US forces in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the journalist Peter Bergen. Read it here via CNN Opinion. Petraeus praised the determination of the Ukrainians: ""They are fighting for their national survival, their homeland and their way of life, and they have the home-field advantage, knowing the terrain and communities."" But he also described the Russian army's shortcomings, which begin with the fact that some portion of it -- a quarter, according to one estimate -- is made up of conscripts rather than professional soldiers. The US, too, has a selective service for all American men in case a draft is ever needed. But while the American draft has been dormant since Vietnam, young Russian men may serve one-year rotations in the military. That's barely enough to get them out of basic training and into a unit, Petraeus said. The Russians have had problems with intelligence, communications and vehicles getting stuck in traffic jams, stuck in the mud and breaking down. ""So in every single area of evaluation, the Russians, starting with their intelligence assessments and understanding of the battlefield and their adversary, and then every aspect of the campaign, all the way down to small unit operations, have proved woefully inadequate,"" Petraeus argued. While they have up to 150,000 troops involved in Ukraine, that's not nearly enough to occupy Kyiv, much less the entire country, he said. An incapable Russian army is not entirely good news ""Failing militaries can be even more dangerous than successful ones,"" writes Kori Schake, director of foreign and defense policy at the American Enterprise Institute, in The Washington Post. It is exactly their incompetence that could make this war so devastating, she argues. ""There's reason to worry that the ineptitude and lack of professionalism that Russian forces have displayed in the first three weeks of the conflict are making fighting considerably more brutal for civilians than a more competent military would — and increasing the prospects that the war escalates."" The strategy is now to terrorize Retired Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt was asked Thursday on CNN about the seemingly indiscriminate use of imprecise weapons in civilian areas, something he said must be intentional. ""Their job is to terrorize the population. They're trying to make sure that the cities are shelled, that the people see this kind of shock and they want the city to capitulate. They want to surround it. They want to shell it. They want to starve it, and the Russians then will storm it. This is intentional, and whether these (are) dumb bombs or precision weapons, it doesn't matter."" Photos of a bombed theater housing children seeking refuge in the city of Mariupol, a bombed maternity ward and bombed apartment buildings have renewed calls for war crimes prosecutions. But they are also evidence of desperation on the part of the Russians. ""To me, as a layman, I am not haggling over war crimes because that's clearly what the Russians have resorted to,"" James Clapper, former director of national intelligence, said Thursday on CNN. ""And the reason for it, of course, is the fact they essentially failed in a conventional, tactical attack, so they're resorting to what they can do, which is wanton destruction and the killing of innocent civilians."" Fear can work both ways Clearly, from the accounts of captured soldiers, this war caught many Russians by surprise. Ukrainians can build that into their defense strategy. ""What Ukrainians need to do is instill fear in the heads of every soldier that around the corner is some civilian or some member of the military who is going to attack them,"" Evelyn Farkas, a Pentagon official during the Obama administration, said Thursday on CNN. Calling in reinforcements Petraeus said it was unclear to him how the Russians could rotate their soldiers out of combat roles given their stalled supply lines and their level of commitment. One indicator may be in a report from the Japanese Ministry of Defense, which told the US it saw Russian ships from the Asian side of the country traveling with combat vehicles, perhaps to reinforce the Ukraine front.",14,5.440336306512022,3.258639253794477,2.181697052717545,24
2022-03-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/europe/nordic-defense-ukraine-crisis-intl-cmd/index.html,Nordic countries wonder if they are next on Putin's list,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has done more to unify Western Europe than almost any event since the end of World War II. Nations that were neutral have provided arms for Ukrainians; governments that had for years missed their NATO defense spending obligations have made spectacular U-turns; and countries that had deep economic ties to Russia have gone further in breaking the link than anyone had seriously envisaged little over a month ago. The West's almost unprecedented unity on sanctions, political and military action has left many in Europe, despite the horrors of Putin's war, optimistic that the continent will emerge from this better equipped to deal with security threats. Nowhere is this truer than in the three Nordic nations that sit on the Scandinavian Peninsula: Norway, Sweden and Finland. The fate of these three countries has been brought into sharp focus by the crisis in Ukraine due to their unique relationship with each other, the rest of Europe and Russia. Both Norway and Finland share land borders with Russia, though Norway's is significantly smaller at under 124 miles, compared to Finland's 800-mile frontier. Norway, the Western-most of the three, is a member of NATO but is not in the European Union, while Finland and Sweden are in the EU, but not in NATO. All three have historically supported a non-confrontational approach to Russia since the breakup of the Soviet Union due to their proximity. Also, all three are also members of the EU's Schengen area, meaning there is borderless travel between the three countries. It's these last two facts that have played a significant role in the major rethink of European security over the past three weeks: How can you have a policy of non-confrontation when you also simultaneously share an open land mass with Russia? One senior European defense official told CNN that ""if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, then we are already asking the question of who is next?"" They added that, due to the open borders between the three, any compromise of the Finnish border would ""traumatic"" for the peninsula. Active conversations, once viewed by Sweden and Finland as a risky act of provocation against Russia, are now taking place in both countries about joining NATO. And, along with their neighbor Norway, both are throwing non-confrontation out the window. ""Finland and Sweden suddenly breaking long-held position(s) not to export arms to war zones and sending supplies to Ukraine has been the biggest shock for Europeans in terms of the Nordic response -- and I suspect for Putin,"" said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a leading researcher in global security at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. He anticipates that we could see bolder moves yet from the three due to commitments made in the Nordic Defence Cooperation (NORDEFCO) Vision 2025 paper, which sets out plans for closer military cooperation between five Nordic nations who have different relations with NATO and the EU. ""If suddenly Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland are storing weapons and units in other countries and coordinating their action, then we are in the territory of hard security operating across EU and NATO borders, which will really make life harder for Russia,"" Salonius-Pasternak said. The severity and robustness of the Nordic has response has raised the prospect of Finland joining NATO. Alexander Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, believes that joining NATO is a lot more likely because Putin has wrecked the careful balance Finland had maintained for years. ""Strategically, we always wanted to keep joining NATO in our back pocket as a deterrent to stop Russia from aggressive behavior. We maintained the balance of our military being compatible with NATO, while not being members of the alliance,"" Stubb told CNN. However, he believes that Putin's actions have made that balance impossible. ""Finland is driven by what I call rational fear. We can see Russia's aggression and we don't want to get left alone as we were in World War II."" While joining NATO would be a major statement, there is an argument to be made that it makes little difference in a world where there is such universal revulsion at Putin's actions. ""For years, Finland and Sweden had been taking action to mitigate the fact they were not in NATO by strengthening ties with the US, UK and the rest of the transatlantic community,"" says Håkon Lunde Saxi, an associate professor at the Norwegian Defence University College. He says that things like NORDEFCO and Nordic nations cooperating more closely on security make the region less vulnerable in a way that, in some respects, transcends membership of EU and NATO. ""The most powerful message of the past few weeks has been the unity,"" Saxi said. ""First, Denmark and Sweden sent lethal equipment to Ukraine, then Finland and Norway followed suit. The urgency of the situation is ensuring that this kind of cooperation is accelerating, which makes protecting ourselves against any opponent more possible,"" he added. It must be hard for Putin and his accomplices to fathom, but their barbaric war in Ukraine has galvanized parts of Europe that had once bent over backwards to accommodate Russia into previously unthinkable action. Whenever the horror ends, he might wake up to a very different Europe that is almost unrecognizable to the one he'd been able to bully with gas and rhetoric. And some of the most vocal opponents might be waiting right on his doorstep.",29,4.83227111204341,4.925640809302915,-0.09336969725950528,9
2022-03-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/politics/russia-us-cyberattack-infrastructure-invs/index.html,"US has 'significant' cyber vulnerabilities, but a sweeping Russian cyberattack is unlikely","In the winter of 2015, computer hackers working for the Russian government attacked Ukraine's power grid and switched off the lights and heat to more than 200,000 consumers. Last year, a cybercriminal group with operatives in Russia launched a successful ransomware attack on a key East Coast pipeline that forced the company, Colonial Pipeline, to temporarily close the spigot and pay 75 bitcoins -- or $4.4 million -- to bring it back online. It was the largest cyberattack on an oil facility in US history. And it was a Russian government lab that built tools used in one of the most dangerous cyber offensives in the history of the digital age, penetrating the control systems of a Saudi petrochemical plant in 2017 for the purpose of setting off an explosion that, had it succeeded, could have killed people. So established is Russia's reputation for cyber sabotage that on February 24 -- as its troops began rolling into Ukraine -- President Joe Biden issued a warning to the country and its autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin. ""If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,"" he said during remarks from the White House. But now, even as the Russian army drops bombs and mortar shells on civilians in hospitals and neighborhoods and its invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week, no known nightmare cyber scenario --- a widespread power outage, a poisoned water system, a crippled supply chain -- has come to pass in Ukraine, the US or elsewhere. To be sure, a ripple of smaller cyberattacks ricocheted through the websites of Ukrainian banks and government agencies just before the invasion, and larger attacks may still be in store for the besieged country of 43 million people. But the general consensus among the nearly 20 experts who spoke with CNN for this story is that while Russia is well positioned to launch catastrophic cyberattacks on the US, it is not likely to do so. ""We do need to consider this possibility as a low probability but high-impact scenario,"" said Paul Prudhomme, the head of threat intelligence advisory at the cybersecurity firm IntSights. The prospects for a grand-scale cyberattack in America are low, experts say. For one, Putin understands that his country's cyber capabilities, though formidable, are outmatched by those of the United States, which is generally thought to be the most sophisticated player in the domain. The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told CNN it hasn't yet received any credible cyber threats resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, but it emphasized that the energy sector has been bolstering its defenses in recent years and is on high alert as it urgently prepares for any attempted breach. Experts say Russia's ability to conduct an impactful cyberattack in the US shouldn't be underestimated. ""If we look at just what they've been able to do, there is only, according to public knowledge, one country out there that has any experience taking down electric systems -- that's Russia,"" said Robert M. Lee, a cybersecurity expert who investigated the 2015 attack in Ukraine. Testing the waters Cyberattacks against the US by Russia are more than merely possible -- they've been happening for years on a low-grade scale. The country has been testing the waters in the US, laying the groundwork, experts say, for a much more extensive cyber campaign. For instance, in 2018, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that a group of state-sponsored hackers from Russia had compromised the networks of multiple US electric utilities the year prior and allowed intruders to gather detailed information on the control systems that US electric utilities use to power American communities. That same year, the Department of Justice announced the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers for carrying out large-scale cyber operations against the Democratic Party in advance of the 2016 presidential election. Then, in late 2020, came the most advanced cyber-op yet: About 100 organizations around the world -- including multiple US government agencies -- were revealed to have been breached by Russian hackers who compromised the software provider SolarWinds and exploited their access to monitor internal operations and withdraw data. Putin has been systematically testing vulnerabilities in Europe and the US for the past four years, and is in a position to cause all sorts of economy-crushing problems, experts say. ""They know how to weaponize these things -- they've done it,"" said Melissa Hathaway, who led cybersecurity initiatives in the presidential administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ""If I need to cause a national crisis in another country, they know how to do this, they've systematically been testing the system."" Prudhomme said a stealthy Russian hacking group called Energetic Bear -- which has been tied to Moscow's Federal Security Service, or FSB -- is the most likely Russian third-party, state-sponsored actor to execute any high-level attack. The group, which industry analysts refer to by several aliases, including ""Dragonfly"" and ""Berserk Bear,"" has carried out a number of successful hacks in recent years. In 2017, it targeted a nuclear power plant in Kansas in what cybersecurity experts refer to as a ""watering hole""-type attack -- a practice where hackers place malicious links on websites frequently visited by employees. ""The group has a history of gaining access and maintaining access to US and European utility companies, but they don't do anything with it,"" Prudhomme said. ""They want to have that access ready at a moment's notice so, if and when they get the order on demand, they can flip the switch."" In 2020, another state-sponsored Russian group identified by analysts as Cozy Bear, believed to be within Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, likely orchestrated the SolarWinds hack. US officials said the group used SolarWinds software to breach internal email systems at the US Treasury and Commerce departments, among other key agencies, in what was one of the largest-ever cyber attacks. But it's a two-way street. Experts say that while it's true Russians are lurking in the software of various structural areas, Americans are also lurking in theirs. It's the ""cyber equivalent of mutually assured destruction,"" said Karen Walsh, CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Allegro Solutions, using a term that historically described a philosophy of deterrence during the nuclear standoff of the Cold War. And the Americans, experts say, are currently the more capable threat. While Russian cyberattacks tend to attract headlines, experts told CNN, the most sophisticated hacks are often carried out in a more professionalized manner by countries such as the US and Israel, which are good at hiding their tracks. One secret operation that spilled into public view in 2010 was known as Stuxnet, in which the US and Israel are widely believed to have jointly sabotaged a nuclear facility in Iran with a computer virus that temporarily hampered the country's nuclear program. Putin, experts say, understands the extent of this sophistication and is likely loath to poke the bear. ""He seems to recognize that that's a different level of escalation,"" Timothy Frye, Columbia professor and author of ""Weak Strongman: The Limits of Power in Putin's Russia,"" said of a crippling cyberattack on a major electric utility in the US or another NATO country. ""That might be part of the calculations as well."" Still, some experts say, Europe's critical infrastructure could be an enticing target for Russia. That's in part because the continent is far more dependent on Russian oil than the US is. ""I don't think anyone's thought through how much control Russia has over the future of Europe,"" said Hathaway, now the president of Hathaway Global Strategies. Putin has been most willing to wreak havoc on the Ukrainian power grid, which the Russians also hacked in 2016 -- just a year after shutting off power to more than 200,000 consumers. Lee said the second attack -- which reportedly took out about a fifth of the power consumption in Kyiv for an hour -- was by far the more impressive of the two. ""That one scared the hell out of everybody,"" said Lee, now CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Dragos and a former cyber warfare specialist with the Air Force. ""That was a capability they developed that could be deployed on any electric transmission site in the world and have reliable effects everywhere. Like, it was -- it was bad."" The United States and the United Kingdom also have blamed the NotPetya hack of 2017 -- which the Trump administration called ""the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history"" -- on Russia. The NotPetya attack was launched against a Ukrainian accounting software firm, but the malware spread to companies across the globe, resulting in billions of dollars in damage. ""It was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in 2018. Some experts say the extensive meddling in Ukraine is due in part to how the country is seen as a kind of testing ground for belligerent cyberactivity. This is because the country's power grid is in some ways similar in structure to those in the US and other Western countries, but Ukraine's ability to retaliate has historically been minimal. Still, the US has seen a rise in high-profile cyberattacks. The growing threat prompted Biden to issue an executive order in May to shore up the nation's cybersecurity and protect federal government networks. And it is a reminder that cyber defense in the United States has troubling vulnerabilities. The US has 'significant' cyber vulnerabilities If the Colonial Pipeline breach demonstrated anything, it is the extent to which critical infrastructure in America is susceptible to cyberattacks. That event in May prompted the Georgia-based company to shut down the pipeline for the first time in its 57-year history. The six-day shutdown scrambled logistics for several airlines and caused a panic at the pump that led to shortages and briefly raised gas prices. But while it was allegedly carried out by a Russian hacker group called DarkSide, authorities haven't been able to link it to the Kremlin. (In fact, the Russian domestic intelligence agency arrested the alleged culprit -- though the hacker was not extradited.) The ordeal ended when Colonial ponied up the $4.4 million ransom — more than half of which was later recovered by the Justice Department. That attack, Prudhomme stressed, was financially motivated. The hackers, he said, used a compromised password found in a dark-web data dump and were able to employ an inactive VPN account to penetrate the Colonial Pipeline's network, which didn't use multifactor authenticati",3,5.789697664799587,6.435760134499499,-0.6460624696999115,23
2022-03-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-16-intl/index.html,Attacks on civilians intensify as Ukraine and Russia say negotiations indicate progress,"Ukrainians face an increasingly desperate situation on the ground as Russian forces hit the capital and fresh targets across the country, despite both nations acknowledging signs of progress in ongoing negotiations. A theater where hundreds of people had taken shelter in the besieged southern city of Mariupol was bombed on Wednesday, according to local authorities, as hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in the coastal Ukrainian city that has been encircled for weeks by Russian forces. The word ""children"" was spelled out on two sides of the theater before it was struck, according to satellite images. Northern cities have come under increased attack, including the capital Kyiv, with two people injured in the shelling of a 12-story residential building early Wednesday. In the nearby Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, at least 10 people queueing for bread were killed when Russian forces shelled it on Wednesday, a local official, Vyacheslav Chaus, told Ukrainian television. He said the attack was indicative of Russia's use of indirect fire against civilians. Despite this, Russian forces are still ""generally stalled"" near Kyiv, and have not ""made any significant advances"" towards the city from the north, northwest or east of the city, a senior US defense official told reporters Wednesday. As the Russian assault intensifies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that Russia's negotiating position in talks between the two countries was becoming ""more realistic,"" a sentiment reiterated by Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who suggested there was ""a certain hope for reaching a compromise,"" in a televised interview to Russian media outlet RBK. But while the United States welcomes ""the sentiments expressed that there is hope, that there is optimism for diplomatic progress,"" it believes Russia must de-escalate for any such progress to actually be achieved, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Wednesday. Deteriorating situation in 'hell' of Mariupol Russian military strikes continue to bombard Mariupol, which has been besieged by Russian forces since the beginning of March. Petro Andruishchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, described the bombed theater as the largest shelter ""in number and size"" in the city's center. ""According to preliminary data, more than a thousand people were hiding there,"" he said. ""The probability of getting there to dismantle the rubble is low due to constant shelling and bombing of the city."" The bombing adds to the city's growing humanitarian crisis. About 350,000 people are trapped in the city and as many as 2,500 civilians have died, Ukrainian officials estimate. Those who remain are without electricity, water and heat. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies Monday showed the extent of the damage in Mariupol, including homes smoldering after apparently suffering Russian strikes, a destroyed apartment complex and rising plumes of thick smoke. After weeks of failed attempts to establish safe civilian evacuation corridors, about 20,000 people managed to leave the city on Tuesday, officials say. And on Wednesday, more than 3,000 cars transporting evacuees from Mariupol arrived in the central Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, the head of the regional administration, Oleksandr Starukh, said on his Telegram channel. However, Russian forces also attacked Zaporizhzhia for the first time on Wednesday, hitting a railway station and the area around the botanical garden, Starukh added. In another southern coastal city, the Ukrainian government said it staged a rescue of the mayor of Russian-occupied Melitopol, who was detained by armed men in the city on March 11. Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was freed as part of a prisoner swap, Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security said in a statement on Wednesday. According to the statement, Fedorov was exchanged for nine Russian soldiers, which the Ukrainians say are ""conscripts,"" born between 2002-2003. Russia has denied sending conscripts to Ukraine. Since Fedorov's detention, newly installed mayor Galina Danilchenko ordered the broadcasting of Russian television channels and attempted to dissolve the city council and instead create a People's Committee. Later Wednesday, a senior advisor to Zelensky said the Ukrainian army is beginning to counterstrike Russian forces in a number of directions. ""This fact is drastically changing the dispositions of the sides,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said in a statement posted to Telegram, adding that the ""Russian administration is trying to find allies whose soldiers would be ready to die on the field."" NATO 'not as essential' Amid signs of potential progress in Ukrainian-Russian talks, the Kremlin said Wednesday that President Vladimir Putin hadn't spoken to his US counterpart, Joe Biden, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, but contact between the two leaders can resume if necessary. Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian negotiating delegation, was quoted Wednesday as saying the talks were ""difficult"" and ""slow,"" and that Moscow's objectives in negotiations with Ukraine have not changed. Medinsky was quoted by state media RIA Novosti on Wednesday as saying Moscow wants a ""peaceful, free, independent and neutral"" Ukraine. He added that the country should not be a member of NATO or any military bloc. Putin sees NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act. This week, Zelensky appeared to shift away from his previous demand for NATO membership for Ukraine The Ukrainian President delivered an impassioned speech to members of Congress on Wednesday via videolink, receiving a bipartisan standing ovation both before and after his statement. Showing a graphic video of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, Zelensky repeated his calls for a no-fly zone in Ukraine and made references to Mount Rushmore, the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. ""In the darkest time for our country, for the whole Europe, I call on you to do more,"" Zelensky said. ""New packages of sanctions are needed, constantly, every week until the Russian military machine stops. Restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based."" Olha Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, told CNN the reason why Zelensky did not mention NATO is because it is ""not as essential"" as a no-fly zone and weapons -- and that political aspirations will have to go on hold for now. ""I think that NATO is something which is not as essential as a no-fly zone and more weapons and basically, capability to defend ourselves,"" she told CNN from a secure location in Kyiv. ""But now basically it's not about politics, it's about survival,"" she added. Stefanishyna said Putin is failing in the war because ""the chain of command which disinforms him, and the senior management around, shows that they know nothing about our nation."" ""I'm absolutely sure that he's uncomfortable in every moment that he's sitting in his bomb shelter,"" she said, adding, ""he fails in each of his assessments."" While US officials say the White House does not support instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine or supplying the Ukrainian Air Force with new fighter aircraft, Biden appeared to shift his stance on Putin. ""I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden said to reporters after remarks at the White House on Wednesday. He and other government officials had previously stopped short of saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used.",17,4.6634665365724315,2.5469580550149273,2.116508481557504,1

""The plane dropped a bomb on a building where hundreds of peaceful Mariupol residents were hiding,"" it said. CNN has geolocated the image and confirmed it is of the theater in the southeastern port city. The word ""children"" was spelled out on two sides of the theater before it was bombed, according to satellite images. Videos of the aftermath showed a fire raging in the theater's ruins. The number of casualties is unknown, authorities said. ""It is still impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act, because the city continues to shell residential areas,"" the council wrote on Telegram. ""It is known that after the bombing, the central part of the Drama Theater was destroyed, and the entrance to the bomb shelter in the building was destroyed,"" it added. Petro Andruishchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, described the theater as the largest shelter ""in number and size"" in the city's center. ""More than a thousand people were hiding there"" but ""the probability of getting there to dismantle the rubble is low due to constant shelling and bombing of the city,"" he said. Military strikes also hit a building that houses the Neptune Pool, just over four kilometers (approximately 2.5 miles) from the theater, according to videos shared by a local official. Its authenticity has been confirmed by CNN. Maxim Kach, a Mariupol city government official, said the building was for civilians, with only women and young children hiding within it and not military personnel. He said rescue workers were busy trying to get a pregnant woman out from under the rubble. CNN has not been able to verify that information. Mariupol has been besieged by Russian forces since March 1. After weeks of failed attempts to establish safe civilian evacuation corridors, about 20,000 people managed to leave the city on Tuesday, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said. Officials say its trapped residents have been surviving without electricity, water and food, with people melting snow or dismantling heating systems for a drop to drink. The relentless bombardment and street fights in the city have restricted movements. The day before, a Ukrainian official accused Russian troops of holding some 400 people captive at Mariupol's Regional Intensive Care Hospital. ""It is impossible to find words that could describe the level of cruelty and cynicism with which the Russian occupiers are destroying the civilian population of the Ukrainian city by the sea. Women, children, and the elderly remain in the enemy's sights. These are completely unarmed peaceful people,"" the city council said. ""We will never forgive and never forget,"" it added. The unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Mariupol has enraged local officials. ""These bastards are trying [to] physically destroy Mariupol and the people of Mariupol, which have been a symbol of our resistance,"" Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of Donetsk region administration, said on Facebook Wednesday. He says the ""fate is unknown"" of the hundreds of people sheltering in the theater ""as the entrance to the bomb shelter is blocked by rubble,"" he said. ""The Russians are already lying, [saying] that the headquarters of the Azov Regiment was there. But they themselves are well aware that there were only civilians,"" he said. After Russia bombed a maternity hospital on March 9, its Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov alleged without evidence that the hospital was the ultra-nationalist militia Azov battalion's base and that all patients and nurses had left. A Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson later denied in a briefing that Russia had shelled the maternity hospital at all, calling it a ""provocation."" Mariupol has been reduced to a battle zone, with the city's deputy mayor telling CNN on Tuesday that Russia has been bombarding the city with missiles, saying that they counted 22 aircraft on Monday ""which were bombing our city, and at least 100 bombs."" Residents who fled the city have described conditions there as ""unbearable"" and ""just hell."" On Tuesday, shocking drone footage and satellite photos showing rising plumes of thick smoke and destroyed buildings emerged, underscoring the sheer devastation wrought by the Russian bombardment.

The warning came in an email, obtained exclusively by CNN, that was sent to all former US astronauts last week from a current NASA official who urged caution before ""attacking our Russian partners."" The war in Ukraine has pushed some former NASA astronauts, including Kelly, to speak out against the head of Russia's space agency, and it's putting NASA in a tough spot as it works to preserve its 20-year partnership with the Russians at the International Space Station. ""As Americans, each of us enjoys freedom of speech and you are all empowered to speak your mind,"" the email reads. ""However, please know that as former NASA astronauts, your words carry additional weight and attacking our Russian partners is damaging to our current mission."" CNN obtained a copy of the email with the stipulation that the name of the high-ranking NASA official not be revealed. On the same day the email went out, Kelly, one of NASA's most famous former astronauts, was blocked on Twitter by Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin after Kelly criticized both Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Rogozin's repeated threats to pull out of the International Space Station. ""Get off, you moron!"" Rogozin said in a quickly deleted Tweet. ""Otherwise, the death of the International Space Station will be on your conscience."" ""Dimon, why did you delete this tweet?"" Kelly replied via Twitter in Russian. ""Don't want everyone to see what kind of child you are?"" Kelly told CNN in an interview last week that he felt compelled to speak out after Rogozin shared a Roscosmos-produced video showing two Russian cosmonauts floating inside the space station and waving goodbye to NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who is supposed to return to Earth with them on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on March 30. But after receiving the email from the NASA official, Kelly told CNN that he's decided to refrain from engaging in another Twitter fight with Rogozin, something he hinted at in an op-ed on Tuesday. ""Yes, I saw the email and backed off Rogozin. I didn't have to, but I respect NASA, NASA's position and the (official) that sent it,"" Kelly told CNN, though he intends to keep opposing the war in fluent Russian for his more than 5 million Twitter followers. NASA's position is that it wants the International Space Station to continue to be ""the flagship model for international cooperation."" ""For over 20 years, the International Space Station partnership has operated successfully, and nothing has changed in the last three weeks,"" Joel Montalbano, the manager of NASA's International Space Station program, said at a Monday news conference. ""We are aware of what's going on, but we are able to do our jobs to continue operations."" That includes the successful completion of a nearly seven-hour long spacewalk on Tuesday by NASA astronauts Kayla Barron and Raja Chari. While inside the space station, Vande Hei surpassed Kelly's record for the single longest spaceflight by a US astronaut. ""Congratulations!"" Kelly told Vande Hei on Twitter. ""Broken records indicate progress. Looking forward to seeing you safely home soon. Ad astra!"" Vande Hei, who launched to the space station in April 2021, is expected to log a total of 355 days in orbit by the time he returns to Earth on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft and lands in Kazakhstan. He'll travel home on a Gulfstream jet, as other US astronauts have before him. ""I can tell you, for sure, Mark is coming home on that Soyuz. We are in communication with our Russian colleagues. There's no fuzz on that,"" Montalbano said Monday. Despite tensions remaining white hot between the US and Russia on Earth, the International Space Station continues to be a beacon of diplomacy between the teams in mission control and the fliers on board. ""Are they aware of what's going on on Earth? Absolutely,"" Montalbano said. ""But the astronauts and cosmonauts are some of the most professional groups you'll ever see. They continue to operate well and there's really no tensions with the team. This is what they've been trained to do -- a job -- and they're up there doing that job."" NASA declined to specifically address the email, but NASA Administrator Bill Nelson acknowledged the ""substantial"" challenges that the agency is currently facing. ""Despite challenges on Earth -- and they are substantial -- NASA is committed to the seven astronauts and cosmonauts on board the International Space Station. NASA continues the working relationship with all our international partners to ensure their safety and the ongoing safe operations of the ISS,"" Nelson said.",3,8.617480682144079,7.91327747090266,0.7042032112414187,11

The suspect, whom the SBU did not identify, was accused of being on ""thousands"" of phone calls to Russian officials, including senior military officers and of sending text messages to Ukrainian officials suggesting that they surrender. The equipment seized was used to route Ukrainian mobile phone traffic to Russian networks, according to Victor Zhora, a senior cybersecurity official in the Ukrainian government. It's the latest development in the ongoing battle for communications networks in Ukraine as the Russian military continues to shell the capital of Kyiv. From Moscow to the front lines of the war in Ukraine, the ability to communicate to troops and citizens alike has been contested by suspected Russian and pro-Ukrainian hackers. Hackers last week caused outages at a Ukrainian internet service provider Triolan, which has customers in major cities. Triolan blamed ""the enemy,"" a reference to Russia, but did not provide evidence supporting that claim. Carmine Cicalese, former chief of cyberspace and information operations at US Army headquarters, said functional mobile phone networks are of particular importance to non-military personnel in Ukraine who are taking up arms against Russia and who do not have access to tactical communications equipment. More broadly, in war the ability to be able to communicate with friends and family is ""vital to maintaining morale,"" Cicalese, who is now president of cybersecurity firm Cyber Cic, LLC, told CNN. In a separate incident, satellite modems that provide internet service for tens of thousands of customers in Europe, including some in Ukraine, were taken offline in a cyberattack on February 24, around the time that Russian forces began attacking Ukraine, an official from the US telecommunications provider Viasat, which owns the affected network, told CNN. Zhora, the Ukrainian official who works at the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection, told reporters Tuesday that the satellite hack ""was a really huge loss in communications in the very beginning of the war."" The hack of the Viasat satellite network was a ""deliberate, isolated and external cyber event"" that a third-party cybersecurity firm and ""government partners"" are investigating, Viasat said in a statement. Chris Phillips, spokesperson for Viasat, told CNN in an email that the KA-SAT, the Viasat satellite network targeted in the hack, had been ""stabilized."" Phillips declined to specify how many customers had been affected by the incident, calling it a ""partial outage."" Reuters first reported on the scope of the Viasat hack and the US investigation. The US government is investigating the hack of Viasat as a potential Russian state-sponsored cyberattack, a US official familiar with the matter told CNN. The US National Security Agency is ""aware of reports of a potential cyber-attack that disconnected thousands of very small-aperture terminals that receive data to and from a satellite network,"" an NSA spokesperson told CNN. ""We continue to work with interagency partners and Allies to assess the scope and severity of the incident and make available any relevant expertise we possess.""",3,8.695332935278627,7.942383746992531,0.7529491882860953,23

Mariupol city council said on Tuesday that an estimated 2,000 private cars have been able to leave the city, and a further 2,000 vehicles are parked on the main route out of Mariupol as of 2 p.m. local time Tuesday. The departures took place despite the ongoing failure to formally establish safe corridors to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, which has been besieged since March 1. As many as 2,500 civilians have died in Mariupol, Ukrainian officials estimate. About 350,000 people are trapped in the city, with officials warning those who remain are without electricity, water and heat. Two women who managed to escape to the Zaporizhzhia region, about 140 miles away, on Monday told CNN about conditions in Mariupol and the frightening journey out. Lidiia, who did not give her surname due to safety concerns, told CNN that she decided to leave Mariupol after Russian bombardments started hitting closer to her home. ""We left the city under shelling -- there is no silence in Mariupol,"" the 34-year-old said. ""Today we talked to our neighbors, they said that the situation now is even worse, so no one knows whether people will be able to leave Mariupol today."" She said she had spent two weeks in a basement with about 60 other people, adding she only left occasionally to retrieve items from her apartment. Describing the journey out of the city, Lidiia said: ""We stopped several times and hid the children because the airplane was flying very low directly above us. We were afraid that we would come under fire. But it was no longer possible to stay in the city. Mariupol is now just hell."" Svitlana, who also did not give her surname over safety concerns, told CNN that she let 17 people shelter in her house after their homes were destroyed, and cooked soup in her garden using rainwater. ""When the war started, I didn't want to leave. But when shells began to fly overhead around the clock, it became unbearable to stay there,"" the 57-year-old said. ""My son stayed in Mariupol, I am very worried about him, but he decided to stay. I could not persuade him to leave."" Speaking about the conditions in Mariupol, Svitlana said: ""There are still many people left in the city. I told my neighbors that it is possible to leave, but they are afraid that everything is mined."" She added: ""Yesterday, the last grocery store in the city was bombed, I wonder how will people survive now?"" As the city is reduced into a battlezone, a Ukrainian official accused Russian troops on Tuesday of holding people captive at Mariupol's Regional Intensive Care Hospital, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Head of Donetsk regional administration, said doctors and patients were being held against their will, adding that one of the hospital employees managed to pass on information about what was happening. ""It is impossible to get out of the hospital. They shoot hard, we sit in the basement. Cars have not been able to drive to the hospital for two days. High-rise buildings around us are burning ... the Russians have rushed 400 people from neighboring buildings to our hospital. We can't leave,"" Kyrylenko said on his official Telegram channel, quoting the employee of the hospital. Kyrylenko said the hospital was ""practically destroyed"" several days ago, but that its staff and patients stayed in the basement where patients continue to be treated. Satellite images published by Maxar Technologies on Monday reveal the extent of the damage inflicted on the city, including the hospital and a number of apartment complexes. The hospital has a hole in its southern walls and debris can be seen scattered around, while the residential buildings show significant damage. Satellite photographs of the Primorskyi neighborhood, around a mile south of the hospital, show homes smoldering after apparently suffering Russian strikes. Drone footage which also emerged Monday shows a destroyed apartment complex and thick plumes of smoke rising over the west of the city. The video was posted on Telegram by the Azov Battalion, an ultra-nationalist militia that has since been integrated into the Ukrainian armed forces. CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the video. Multiple official attempts to establish safe corridors and evacuate civilians from Mariupol have failed in recent days. A large convoy of humanitarian aid that was meant to arrive on Sunday has still not reached the city as of Monday, according to officials. Some have resorted to melting snow and dismantling heating systems to get water to drink, said Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the city mayor, on Ukrainian television on Monday. ""Most of the people are staying in the basements and shelters in inhumane conditions. With no food, no water, no electricity, no heating,"" said Andriushchenko. Speaking on Monday, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in President Volodymyr Zelensky's Office, said that the bombardment of Mariupol has caused more than 2,500 deaths. CNN cannot independently verify these casualty figures. Also on Monday, Zelensky accused Russia of committing war crimes in its attacks on the city and other parts of the country. ""Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable. Responsibility for a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities is inevitable,"" he said. ""The whole world sees what is happening in Mariupol.""",17,5.572956061723823,2.148719295406411,3.424236766317412,1
2022-03-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/europe/lviv-attack-aftermath-russia-invasion-intl/index.html,Russia's attack at Poland's border shattered the image of calm in western Ukraine,"On the surface, the western Ukrainian city of Lviv does not look like a city on the edge of a war zone. The streets are bustling with people. Austro-Hungarian architecture recently painted in pale hues stretches for miles. The trams still run on time and most of the shops that first shuttered after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his February 24 invasion of Ukraine have once again opened their doors. Yet beneath the city's relaxed exterior lies a crucial nexus in the war effort against Moscow's brutal assault against the former Soviet Republic. Lviv hosts one of the country's highest concentrations of internally displaced people -- over 200,000 in a city of just over 700,000 people. At the same time, the larger region serves as a crucial weapons supply route to the Ukrainian military and a wider resistance effort that has foiled Moscow's plans for a blitz-like invasion. At 50 miles from the Polish border, the city is also at NATO's doorstep -- any attack here could have international repercussions. ""Attacks in western Ukraine are dangerous because it could affect Poland,"" said historian Yaroslav Hrytsak, who was sitting at a trendy coffee shop in the historic center of Lviv. ""This could turn the conflict into an international conflict."" Tensions are ramping up here, despite the hundreds of miles that separate the region from Russia, culminating in a Russian strike on a military base close to the Polish border on Sunday. Russia says it is targeting arms supply shipments. The US denies that the attack disrupted weapon transfers. Western Ukraine's supply lane has become even more important as Russia chokes off sea passages and lays siege to the country's south. To the north is Belarus, which hosts Russian troops and has been one of the launching pads of the invasion. To the east is Russia. ""At one time it looked like Putin wasn't going to touch this region,"" said Hrytsak. ""He believed that western territory is too toxic, too anti-Russian. He wanted this region to go to the devil."" ""Now this has changed. Now Putin wants all (of) Ukraine,"" he added. When Russian forces bombarded the military complex in the Lviv region, families in the city heard the booms and thuds of Putin's war for the first time, getting a tiny taste of the horrors their countrymen and women further east have experienced for nearly three weeks. Analysts believe an invasion of western Ukraine remains a long way off, especially since the resistance in central, southern and eastern Ukraine has repelled a significant occupation of the country. Still, the attack seemed to bring the war closer to an international showdown. At least 35 people were killed and 134 injured in Putin's most westerly Ukrainian target -- just 15 miles from Poland, a NATO member. The site of the attack -- the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security at Yavoriv -- is the biggest military training facility in western Ukraine. It was also where NATO has performed drills. US instructors trained Ukrainian soldiers there last month, leaving before the invasion began. Russia claimed to have killed 180 ""foreign mercenaries"" without providing proof. Ukrainian officials said there were no reports of foreign casualties in the attack and NATO has denied that any of its units are in Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities have been relatively tight-lipped about the details around the attack, which only seemed to underscore its significance. When a CNN team tried to report from the site of the attack, the military had cordoned off the area around six miles away from the base. Public access roads leading to the site were blocked. The CNN team saw several people, who identified themselves as volunteer foreign medics, dressed in camouflage disembark from a van near a military cordon. ""The key point here is that Putin doesn't believe he is fighting Ukrainians. He doesn't see Ukraine as a separate entity or a viable state,"" said Hrystak. ""He believes he is fighting America and NATO on Ukrainian soil.""",17,3.6262059839054577,2.9990523798014928,0.6271536041039649,10
2022-03-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/europe/what-happened-ukraine-weekend-03-14-intl/index.html,Five important things that happened in Ukraine over the weekend,"Almost three weeks after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, its forces are expanding their offensive to the west of the country. Here are five important developments from this weekend. Russian missiles kill dozens at military training center near Polish border At least 35 people were killed and 134 injured in a Russian missile strike on the Yavoriv military training base in western Ukraine early Sunday local time, Ukrainian authorities said. The base is located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Lviv and less than 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) from the Polish border. It's home to the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, which hosts training exercises with Western military personnel. On Sunday, Russia said up to 180 foreign mercenaries were killed by the strikes, but Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesperson Markiyan Lubkivsky told CNN the claims were ""pure Russian propaganda."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said there had been ""some damage"" to the facility, but the Pentagon was ""still assessing and talking to the Ukrainians"" about the extent of it. No American service members were at the training facility because they had all left weeks earlier, Kirby told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday. The strikes show increased Russian focus on the west of the country, he added. ""This is the third... facility or airfield that the Russians have struck in western Ukraine in just the last couple of days, so clearly, at least from an airstrike perspective, they're broadening their target sets,"" Kirby said. Explosions in Kyiv as Russian forces inch closer At least two people died and three more were hospitalized after a residential building in Obolon, a suburb of the capital, Kyiv, was hit by shelling early on Monday morning, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. Several heavy explosions also reverberated across Kyiv at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) Monday. They appear to have been caused by Ukrainian air-defense batteries aiming at either Russian aircraft or cruise missiles. Trails of smoke heading into the sky could be seen from central Kyiv. On Saturday, the UK Ministry of Defence said the bulk of Russian ground forces were now only 15.5 miles (25 kilometers) from the center of the Ukrainian capital. Thousands dead in Mariupol as conditions grow even worse More than 2,500 people have been killed by the Russian bombardment of the southern city of Mariupol, according to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in President Volodymyr Zelensky's office, and the humanitarian situation continues to worsen. ""The Russians are just wiping the city out,"" Arestovych said on Monday. A shipment of humanitarian supplies has been unable to reach the city due to heavy shelling, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said on Sunday. ""The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,"" Vereshchuk said. ""The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city."" On Sunday morning, a Mariupol resident recorded a video diary revealing the desperate situation for civilians. The footage, posted on Twitter, shows looted shops and people trying to cook outdoors in sub-zero temperatures. ""There's no humanitarian aid and will not be. The evacuation of peaceful people is impossible,"" the resident said. ""People are in a devastating situation. Water, food are coming to an end, people are forced to break into shops, in search for necessities."" Mass protests in occupied Kherson and accusations of treason in Melitopol The strategic city of Kherson in southern Ukraine has been occupied by Russian forces since March 3, but on Sunday hundreds of people took to the streets to protest the occupation. In recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for a ""Kherson People's Republic."" City mayor Ihor Kolykhaiev said the demonstration was ""a peaceful protest to show that the citizens' position is that Kherson is Ukraine."" Russian forces have been accused of abducting local Ukrainian officials in two other cities. On Friday, the mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, was seen on video being led away from a government building in the city by armed men. A short time later, the Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed that Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses and was under investigation. Galina Danilchenko was installed as the new mayor of the city, but Ukraine's prosecutor general has opened an investigation after a group of Melitopol City Council members issued a written statement on Sunday accusing her of ""the high crime of treason, for attempting to set up an occupying government in Melitopol."" Separately, Yevhen Matveyev, the mayor of Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia region, was abducted by Russian troops on Sunday, according to Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba. US-China talks scheduled after Moscow reportedly asks Beijing for military support in Ukraine Russia has asked China for military support, including drones, as well as economic assistance for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, according to conversations CNN had with two US officials. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development. It could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country, and provide a counterweight to the hefty Western sanctions imposed on Russia's economy. When asked by CNN about the reporting of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement: ""I've never heard of that."" The Russian embassy in the US did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. US and Chinese officials will meet in Rome on Monday for talks that experts say could have far-reaching consequences not only for the war in Ukraine, but for China's role in the world and its relationship with the West. The meeting, between China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, comes as concerns grow in the West that Beijing is not only siding with Russia by not condemning its aggression in Ukraine, but could take further steps to aid its strategic partner.",17,2.1211501775226385,2.1798433403644384,-0.05869316284179993,7
2022-03-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/europe/ukraine-russia-mayor-protests-intl/index.html,"Russia is trying to install pro-Kremlin officials in occupied cities, but Ukrainians are fighting back","Russia is facing new forms of resistance in the cities it has seized in Ukraine, where attempts to abduct and replace political leaders have been met with legal pushback and defiant public protests. Russian troops have detained the mayors of at least two regions, Ukrainian officials say, replacing one with a pro-Kremlin opposition member. Lawmakers in a third Russian-occupied city say the groundwork is being laid for a political coup. Despite overcoming significant Ukrainian military resistance to occupy the territories, attempts to oust local leaders have led to new difficulties for Moscow. Ukraine's prosecutor general has opened a treason investigation into Galina Danilchenko, the newly installed mayor of Russian-occupied Melitopol in southeastern Ukraine, after the city's elected mayor, Ivan Fedorov, was arrested by armed men on Friday. The move follows a plea on Sunday by the city's lawmakers for a criminal investigation of Danilchenko over what they called ""the high crime of treason, for attempting to set up an occupying government in Melitopol."" The city council accused Danilchenko -- who is a former member of the city council, according to the Zaporizhzhia regional administration's website -- of dissolving the city government and transferring its powers to a People's Deputies Committee. Danilchenko declared herself the local leader and immediately said in a televised address Sunday that ""Russian TV channels"" would begin broadcasting in the city, which has been occupied by Russia since the first days of the invasion. Her ascension was met by angry protests on Saturday, when several hundred people demonstrated outside the city hall, chanting ""Freedom for the Mayor"" and ""Fedorov."" The Russian-backed regional prosecutor of Luhansk, a separatist-controlled region nearly 300 miles from Melitopol, claimed the rationale for Fedorov's arrest was that he had committed terrorism offenses. A second mayor -- Yevhen Matveyev, the leader of Dniprorudne, a small city north of Melitopol -- was abducted by Russian troops on Sunday, according to Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba. ""Today, Russian war criminals abducted another democratically elected Ukrainian mayor, head of Dniprorudne Yevhen Matveyev. Getting zero local support, invaders turn to terror. I call on all states & international organizations to stop Russian terror against Ukraine and democracy,"" Kuleba tweeted on Sunday. CNN could not independently confirm the claim. And in the southern city of Kherson, a political battle is underway to prevent the occupied city from being transformed into a breakaway pro-Russian republic. Ihor Kolykhaiev, Kherson's mayor, has said mass protests show that ""Kherson is Ukraine"" and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city. Speaking in a video posted on Facebook on Sunday, Kolykhaiev said, ""the city is living in a normal mode, the City Council is working, all the deputies are at work, all the utility establishments are up and running. Kherson mayor's office has a flag waving in the front. Kherson is Ukraine."" Kherson has been occupied by Russian forces since March 3. In recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the ""Kherson People's Republic."" Earlier Sunday, hundreds of demonstrators flocked the streets of the Russian-occupied city to protest the suspected Russian plans. The mayor said it was a ""a peaceful protest to show that the citizens' position is that Kherson is Ukraine."" Alluding to reports of Russian political maneuvering, Kolykhaiev warned that there ""seem to be behind-the-scenes talks held, and the people who want to change the political structure of our country and the south of Ukraine are trying to influence this situation."" As Russian forces slowly encroach upon other major Ukrainian cities, the levels of defiance in occupied locations could signal a long and difficult battle for Moscow to consolidate political power, if it succeeds in its immediate military objectives. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation for Ukrainians in occupied cities continues to deteriorate. Kolykhaiev said Kherson had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources, less than two weeks into its occupation. He said the city ""can't receive humanitarian cargo. Food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of medications and insulin."" ""Our main weapon is unity,"" he said.",17,1.345178438499588,6.4726713266294045,-5.127492888129817,1
2022-03-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/politics/senators-homeland-security-cyberthreat-russia/index.html,Bipartisan group of senators push Mayorkas for details on US readiness for a Russian cyberthreat,"A bipartisan group of senators is sharing concern with the Biden administration about the potential of widespread Russian cyberattacks in the United States as retribution for harsh sanctions against Russia in the wake of President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Sunday evening obtained by CNN, 22 senators, led by Nevada Democrat Jacky Rosen and South Dakota Republican Mike Rounds, raised questions about America's readiness for Russian cyber and disinformation threats. ""Given Russia's history of disruptive cyber and disinformation activities, we are concerned that the United States may be targeted in retaliation for actions taken to impose costs on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine,"" the senators wrote. DHS did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The Biden administration has been on alert for potential Russian criminal or state-backed cyberattacks against critical infrastructure targets in the US -- a posture that Washington assumed months ago but that has grown more acute since Russia invaded Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month that the US is ""very much on guard"" for potential Russian cyberattacks in light of the war. While there have been several hacks of Ukrainian organizations, there have been no significant reports of the sort of high-impact cyberattacks on transportation or electric infrastructure that some have feared. In their letter, the group of senators requested a briefing from Mayorkas about what the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) -- which falls under DHS -- is doing to proactively defend against Russian state-sponsored threats and what sectors might be targeted. They also asked whether a strategy is in place if critical infrastructure is breached and how CISA is ""coordinating with international partners"" on the matter. For months, CISA, the White House and agencies including the Treasury Department have held briefings with key sectors like banking and energy on Russian cyber capabilities and the possibility for retaliation in cyberspace. According to CISA's website, there are currently no specific or credible cyber threats to the US. Russian government-linked hackers have a long track record of infiltrating US government agencies and probing US critical infrastructure. Last year, the Biden administration attributed a successful 2020 cyber-espionage campaign that exploited SolarWinds software to breach several government agencies to Russia's foreign intelligence service, SVR. Russian-speaking ransomware groups have also disrupted US critical infrastructure, most notably last year during the days-long shutdown of Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel transporter for the East Coast. In February, President Joe Biden designated DHS as the lead federal agency to coordinate domestic preparedness and response efforts related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Last month, CNN reported that a senior FBI cyber official warned American businesses and local governments to be vigilant about potential ransomware attacks.",3,8.979074525811894,8.43745844686064,0.5416160789512539,23
2022-03-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-13-intl-hnk/index.html,Dozens killed as Russian forces strike targets in western Ukraine,"Russia expanded its offensive to western Ukraine on Sunday, firing missiles near the city of Lviv and hitting a large military base close to the Polish border, reportedly killing dozens of people and drawing the war closer to the borders of a NATO country. The attack came the day after the Kremlin threatened to attack Western weapons shipments to Ukraine. As the invasion runs into its third week, the northwest city of Lviv has largely been spared from Russia's relentless bombardment. The picturesque city has instead become ground zero for displaced Ukrainians. Hundreds of thousands of them have flooded into the city in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the Polish border about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away. But Russia's war is moving closer to the cultural hub. Russian forces fired more than 30 missiles at Yavoriv military training ground on Sunday, according to Lviv's military administration. Located between Lviv and the Polish border, the military base has held joint drills with NATO and Western military personnel, including the United States. A witness, who was on the base when the strike happened, told CNN of hearing a ""sudden clap"" from a bomb shelter, adding that the explosion craters were 10 meters deep and there are fears people are under the rubble. Local authorities say 35 people were killed and 134 injured at the military base, in what Ukraine's Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov described as a ""terrorist attack"" on peace and security ""near the EU-NATO border."" There were no reports of foreign nationals among the casualties so far, say Ukraine defense officials. The strike came the day after Russia launched a missile attack in the northeastern city of Lutsk, only 70 miles from the Polish border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that it was only a matter of time before Russia's military assault on Ukraine expanded to members of NATO -- unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone in Ukraine. ""Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,"" Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page. ""Now, I repeat again, if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries."" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that the strikes on Lviv were a sign that the war was not going to plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,"" Sullivan said. A senior US official told CNN Sunday that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development in Russia's invasion, and could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country. When asked by CNN about reports of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, ""I've never heard of that."" As attacks on civilian areas continued throughout the weekend, a new round of Russian-Ukrainian talks has been set for Monday. Zelensky alluded to the talks in his remarks Sunday, saying his country's delegation ""has a clear task -- to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for."" US President Joe Biden spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday evening, according to a White House official. Macron had spoken to Putin on Saturday in a joint call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. American journalist killed in Ukraine Heavy fighting continued Sunday, with Britain's Ministry of Defense saying Russia was attempting to ""envelop"" Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as it advanced from Crimea westwards towards Odessa. Russian troops continue to focus on the capital Kyiv. Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin leader of Russia's Chechnya region, reportedly told Russian soldiers outside of Kyiv that the key task is to seize the capital, Russian state news network Russia 24 reported on Sunday. Amid a growing civilian toll in Ukraine, American journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to social media posts by Kyiv region police. Two other journalists were wounded by Russian troops, the police added. Renaud ""paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty, and ruthlessness of the aggressor,"" an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement on Telegram. The US State Department confirmed Renaud's death on Sunday. ""We are horrified that journalists and filmmakers—noncombatants—have been killed and injured in Ukraine by Kremlin forces,"" department spokesman Ned Price said on Twitter. ""This is yet another gruesome example of the Kremlin's indiscriminate actions."" Social media footage has emerged of a journalist identified as Juan Arredondo, a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, at Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv, in which he describes being shot at by Russian forces while driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city. The exact circumstances of the attack against the two journalists are yet to be determined. TIME released a statement Sunday saying Renaud was in the region working on a TIME Studios project on the global refugee crisis. ""We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud. As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,"" TIME Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and President and COO Ian Orefice in the statement. Ukrainians take to the streets to protest Ukrainians continue to protest Russian occupation. The southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces, saw the biggest protest since the invasion on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the streets to protest against suspected Russian plans to turn the southern Ukrainian oblast into a breakaway republic. Waving Ukrainian flags, the protesters chanted anti-Russian slogans, filled with expletives about Putin, according to videographer Artem Ivanov, who is on the ground in Kherson. Ihor Kolykhaiev, the mayor of Kherson, said in a video posted on Facebook Sunday that mass protests show ""Kherson is Ukraine"" and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city. But the mayor also said that the city had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources. He said that the city ""can't receive a humanitarian cargo here, food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of the medications and insulin."" ""Our main weapon is unity,"" he added. In recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the ""Kherson People's Republic."" If true, the move would mirror Moscow's establishment of two Russian-backed breakaway states in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Putin recognized the independence of those two territories in the days leading up to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine as part of his pretext to launch an assault on the country. School demolished by Russian strike Russia's air offensive on Sunday also bore down on heavily populated areas around the country. Nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment in Mykolaiv Sunday, local officials said. The strategic southern city has resisted Russian occupation and impeded an apparent push towards the major port of Odessa to the west. A school in the village of Zelenogai, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Mykolaiv, was demolished by a Russian military strike, Mykolaiv regional administrator Vitali Kim said. Kim said that the military strike left several people either dead or in critical condition. ""Some people got under the rubble and we are evacuating them,"" Kim said. Missiles also destroyed an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, while the northern city of Chernihiv was struck for the third night in a row, hitting a high-rise building, the regional head, Vyacheslav Chaus, said. In the eastern region of Luhansk, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces, the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been ""massive shelling"" of several towns, including Kreminna and Rubizhne, which had prevented buses from leaving with civilians. The Ukrainian military thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows. The bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on March 10, appearing to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles. Ukrainian forces in Kyiv's suburb of Irpin have so far repelled the Russian forces' attempted advance towards the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by the Ukrainians, the river poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military. Also on Sunday, Ukraine's National Energy Company Ukrenergo completed repair work and resumed power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the company announced. The plant's electrical system was damaged during a Russian attack on March 9. Later on Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that the staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment. As the devastation mounts, Zelensky said the key task Sunday is to get the humanitarian convoy that is traveling towards the besieged city of Mariupol to its destination. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a week. Much of the city is without power and water. Mariupol's city administration confirmed Sunday night that the convoy was still stuck some 50 miles to the west. As the city waits, officials said it had suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours and ""to date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia."" Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that nine of the 14 evacuation routes declared Sunday had allowed civilians to escape fighting. About 3,950 people were rescued in the Kyiv region and 1,600 were able to escape from the Luhansk region in the east of the country, a",17,5.917210054822437,2.1435767862302786,3.7736332685921585,29
2022-03-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/politics/fact-check-russia-misinformation-ukraine/index.html,Fact Check: 5 times official Russian statements conflicted with intelligence and on the ground actions,"As its troops fight on the ground in Ukraine, Russia is waging a parallel war of misinformation. Even before Russian forces crossed the border, Russian officials were crafting a narrative at odds with reality. Publicly claiming one thing while intelligence suggests another isn't unusual, but Russia has gone so far as to insist its actions don't constitute war or that it has no plans to impose forces even while Russian troops set off explosions in key Ukrainian cities and attempt to gain control of strategic sites. Most recently following an attack on a hospital in Mariupol, a key city in the south of Ukraine, Russian officials have repeatedly changed their narrative. First, they stated Russia would never attack civilian targets, then claimed it was a false flag operation conducted by Ukrainian rebels, but they never took responsibility. Here are five examples of Russian officials essentially trying to gaslight Western officials and the broader public regarding Ukraine. Mariupol hospital Russian statements After the March 9 attack which wrecked Mariupol's maternity and children's hospital, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested civilians had not been present at the time. ""All the women in labor, all the nurses, in general, all the staff was driven out of there,"" Lavrov said on March 10. Reality Visibly pregnant women are present in videos and photos from the hospital after the attack. Mariupol's city council said children, women and doctors were among the 17 injured in the attack. Ukrainian officials say Russian forces were behind the attack, though Russian officials have insisted that's not the case. No attack Russian statements On March 10, Lavrov flat out denied Russia had attacked Ukraine, saying, ""Russia has no plans to attack other countries. We have not even attacked Ukraine."" Reality Lavrov's remarks came more than a week after Russia's initial invasion into Ukraine and as Russian forces attempted to seize control of several key Ukrainian cities. For example, authorities described the situation in Mariupol, which had been under siege from Russian forces, as ""critical"" due to heavy shelling. And a week before Lavrov insisted Russia had not attacked Ukraine, a Russian strike hit an apartment building in a city north of Kyiv, leaving at least 33 people dead. A limited operation Russian statements When Putin dispatched Russian troops into the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine on February 22, he initially described it as a ""peacekeeping"" mission. And in a TV broadcast early on the morning of February 24 after troops had invaded Ukraine, Putin referred to it as a ""special military operation,"" insisting it was limited to the Donbas region and stating that Russia does ""not plan to impose ourselves on anyone."" Reality Russia's presence in Ukraine is not limited. Their forces span most of the country, surrounding or attempting to surround key cities well beyond the Donbas. During and shortly after Putin's speech, reporters on the ground noted explosions could be heard in the capitol city of Kyiv as well as Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, and Odessa, a key port city -- none of which are in the Donbas region. That same day, Russian forces took control of Hostomel airport just outside of Ukraine's capital. In response to US aggression Russian statements Pushing back on reports of aggressive Russian troop positioning around Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov suggested in an interview on December 11 that any movements of Russian forces were in response to US military presence and movements in the region. ""Russia is moving its forces within its territory, and we can move our forces in any direction we want and closer to the areas that could pose a threat [and currently] we see US warplanes landing in Ukraine and US military equipment approaching our borders,"" Peskov said. Reality Less than a week later, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to discuss Russia's military build-up in and around Ukraine, Russia announced it wanted a legally binding guarantee that NATO would give up any military activity in eastern Europe and Ukraine and end a nuclear sharing agreement which allows the US to keep its nuclear weapons in Europe and use aircraft from European members of NATO to deliver nuclear weapons if needed. These proposals were in response to what Russia sees as threats to their own security from Ukraine's relations with NATO and NATO member nations. However, the US has been providing aid to Ukraine since 2014, and US warplanes landing in Ukraine with military equipment is not unusual. Some small arms and ammunition from the US were delivered to Ukraine days before Peskov's remarks as part of a previously scheduled security assistance package approved in September. The US military also helps train Ukrainian troops, though CNN reported that the Pentagon would not go into detail about timelines for operations or deployments, nor would it say if any schedules changed in light of the buildup of Russian forces near Ukraine. The Pentagon did note that US Marines operate throughout the continent for training and exercises. No plans to attack Russian statements On November 28, 2021, Peskov told state news agency TASS that ""Russia has never hatched, is not hatching and will never hatch any plans to attack anyone."" Reality Days later, a US intelligence report warned that Russia was planning to attack Ukraine in early 2022, The Washington Post first reported. US intelligence regarding Russian troop movements and Putin's decision to invade largely proved true. For months, Russia amassed forces along the border, underlying the premeditated aspect of the ultimate invasion in February. And in the weeks leading up to the invasion, the US widely shared that its intelligence suggested Putin would invade shortly.",29,2.1441079122844706,3.191051236515064,-1.0469433242305932,4
2022-03-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/europe/russia-ukraine-war-cyber-attacks/index.html,Russia's cyber offensive against Ukraine has been limited so far. Experts are divided on why,"US officials warned that a wave of debilitating cyberattacks could accompany Russia's war on Ukraine. So far they haven't materialized, and US and Ukrainian officials are contemplating why as they prepare for the next phase of the war. There have been several hacks of Ukrainian organizations, but no reports yet of the sort of high-impact cyberattacks on transportation or electric infrastructure that some feared. The possible explanations for this, analysts say, range from disorganization in Russian military planning to hardened Ukrainian defenses, to the fact that bombs and bullets take precedence over hacking in wartime. The reason Russia has so far not flexed in cyberspace during the war may be unattainable — or require being inside the minds of Russian spy chiefs. But how US, European and Ukrainian officials perceive the situation shapes how they allocate resources to defend Ukrainian computer networks as the war continues. ""What we have seen to date from Russia's state cyber actors appears to reflect the same challenges seen in their conventional forces,"" said a US cyber defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. ""It is likely that inadequate preparation and bad assumptions have resulted in a haphazard performance that underplays their known capabilities."" Limited Russian cyberattacks Cyberattacks have played a supporting, not a central, role in the war and hacking incidents preceded and accompanied Russia's bombardment of Ukraine: • February 15: Cyberattacks temporarily knocked the websites of Ukrainian agencies and big banks offline. The White House blamed Russia for the incident (the Kremlin denied involvement). • February 23: Hours before Russian airstrikes began hitting Ukraine, a cyberattack deleted data at multiple Ukrainian government agencies and private companies. • February 25: Ukrainian government officials accused hackers working for the Belarusian Ministry of Defense of trying to break into the private email accounts of Ukrainian military personnel. • March 10: Unidentified hackers caused disruptions at Ukrainian internet service provider Triolan, which has customers in big Ukrainian cities. Triolan blamed ""the enemy"" (a reference to Russia) for the incident but did not provide evidence to support the allegation. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the most senior military cyber official in the US government, offered a vague, multi-faceted explanation for the relatively muted Russian cyber activity to lawmakers this week. Defensive work by Ukrainians, ""some of the challenges that the Russians have encountered, and some of the work that others have been able to prevent their actions"" explained the situation, said Nakasone, who heads the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command. ""They bomb critical infrastructure, So they don't need to hack it' Ukrainian computer defenses have indeed improved since 2015 and 2016, when cyberattacks cut power in parts of Ukraine, and 2017, when devastating malicious software known as NotPetya emerged in the country and spread to organizations around the world, costing billions of dollars in damage. (The Justice Department blamed Russia's GRU military intelligence directorate for all three attacks; the Kremlin denied involvement.) But many analysts say that heightened Ukrainian cyber defenses cannot be the sole reason for the lack of visible Russian cyber operations. And US officials are predisposed to crediting Ukrainian network defenses in which Washington has invested millions of dollars, and countless hours on the ground in recent years, in building them up. Yegor Aushev, a Ukrainian cybersecurity executive who helped organize an ad hoc group of hackers to target Russian organizations during the war, offered a simpler explanation. ""The first phase of the war was a hybrid war,"" Aushev said by phone from Ukraine this week. The Russians, he said, used cyberattacks because there is plausible deniability in doing so. But the second phase of the war has been out in the open. ""They bomb critical infrastructure,"" Aushev said. ""So they don't need to hack it, in hidden mode."" John Hultquist, vice president of intelligence analysis at cybersecurity firm Mandiant, echoed that point. ""Cyberattacks are often reversible and they are often carried out for their psychological effects,"" Hultquist, a US Army veteran, told CNN. ""And in a situation when the Russians are already shelling cities, those effects are going to be fairly limited."" The so-called Ukraine ""IT army"" that Aushev is working with claims thousands of volunteer hackers from Ukraine and abroad. The Ukrainian government is actively encouraging these cyberattacks on Russian organizations — and claiming that these hacks are disrupting Russian cyber activities aimed at Ukraine. ""As it turns out, [Russian computer] systems are not that secure,"" boasted Serhiy Demedyuk, deputy secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. ""They employed their potential to carry out destructive attacks on other states, but failed to secure their own resources."" The extent to which pro-Ukraine hacking against Russian organizations has been successful is difficult to assess. There have been disruptions to Russian state media websites that parrot the Kremlin's propaganda about the war. The longer game Another possibility is that the fog of war has obscured some Russian cyber activity. We might not hear about it for months if some of the elite hacking teams associated with Russian intelligence services have engaged in significant activity in Ukraine, Hultquist said. ""It's a perfect environment for chaos to hide in,"" Hultquist told CNN. All the more so if bombs destroy digital evidence of a hack. The Ukrainian government has made plans to move some of its computer infrastructure out of Kyiv as Russian troops continue to pound the city. Preserving those digital records could be key to learning more about any additional Russian cyber activity during the war. With the war grinding on, US and European officials are also wary of any spillover from a Russian hack in Ukraine that could hobble agencies or corporations in NATO countries. The data-wiping hack on the eve of Russia's invasion was precisely targeted, but did infect two Ukrainian government contractors with a presence in Latvia and Lithuania, which are NATO members. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said a cyberattack could trigger NATO's collective defense clause, requiring all members to defend an attack on another member. But that has never happened and it is unclear what NATO's threshold in cyberspace is. Erica Lonergan, associate research scholar at Columbia University's Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, said it would make sense for Russia to retaliate against Western government sanctions in cyberspace in a way that doesn't escalate conventional conflict with NATO. ""Precisely for the reasons that cyber isn't necessarily useful in the battlefield, it is a way that states engage in subversion, create information advantage and cause disruption,"" Lonergan told CNN.",3,5.103301415050341,6.211012253192201,-1.1077108381418599,23
2022-03-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-12-intl/index.html,Russia intensifies strikes around Kyiv as it warns US against arming Ukraine,"The Russian assault across Ukraine raged Saturday as explosions were heard in Kyiv and fighting intensified around the capital. Hours later, Russia warned the United States that it would fire on weapon shipments to Ukraine, raising the risk of direct confrontation between Moscow and a NATO country. A number of major cities are under pressure as Russian strikes hit civilian structures. Smoke rose east of the river in Dnipro early on Saturday where CNN journalists felt at least two explosions and saw the cloudy remnants of what looked like anti-aircraft fire. A large swath of Makariv, a village 30 miles west of Kyiv, has sustained significant damage from apparent Russian airstrikes. CNN geolocated and verified the authenticity of photos, posted to social media Saturday, which show major damage to apartment complexes, schools and a medical facility. One of the more stark images from Makariv shows a large hole in the northern wall of an apartment building from a military strike. Many of the buildings in the photos have sustained damage on their northern facades, evidence that points to military strikes that hit them as being Russian. In Chernihiv, some 100 kilometers north of Kyiv, local landmark Hotel Ukraine was hit overnight. ""I am here now. There is no hotel anymore,"" Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv region administration, said Saturday. The northern city, which is close to the Belarus border, has been surrounded by Russian forces for more than a week and video from the city showed the collapsed floors of the hotel as well as widespread damage from missiles and airstrikes. Chaus said civilians were dying from the strikes, which brought down the city's electricity network. ""Many people are being injured. The enemy shells civilian infrastructure, where there is no military,"" he said, saying the city has ""no electricity, almost no water, gas, and heat."" The Russian Ministry of Defense has repeatedly claimed that Russian forces are not targeting civilians. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Saturday address the whole country was now a front line. ""A few small towns just don't exist anymore. And this is a tragedy. They are just gone. And people are also gone."" Zelensky said negotiations to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""must begin with a ceasefire,"" adding that Ukraine has lost about 1,300 troops as of Saturday. CNN has been unable to independently verify these numbers. Later Saturday, Zelensky said that he was grateful for international support but urged allies to provide more aid. ""I keep reiterating to our allies and friends abroad; they have to keep doing more for our country, for Ukrainians and Ukraine. Because it is not only for Ukraine, but it is for all of Europe,"" he said. ""The evil which purposefully targets peaceful cities and ambulance vans and explodes hospitals will not stop with just one country if they have the strength to keep going."" The US and NATO say they're taking steps to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian troops, and they have continued to provide Ukraine with security assistance, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. But the US and NATO have also tried to avoid being drawn into an outright conflict with Russia. US President Joe Biden emphasized that point on Friday, that the US will not send ground troops into Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO. ""We will not fight the third world war in Ukraine,"" Biden said after reiterating the US' full support to its NATO allies and promising that the US will defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory. ""I want to be clear though, we are going to make sure that Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves from an invading Russian force. And we will send money and food aid to save Ukrainians' lives,"" he added. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Saturday warned the US against transferring weapons to Ukraine, saying convoys with foreign weapons would be considered ""legitimate targets."" ""We warned the United States that pumping Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries orchestrated by them is not just a dangerous move, but these are actions that turn the corresponding convoys into legitimate targets,"" Ryabkov said Saturday on the Russian state-run Channel One, according to state-owned RIA Novosti news agency. Determined resistance In Ukraine, Russia has faced defiance from the public in the past two weeks. On Saturday, several hundred people swarmed the city hall in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol following the detention of its mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by armed men the day before. Shortly after Fedorov's detention, the Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses, allegations that Zelensky called a ""crime against democracy"" on Saturday. The Zaporozhye regional administration said Saturday a new mayor had been installed. Galina Danilchenko, a former member of the Melitopol city council, was introduced as the acting mayor on local TV, according to a statement from the regional administration posted on Telegram. In her televised statement, Danilchenko said that her ""main task is to take all necessary steps to get the city back to normal."" She claimed there were people still in Melitopol who would try to destabilize ""the situation and provoke a reaction of bad behavior."" ""I ask you to keep your wits about you and not to give in to these provocations,"" she said. ""I appeal to the deputies, elected by the people, on all levels. Since you were elected by the people, it is your duty to care about the well-being of your citizens."" In Kyiv, Russia's advance has faced stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces. On Saturday, the UK's Ministry of Defence's latest intelligence assessment said the bulk of Russian ground forces were about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the center of the Ukrainian capital. Maxar satellite imagery taken on Thursday showed that the 40-mile Russian column northwest of Kyiv had largely dispersed and regrouped. But the intelligence assessment warned, ""this is likely to support a Russian attempt to encircle the city. It could also be an attempt by Russia to reduce its vulnerability to Ukrainian counter attacks, which have taken a significant toll on Russian forces."" The north and northeastern cities of Chernihiv and Sumy, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and Mariupol in the south, remain encircled by Russian forces, the ministry added. A senior Ukrainian official in the southern region of Kherson, now in Russian control, has said that the ""occupiers"" are pressing the regional council to agree to a referendum on the area's ""independence"" from Ukraine. There's been no word from the Russian side about any referendum plans. Similar referendums were held after Russian-backed separatists took control in 2014 of parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. People's Republics were later declared in both regions. Ukraine's state-operated nuclear energy company said Saturday that Russian officials had arrived at Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhya, demanding to take control of the facility. Zaporizhzhya has been occupied by Russian forces for more than a week now, with Energoatom previously claiming its employees had been forced to work at ""gunpoint."" Chernobyl nuclear power plant is also under the control of Russian forces. Despite the onslaught, Zelensky claimed on Saturday that Ukrainian forces are inflicting the ""biggest blow to Russia's army in decades,"" saying that 31 Russian tactical battalion groups had lost capability, and more than 360 Russian tanks have been lost. Zelensky added that groups of Russian troops were surrendering to Ukrainian forces, but that Russia is now recruiting fighters, reservists, conscripts, and mercenaries to ""outnumber"" Ukrainian forces. Russia's losses include Major General Andriy Kolesnikov, the third Russian general to have been killed by Ukrainian forces, a Western defense official confirmed on Friday. He was commander of the Eastern Military District, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense's website, and the Western official noted for context that three Russian general staff officers were killed during the whole Syrian conflict. Deteriorating conditions As Russia sustains losses, its bombardment of the country continues to degrade living conditions in several areas. Officials are now racing to send aid and evacuate citizens from encircled cities. Ukrainian officials announced a fresh attempt to secure at least 13 evacuation corridors from different cities, despite reporting that only a few civilians could leave the previous day. Addressing the besieged city of Mariupol, Zelensky said Saturday that Ukrainian forces would guarantee a ceasefire along an evacuation corridor so supplies could enter, and civilians can leave. With relatively clear skies over Mariupol, new satellite imagery taken Saturday morning from Maxar showed the extent of the damage there, including some caused by military strikes reported earlier in the week. In Mariupol's western neighborhood of Zhovteneyvi, a large -- still smoldering -- crater was seen near the Okko gas station. Smoke appeared to be rising from an apartment complex across the street. The roofs of warehouses down the street also appeared to have large holes from military strikes. Within the apartment complex, several buildings seemed to have sustained significant damage. A debris field was seen surrounding some of the buildings with a large smoke plume. Just northwest of the gas station, an additional satellite image showed impact craters dotting a snow-covered field. Vehicle tread marks were also seen. Just more than a mile south, in an industrial area in the Primorskyi neighborhood, a large fire was seen raging. There was some good news amid the destruction. A pregnant woman, whose rescue from the Mariupol maternity hospital this week was captured in a viral AP photo, gave birth to a baby girl, her family told CNN. Mariana Vishegirskaya was among a number of women at the Mariupol maternity hospital who survived the shelling. Her aunt Tatiana Liubchenko said the baby was named Veronica but she was worried about the situation in the city. ""We got the information that the water and food of the people there are running out and we are very worried, because the green corridor is not opened and the Russians do not allow, the food does not come. And it's so cold there right now so they can't get warm,"" Liubchenko said. The fighting has displaced around 2 million Ukrainians in the country, the UN said Friday, and 2.5 million people have fled its borders.",17,4.111209122395478,1.5371134197565262,2.574095702638952,29
2022-03-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/europe/kyiv-russian-convoy-intl/index.html,The 40-mile-long Russian convoy near Kyiv has moved. Here's what it means for the Ukrainian capital,"A 40-mile-long (64km) Russian military convoy, composed of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery, has sparked dread among defending Ukrainians as it lumbered towards their capital, Kyiv. The column has been stalled for a week, but now the forces appear to be regrouping, according to Maxar Technologies satellite imagery taken on Thursday, which showed parts of the convoy had ""largely dispersed and redeployed."" Russia is regrouping for a possible attack on Kyiv, say UK defense officials, after initially making limited progress in its advancement towards the capital. An intelligence update published by the UK's Ministry of Defence on Friday said Russia ""is likely seeking to reset and re-posture its forces for renewed offensive activity in the coming days"" and it would likely ""include operations against the capital Kyiv."" With the clouds temporarily clearing around the Ukrainian capital, Maxar said the satellite images show some elements of the convoy have ""repositioned"" into forests and treelined areas near Lubyanka, Ukraine. The images were taken at 11:37 a.m. local time (4.37 a.m. ET) on Thursday. According to the satellite imagery, Russian military vehicles are seen sitting on roadways in residential areas in the town of Ozera -- 17 miles northwest of Kyiv and just north of the Russian-controlled Antonov Airbase in Hostomel. Towed artillery and other vehicles are seen taking cover in sparse patches of trees near Lubyanka -- about 3 miles (northwest of the Antonov Airbase. In Berestyanka -- 10 miles west of the airbase -- a number of fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field near trees. The satellite images taken on Thursday appear to also show fuel storage tanks on fire at the airbase, with a thick black plume of smoke seen rising from the tanks, located at the southern end of the airbase. Hostomel's airbase has been the site of intense clashes with Ukrainian forces since the start of Russia's invasion. It was reportedly captured by the Russian military on February 24. At the end of what was the convoy, a number of trucks and equipment are still seen on the roadway southeast of Ivankiv. Satellite images from Maxar also show significant damage to parts of the northern city of Chernihiv and the northwest suburbs of Kyiv. In Borodyanka, a series of apartment buildings is seen demolished. CNN has previously reported that these apartment buildings were damaged by Russian military strikes. Just outside of Kyiv's city limits in Stoyanka, a warehouse is seen in a satellite image completely gutted by fire. In the city of Chernihiv, roughly 80 miles northeast of Kyiv, the Epicenter K supermarket is also destroyed by fire. The charred remains of the building is seen; there is no more roof. A fire is also seen burning in one of Chernihiv's industrial districts, located on its south side. Russia reorientates Ukrainians successfully intercepted and attacked an advancing Russian tank column on Thursday as fighting picked up around Kyiv's northeast and east An overnight airstrike in the Brovary district, just east of the capital, caused no casualties, according to Kyiv authorities. Ukrainian authorities report a missile strike in the town of Baryshivka overnight some 45 miles east of the capital. ""According to preliminary information, the Iskander missile caused significant damage to infrastructure and housing. 60 apartment houses were completely damaged, 4 apartment buildings and 10 private houses were partially damaged,"" they said. Thomas Bullock, an analyst at Janes, a UK-based intelligence service, told CNN that ""Ukraine's tactic of targeting supply lines has worked well especially during the first five-10 days of the war. This was partially down to Ukrainian tactics and partially down to how Russia was operating."" The Russian forces ""prioritized rushing forward to secure objectives quickly"" in the first couple days of the invasion. This meant ""they weren't advancing as a coherent frontline securing territory as they go. This effectively allowed Ukrainian forces to slip behind Russia's advanced mechanized units and attack logistics columns traveling on unsecured roads in the rear."" But as ""Russia begins to reorient its forces for a longer war following their failure to secure a quick victory"" it is ""unclear how effective this tactic will be,"" Bullock added. The British Ministry of Defense update added that logistical issues continue to hamper the Russian advance ""as does strong Ukrainian resistance."" French armed forces spokesperson Pascal Ianni reiterated the UK assessment on Friday, saying the Russian army was poorly prepared for its invasion of Ukraine and is now facing many difficulties on the ground, ""particularly in the logistical field and in the field of intelligence,"" he told French TV station France2. ""It is possible that an attack on Kyiv will be carried out in the next few days, but actually taking control of Kyiv is a whole other matter and will take a long, long time,"" he said. The convoy is believed to have entered Ukraine via Belarus, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and where Russia moved huge numbers of troops to in recent weeks to carry out what they called joint exercises. When the exercises ended, the troops didn't leave and satellite images actually showed that Russia increased their military presence in the country. The convoy's dispersal comes after major cities in Ukraine -- including Dnipro in the center and Lutsk in the far west of the country -- were attacked by Russian forces Friday. As Ukrainian officials attempt to open evacuation routes on Friday around Kyiv, the United Nations said 2.5 million people had fled the country and 2 million people are displaced within Ukraine.",17,0.8812005400196015,0.5889880565582468,0.29221248346135464,29
2022-03-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-11-intl/index.html,"Russia widens attack on Ukraine's cities, striking western airfields and Dnipro","Russian forces launched multiple missile attacks on a wide range of targets across Ukraine in the early hours of Friday, striking airfields in the far west of the country and, for the first time, hitting the central city of Dnipro, to which Ukrainians from other embattled cities have fled. The airport at Lutsk, some 70 miles from the Polish border, was reported to have suffered substantial damage in the attacks. The governor of Volyn region said four missiles had been fired from a Russian bomber and that two people were killed. Plumes of smoke also rose from the military airfield at Ivano-Frankivsk, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Lutsk. It was previously struck by missiles on the first day of the conflict. ""On the morning of March 11, high-precision long-range weapons attacked Ukraine's military infrastructure. The military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk were put out of action,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said Friday. Three Russian airstrikes also caused serious damage in and around the central city of Dnipro on Friday morning, killing one person, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in an official Telegram channel. One strike was near a preschool and an apartment building and another hit a shoe factory, causing a fire, the service said. Many Ukrainians evacuated in recent days from other cities under Russian fire had been taken to the relative safety of Dnipro. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said Friday it remains ""gravely concerned by the rising death toll and human suffering in Ukraine"" and called ""for an immediate end to the attacks."" ""Civilians are being killed and maimed in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks, with Russian forces using explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas,"" OHCHR spokeswoman Liz Throssell said in a statement. OHCHR said it has so far recorded 549 civilian deaths and 957 injuries since the invasion began on 24 February, ""although the actual figure could be much higher."" ""Schools, hospitals, and kindergartens have been hit -- with hugely devastating consequences,"" Throssell said. On March 3, 47 civilians were killed when Russian airstrikes hit two schools and several apartment blocks in Chernihiv and on March 9, a Russian airstrike hit a Mariupol hospital, injuring at least 17 civilians, she said. ""We are still investigating reports that at least three civilians may have been killed in the airstrike,"" she said. ""We spoke to different sources in Mariupol, including local authorities, indicating consistently that the hospital was both clearly identifiable and operational when it was hit."" Throssell also said OHCHR has received ""credible reports of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas."" The use of cluster munitions in populated areas is ""incompatible with the international humanitarian law,"" she said. Elsewhere, in the southern city of Mykolaiv, heavy shelling erupted on Friday evening. Social media videos showed fires in the area and Vitaliy Kim, Head of Mykolaiv Region Administration, said that there were ""active hostilities near Guryivka,"" to the north of the city. In a series of messages on his Telegram channel, Kim said the bombardment amounted to ""indiscriminate shooting at civilian targets,"" including a cafe and apartment block. And in the southeastern city of Melitopol, Mayor Ivan Fedorov was seen on video being led away by armed men from a government building on Friday. The prosecutor's office for the separatist, Russian-backed Luhansk region now says they are weighing terrorism charges against him. Fedorov's detention by the armed men is the first known instance of a Ukrainian political official being detained and investigated by Russian, or Russian-backed forces, since the invasion began. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry published a strongly worded statement on Facebook, calling Fedorov's detention an ""abduction"" and a ""war crime."" Meanwhile the number of people who have fled Ukraine continues to rise. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said Friday that the number of people who have left the country has now hit 2.5 million. Many others are still trapped in dire conditions as Russian forces bombard multiple cities. Ukrainian authorities said there was limited success Friday in securing the evacuation of civilians from areas worst affected by the fighting. Resistance persists In eastern Ukraine, there is growing evidence that the town of Volnovakha, has finally fallen to Russian forces and their allies in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic. The city had been surrounded almost since the beginning of Russia's invasion but had been fiercely defended by Ukrainian forces. Some social media videos from the city showed Russian soldiers and vehicles in several neighborhoods, as well as abandoned Ukrainian tanks. Other videos showed widespread destruction in Volnovakha, and the Russian defense ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, claimed the town had been taken. Russia has made some additional advances around the rest of the country in the past 24 hours, a senior US defense official told reporters on Friday. But the French government painted a less than rosy picture of the Russian military's progress. The Russian army was poorly prepared for its invasion of Ukraine and is now facing many difficulties on the ground, ""particularly in the logistical field and in the field of intelligence,"" French armed forces spokesperson Pascal Ianni told TV station France2 on Friday. ""It is possible that an attack on Kyiv will be carried out in the next few days, but actually taking control of Kyiv is a whole other matter and will take a long, long time,"" he said. ""The Russian army is also caught up in a premature spring,"" he added, with the defrosting ground causing mobility difficulties for the military. Britain's Ministry of Defence said on Friday that Russian forces continued to make ""limited progress"" in advancing toward Kyiv -- but could be preparing for a fresh attack against the Ukrainian capital in the coming days. ""It remains highly unlikely that Russia has successfully achieved the objectives outlined in its pre-invasion plan,"" the ministry said in an intelligence update. ""Logistical issues that have hampered the Russian advance persist, as does strong Ukrainian resistance."" Fighting intensified to the northeast and east of the capital Friday, after the Ukrainians successfully intercepted and attacked an advancing Russian tank column on Thursday. An overnight airstrike on the Brovary district just east of the capital caused no casualties, according to Kyiv authorities. Ukrainian authorities also reported a missile strike on the town of Baryshivka overnight into Friday, some 45 miles east of the city. A Russian column that had been stalled for nearly two weeks outside Kyiv has now dispersed, according to Maxar satellite imagery from Thursday. The forces appear to be regrouping. And a western defense official confirmed on Friday that a third Russian general had been killed by Ukrainian forces. He was named as Major General Andriy Kolesnikov, and was commander of the Eastern Military District, according to the Russian defense ministry website. The official noted for context that three Russian general staff officers were killed during the whole Syrian conflict. In Moscow, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that the invasion was being carried out successfully, despite claims from Western leaders that its military has encountered unplanned obstacles and resistance. ""All is going according to the plan, we report to you here every day this week,"" Shoigu told Russian President Vladimir Putin at a televised meeting of the country's security council. Shoigu claimed that the Russian army has received more than 16,000 applications from volunteers in the Middle East wanting to join the war in Ukraine.

2022-03-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/politics/russia-ukraine-heavy-weaponry/index.html,US officials eye Russian reliance on unsophisticated but brutal heavy weaponry in Ukraine,"Russia has relied far more heavily on less sophisticated, so-called ""dumb"" bombs than it has on its arsenal of precision-guided munitions in its punishing war on Ukraine. It's a dynamic that US officials are watching closely for clues about the state of Russia's military — as these indiscriminate weapons kill scores of civilians. Russia has used a combination of missiles, artillery and rocket launchers to pummel major Ukrainian cities over the past two weeks, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. On Friday, Russia launched a barrage of missile attacks on a wide range of targets across central and western Ukraine, causing substantial damage and using what Russia's defense ministry said were ""high-precision long-range weapons."" But the number of ""precision-guided munitions that are being dropped from aircraft ... is small,"" Berrier said. US and Western officials say they don't know why Russia hasn't used more of these more sophisticated weapons, which its Su-34 fighter-bomber fleet regularly employed, along with other unguided bombs in Syria. It's an approach some US military and intelligence officials say could signal another surprising weakness in Russia's military campaign — or simply a terrifying willingness to employ brutal tactics that lead to countless civilian deaths in a war that many officials think could last weeks or even months. ""It's hard to say at this point whether that's driven by expense, if that's driven by a lack of inventory or if that's just driven by a desire to be more brutal in the use of force,"" a senior NATO official said on Thursday, calling it a ""big question."" Precision-guided munitions, or PGMs, are more expensive, time-consuming and complex to produce than unguided munitions and there has long been speculation that Russia's stockpile is relatively limited. It is possible, some outside analysts say, that Russia is simply holding its PGMs in reserve for later in the conflict — or as an emergency precaution in case Russia finds itself in conflict with NATO. One source familiar with the intelligence said that the Russia burned through the proportion of its PGM arsenal that it allocated for the operation in the early days of the conflict, when Moscow enforced stricter rules of engagement that eschewed widespread civilian casualties. But whatever the reason, officials say the impact is now being borne by Ukrainian hospitals, schools and apartment buildings destroyed by Russia's indiscriminate bombing campaign — even as a senior defense official cautioned on Wednesday that the US cannot prove whether guided or unguided munitions were used against a given target after the fact. The strategy may also create direct costs for Russia, according to one senior military official familiar with the latest intelligence. This person said that the use of some of Russia's ""dumb"" bombs requires its pilots to fly lower, making them more vulnerable to Ukraine's surprisingly effective anti-air defenses. Over the past several days, officials have noted a sharp decrease in overall Russian air activity over Ukraine. As the war enters its third week, Russian forces have been bogged down by not only a stiff Ukrainian resistance but myriad logistical and resupply missteps that Western officials have increasingly said show fundamental weaknesses in Russian planning and readiness. CIA Director Bill Burns on Tuesday said that Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion in part based on the assumption that his military was capable of a quick and decisive victory at minimal cost — one of several assumptions that Burns said had ""been proven wrong."" ""It is possible that we know more about the true state of fighting and the Russian readiness and capability at this point than Putin does himself,"" the senior NATO official said. Officials say there is still no question that Russia's military is vastly superior to Ukraine's fighting force and that Ukraine's prospects remain grim. Even in the face of Ukrainian resistance, Russia has made steady progress across the country. But intelligence officials have stopped predicting the imminent fall of Kyiv as the conflict has settled into a grinding war of attrition. The senior NATO official said he now believes the war may be measured in ""months to years,"" rather than days or weeks as Western officials has initially assessed. Russian problems Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said on Thursday that the US intelligence community had been caught by surprise by the clumsy execution of Putin's military strategy. ""We did well"" predicting that Putin had underestimated the resistance he would face in Ukraine, she said. ""We did not do as well in terms of predicting the military challenges that he has encountered with his own military."" US and Western officials say that it's difficult for them to nail down Russian losses, both in terms of battlefield casualties and destroyed equipment. Ukraine has reported that around 12,000 Russian soldiers have been captured or killed and more than 100 aircraft and helicopters, 317 tanks and over 1,000 armored personnel carriers have been eliminated. But even if those numbers can't be confirmed, officials say, it's clear that Russia has suffered significant troop and equipment losses. ""When you look at just the trash that is coming in from Russia on these train cars now, in terms of trucks and these little cars — they've got like civilian trucks and cars now on trains coming in to try to replace some of these heavier trucks that have been lost to Ukrainian counterattacks — that's amazing,"" said the senior NATO official. Russia's defense ministry on Wednesday also acknowledged that some conscripts were taking part in the war, while US officials say that Moscow is also seeking to recruit foreign fighters from Syria. Other foreign fighters, from Chechnya, are already in Ukraine, as is the mercenary group Liga, formerly known as the Wagner Group. Western officials see those supplementary forces as a potential sign that Russia is struggling to assemble sufficient combat power to continue its assault. ""We find that noteworthy that [Putin] believes that he needs to rely on foreign fighters to supplement what is a very significant commitment of combat power inside Ukraine as it is,"" a senior defense official told reporters on Thursday. Russia has also struggled to effectively supply its forward-deployed combat formations in the field with fuel, food and weapons. Russian forward-deployed units have often sprinted out ahead of their logistics train, leaving the support units vulnerable to Ukrainian counterattack. Meanwhile, a 40-mile convoy of Russian combat and logistics vehicles was stalled for days north of Kyiv, in part thanks to mechanical breakdowns and congestion and in part thanks to Ukrainian efforts to stymie its progress. However, by Thursday the convoy had ""largely dispersed and redeployed,"" according to Maxar Technologies satellite imagery. Still, despite Russian missteps, despite what officials have described as a heroic Ukrainian resistance, Western intelligence services are not assessing that Ukraine has turned the tide of the invasion. Russia's military remains qualitatively and quantitatively superior. Putin continues to carry out a sustained bombardment of Ukrainian cities with indiscriminate ""dumb"" bombs — including against civilian infrastructure — even in the face of international condemnation. Officials now believe that he is preparing to attempt to cut off food, water and potentially power supplies to Kyiv, as he has in other major cities within Ukraine. ""We see no signs that Putin has deviated from what his strategic political objectives are, nor do we see any signs that the military end states have changed,"" said the senior NATO official. ""The only major difference, aside from the miserable challenges that they're facing, is that they've just become more violent — not just against the military but against civilians.""",14,2.025302323797346,7.050478062066246,-5.0251757382689,12
2022-03-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/politics/thomas-greenfield-russia-war-crimes/index.html,US ambassador to UN says Russia's actions in Ukraine 'constitute war crimes',"US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Thursday that actions committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people constitute war crimes, marking the first time a senior US official has directly accused Moscow of war crimes since last month's attack on Ukraine began. ""They constitute war crimes; there are attacks on civilians that cannot be justified by any -- in any way whatsoever,"" she said in an interview with BBC ""Newshour"" on Thursday morning. Other Biden administration officials have not gone as far as to declare outright that Russia has committed war crimes -- violations of international laws of armed conflict -- and instead have pointed to ""credible reports"" that such crimes have been carried out and their support for investigations into Moscow's actions. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday referenced ""atrocities"" committed by the Russians and said that the UN should investigate the allegations of Russian war crimes. Later on Thursday State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the US has ""seen very credible reports"" of Russian actions that would constitute war crimes, echoing comments made by Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday. Thomas-Greenfield said in the interview with the BBC that the question of whether Russia is guilty of war crimes is the one ""we're being asked every day, and we're working with others in the international community to document the crimes that Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people."" ""I still see images of a women being rolled out of a hospital, pregnant, bleeding, people screaming, children crying. It is just unconscionable. And we call on Russia to change course. They have to end this conflict, and they have to stop the fighting, and they have to return to diplomacy. And we have made clear our strong support for Ukrainians' call for this to stop,"" she added. Thomas-Greenfield said she couldn't predict how the war crimes would be prosecuted, but ""what is important is that we collect the evidence and have the evidence ready and available to be used."" The ambassador also indicated that the US is supportive of the International Criminal Court (ICC) probe of Russia's actions in Ukraine, despite the US not being a member of the ICC and criticizing other ICC investigations. ""We've always been supportive of the Criminal Court taking actions when actions are required,"" she said. Speaking at a State Department briefing later Thursday, Price also welcomed the ICC investigation, noting its focus on the preservation of evidence -- a key factor in making an official determination that war crimes have been committed. ""We want to see evidence preserved. We are and will be in the process of marrying reports with evidence from the ground, and if we determine, if the international community determines that war crimes have been committed, that atrocities have been committed, that human rights abuses have been committed, we absolutely will hold the perpetrators accountable, whether they sit in Moscow, or whether they're commanders on the ground in Ukraine,"" Price said. ""The fact is that we've seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would, under the Geneva Conventions, constitute a war crime,"" he said, citing attacks on the hospital in Mariupol and strikes on schools, hospitals, buses, cars and ambulances. Harris: Russia's attacks amounted to 'atrocities of unimaginable proportions' Harris, who spoke at a news conference alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Thursday morning, said that Russia's attacks in Ukraine amounted to ""atrocities of unimaginable proportions."" But, she stopped short of calling Russia's actions war crimes. ""We are also very clear that any intentional attack on innocent civilians is a violation,"" Harris said. ""The UN has set up a process by which there will be a review and investigations, and we will of course participate as appropriate and necessary,"" she added. ""I have no question the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities."" Duda was more direct, calling war crimes ""obvious"" in Ukraine and saying refugees coming to his country have evidence of it on their phones. A senior administration official said that Harris' comments were in line with the administration's position that the deliberate targeting of civilians would be defined as a war crime and should be investigated, saying she was referring to an investigation through the UN Commission of Inquiry. On Sunday, Blinken said that the US is looking into ""credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would constitute a war crime,"" but had not declared that the US had made the assessment that Moscow was guilty of war crimes. ""What we're doing right now is documenting all of this, putting it all together, looking at it, and making sure that as people and the appropriate organizations and institutions investigate whether war crimes have been or are being committed, that we can support whatever they're doing,"" Blinken said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""So right now we're looking at these reports. They're very credible. And we're documenting everything.""",13,4.430164807396932,3.7992634235855283,0.6309013838114037,2
2022-03-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-10-intl/index.html,"Mariupol children's hospital bombing one of many attacks on medical facilities since Russian invasion, WHO says","An injured woman, heavily pregnant, is carried on a stretcher past the smoldering wreckage of Mariupol's maternity and children's hospital. Her face is pale, one hand cradles her belly in a protective gesture. Every window on that side of the building appears to be blown out; wreckage litters the ground around it. The searing image was taken following a Russian airstrike on the hospital Wednesday that injured 17 people, including children, women and doctors, according to Mariupol city officials. Three people died, the city council said Thursday, among them, a child. The city in southeastern Ukraine has been besieged by Russian forces for days, its trapped residents forced to shelter underground, melt snow for water and scavenge for food. Now, even a hospital caring for pregnant women, newborns and children is not safe. Mariupol's Mayor Vadym Boychenko condemned Russia's ""cynical and destructive war against humanity,"" in a video message on Thursday. ""Every 30 minutes Mariupol was invaded by Russian aviation that was shooting at civilian buildings killing civilians: elderly, women and children,"" he said, adding, ""it's genocide that was created by the Russian army with Putin."" Mariupol's hospital wasn't the only children's medical facility that was damaged by Russian forces on Wednesday. Two hospitals in Zhytomyr, west of the capital, Kyiv, had their windows blown out in a Russian airstrike on a thermal power plant and civilian building in the city, the mayor said. One of them was a children's hospital. There were no casualties and everyone was in a bomb shelter, according to the city's mayor, Serhii Sukhomlyn. The rules of war specify that civilians should not be targeted and that medical workers, medical vehicles and hospitals dedicated to humanitarian work cannot be attacked. But in the past two weeks Russian forces have repeatedly struck medical facilities in Ukraine, prompting claims they are being systematically targeted, despite Russian denials. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been 24 verified attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine so far. ""These attacks have led to at least 12 deaths and 17 injuries. At least 8 of the injured and 2 of the killed were verified to be health workers. The attacks took place between 24 February and 8 March,"" WHO said Thursday. ""WHO strongly condemns these attacks. Attacks on health care violate international law and endanger lives. Even in times of conflict, we must protect the sanctity and safety of health care, a fundamental human right,"" it said in an email to CNN. A CNN crew in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, saw patients -- including sick children -- take cover in a hospital's underground bomb shelter as air raid sirens wailed. Stass, 12 years old and heavily bandaged, was unaware that his father was not with him in the hospital at that moment because he was burying the boy's mother and sister. ""I was in the neighbor's basement when the bomb hit the roof on my side,"" he said. ""We ran to my granny's house. Another hit there. My arm is broken. My dad and neighbor brought me here. I was in a coma for two days."" In a late-night video address Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the Mariupol hospital bombing as an ""atrocity"" and ""proof of a genocide of Ukrainians,"" as he renewed his calls on Western leaders to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He also called on Russia to explain why it was carrying out strikes on hospitals. ""Why were they a threat to the Russian Federation? What kind of country is the Russian Federation that is afraid of hospitals, afraid of maternity wards and destroys them?"" he said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday alleged without evidence the bombed hospital in Mariupol was the radical Azov battalion's base and that all patients and nurses had left. Later on Thursday, a Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson denied in a briefing that Russia had shelled the maternity hospital at all, calling it a ""provocation."" Lavrov said Russia informed the UN Security Council meeting about this a few days before the attack. The Azov battalion is integrated into the Ukrainian armed forces but was formerly an independent ultra-nationalist militia. ""On March 7 or 6, I don't remember exactly now, but at the meeting of the UN Security Council, our delegation presented facts that this maternity hospital had long been captured by the Azov battalion and other radicals,"" Lavrov said. ""All the women in labor, all the nurses, in general, all the staff was driven out of there,"" Lavrov added. Video from the hospital after the bombing clearly showed there were both patients and staff there, including pregnant women. A 'dire and desperate' situation The Mariupol hospital attack has sparked a flurry of international condemnation, with French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal calling it ""inhumane"" and ""unjustifiable"" in comments Thursday. ""I want to say in the name of the French government that the strike by Russia against Mariupol's pediatric hospital was inhumane and cowardly. It's women, children, healthcare workers who were targeted, it's unjustifiable,"" he said in an interview with French radio station RTL. Calling again for a ceasefire in Ukraine, Attal predicted the worst was yet to come in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also condemned the strike in Mariupol, saying: ""There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenseless."" The United Nations said it was following up ""urgently"" on ""shocking reports"" of the bombing of the hospital. ""It bears reminding that we have called, WHO has called for an immediate halt to attacks on health care, hospitals, health care workers, ambulances -- none of these should ever, ever be a target,"" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday. The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine ""continues to deteriorate rapidly,"" Dujarric added. More than 2.2 million people have crossed international borders escaping Ukraine since the invasion began, Dujarric said. In Mariupol itself, the situation is becoming ""increasingly dire and desperate,"" the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Thursday. It warned that ""hundreds of thousands of people have no food, water, heat, electricity, or medical care,"" and said that ""people urgently need respite from violence and humanitarian aid."" ""All the shops and pharmacies were looted four to five days ago. Some people still have food but I'm not sure for how long it will last,"" the deputy head of sub-delegation of ICRC Sasha Volkov said in a interview recorded Wednesday and published on the ICRC website. Many people in Mariupol have reported having no food for children, Volkov said. ""People started to attack each other for food. People started to ruin someone's car to take the gasoline out."" Disturbing pictures from an Associated Press photographer showed bodies being lowered into a mass grave in the city on Wednesday, some encased in body bags but others apparently wrapped only in blankets. At least 1,300 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since the Russian invasion began, an adviser to the city's mayor said Wednesday. CNN cannot independently verify these casualty figures. Zelensky warned Russian propagandists they ""will be held responsible for complicity with war crimes"" in a video message Thursday. ""Russian citizens will hate you for consistently lying to them for many years. When they will feel the consequences of your lies, feel with their wallets, their dwindling opportunities, with the stolen futures of the Russian children,"" he said, adding that the aggressor also pays a price in war. His warning came after Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova on Wednesday called for a ""new model"" of investigative efforts to tackle alleged war crimes in Ukraine. And for those trying desperately to flee Russian attacks, evacuation efforts continue to be fragile and fleeting. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of violating agreed pauses in hostilities. On Thursday morning, the Ukrainian government said that it was opening evacuation corridors -- designed to allow civilians to escape to safer regions -- in several parts of the country. Later that day, Zelensky said about 100,000 people have been evacuated through the corridors over the past two days. Mariupol and the city of Volnovakha however, remain completely blocked, he said, adding that despite Ukrainian officials' best efforts to make the corridor work, ""Russian troops did not cease fire."" Meanwhile, a meeting between Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Lavrov in Turkey ended Thursday without an agreement reached on evacuation corridors or a ceasefire, Kuleba said. At a news conference following the meeting, Kuleba said he had raised the prospect of establishing a corridor to allow civilians to flee from the besieged city of Mariupol but ""unfortunately Minister Lavrov was not in a position to commit himself to it.""",17,3.1366466344268646,0.962095694051073,2.1745509403757914,1

The attack came despite Russia agreeing to a 12-hour pause in hostilities to allow refugees to evacuate a number of towns and cities. Mariupol city council posted a video of the devastated hospital in the city and accused Russian forces of dropping several bombs on it from the air. ""The destruction is enormous,"" said the council. ""The building of the medical facility where the children were treated recently is completely destroyed."" Police in the Donetsk region said that according to preliminary information at least 17 people were injured, including mothers and staff, as a result of the attack. Zelensky repeated his call for the NATO military alliance to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine, as he expressed his outrage at the attack. ""Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,"" he said on Telegram. ""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,"" Zelensky said, adding, ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?"" Later Wednesday, Zelensky called the strike ""final proof, proof of a genocide of Ukrainians taking place."" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed, without providing evidence, that Ukrainian forces had ""equipped combat positions"" within the hospital. Video from the hospital after the bombing clearly showed there were both patients and staff there, including heavily pregnant women who were carried from the hospital. The hospital attack received international condemnation, with the United Nations saying it would follow up ""urgently"" on the ""shocking reports,"" and that healthcare facilities hospitals and health care workers should not ""ever, ever be a target."" A city administration building and a university in Mariupol, less than a kilometer from the bombed-out hospital, has been identified by CNN as a second location in the city hit by an apparent Russian military strike. Images on social media show significant destruction at the University and City Council Building. The strategic port city of Mariupol on Ukraine's southeast coast has been under siege for days and has been ""isolated"" by Russian forces, a senior US defense official said Tuesday. Russia continues to bombard Mariupol and its troops are not inside the city ""in any significant way,"" added the official. Two officials said Wednesday that about 1,300 civilians there have been killed since the Russian invasion began. Residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days, and on Tuesday Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia of committing war crimes by holding 300,000 civilians ""hostage."" ""The situation in Mariupol is desperate,"" Mirella Hodeib, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told CNN on Monday. Evacuation corridors On Wednesday, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said both sides had agreed to a ceasefire and planned evacuation corridors from a number of cities in order to allow people to leave. The attempted evacuation corridors were scheduled to operate from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m local time, with routes including Energodar to Zaporizhia; Mariupol to Zaporizhia; Volnovakha to Pokrovsk; Izium to Lozova; and four separate routes from Vorzel, Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, and Gostomel to the capital city of Kyiv. A corridor also operated between Sumy and Poltava, a route that enabled about 5,000 Ukrainians to evacuate on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian Presidential Office Deputy Kirill Timoshenko. But several hours after the evacuation was due to begin, there was no sign of people being brought out of Vorzel, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Irpin and Bucha in the bus convoys that had been organized. The city council of Bucha accused Russian forces of blocking the evacuation in a statement on Facebook. ""The occupants are disrupting the evacuation. Currently, 50 buses are blocked by Russian military in the parking lot,"" the post read. An attempted evacuation from Demidova, a town north of Kyiv that was not among the agreed corridors, ran into trouble. One police officer was killed and two more people seriously injured during an attempted evacuation of civilians, according to regional authorities. In the east, it was impossible to evacuate civilians from the town of Izium ""as we constantly hear explosions,"" said Oleh Syniehubov, administrative head of Kharkiv region. However, greater progress appeared to be made in organizing buses to get people out of the central city of Enerhodar, as well as Irpin and Vorzel. ""The evacuation from the city continues,"" wrote Оleksandr Markushyn, mayor of Irpin, on Facebook. ""There are buses in the center of Irpin. We are evacuating as many people as possible."" In Vorzel, all of the children that had been stranded in an orphanage have been evacuated, as has the local maternity hospital, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser in the president's office. At least 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, the UN estimates. But millions more remain trapped in towns and cities that have come under sustained attacks by Russian forces in recent days. And on Tuesday Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov claimed more than 400 civilians have been killed, including 38 children, with the real death toll expected to be higher. Reznikov accused Russia of ""a real act of genocide"" and ""war crimes,"" claiming that Russian forces had fired on the evacuation corridors. Kharkiv encircled The city of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine is encircled by Russian forces and continues to suffer heavy shelling, the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted Wednesday. On Tuesday, Kharkiv Mayor Igot Terekhov told CNN the situation was ""difficult"" and there was ""constant shelling from heavy artillery"" on residential neighborhoods and civilian infrastructure. ""They're hitting our water and heating and gas supply,"" said Terekhov. ""They're trying to interrupt our power supplies."" Kharkiv is home to 1.5 million people, said Terekhov, adding that utility services were working to keep people warm as cold weather approaches. Terekhov said he regards indiscriminate shelling as ""an act of genocide."" He added that any aid or assistance would be gratefully received, and expressed hope about the ultimate outcome. ""I am absolutely confident that we will defeat the Russians,"" he added. Zelensky calls for action to prevent 'catastrophe' Russian forces also continue to bear down on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and on Tuesday the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, Oleksiy Kuleba, said the humanitarian situation in areas around the city remains difficult. ""The main issue today remains humanitarian aid. Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka, Vorzel - residents of these settlements are forced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food. The occupiers do not give humanitarian corridors, do not give guarantees,"" Kuleba said, naming five districts to the north and west of Kyiv. On Wednesday, these five districts were named among evacuation corridors agreed by Ukraine and Russia. Also on Wednesday, Zelensky repeated his call for military intervention from Western allies. ""Ukraine has been saying this to its partners from the first day of the war: If you don't close the skies, you will also be responsible for this catastrophe, a massive humanitarian catastrophe,"" he said. The Ukrainian government has meanwhile announced that it will ban exports on key agricultural goods, including wheat, corn, grains, salt, and meat, after passing a cabinet resolution Tuesday. Ukraine's minister of agrarian policy and food, Roman Leshchenko, said the steps had been taken ""to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine"" and ""meet the needs of the population in critical food products.""",17,0.9925846689916666,4.494046062524052,-3.5014613935323853,1

The ministry admitted that conscripts were ""discovered"" in Ukraine but claimed they have already been withdrawn and returned to Russia. ""Unfortunately, several facts of the presence of conscripts in the units of the Russian armed forces involved in the conduct of a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine were discovered,"" Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said in a video message. A day earlier, in an International Women's Day address, Putin had reassured soldiers' mothers and wives that Russian conscripts are not taking part in his invasion of Ukraine, which he has referred to as a ""special military operation.""

""And there will be no additional call-up of reservists."" The Russian President stated that only ""professional military personnel"" were involved in the invasion.

2022-03-09,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/russia-ukraine-pentagon-nato/index.html,Pentagon shores up its NATO defenses in Europe,"With continued worry that Russia's bloody invasion of Ukraine could spill over into neighboring countries, the Pentagon is putting in place the military infrastructure needed to help run a war in Europe and meet President Joe Biden's pledge to defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory, according to several defense officials. The Pentagon has deployed thousands of additional troops to Europe, including 500 more US troops announced Monday. The US is sending defensive weapons like Patriot missiles to Poland and considering moving additional assets to protect other allies like Romania and the Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia from any Russian moves on their borders, officials say. A spokesman for US European Command told CNN on Tuesday evening that the United States is sending two Patriot missile batteries to Poland as a ""defensive deployment"" to counter any potential threat to US and NATO allies. The Pentagon estimates that as many as half of the 670 missiles Russia has fired against Ukraine have been launched from inside that country, raising concerns that it can more easily reach NATO countries if it chooses to lash out or expand the scope of the war. In all, the US has repositioned nearly 15,000 military personnel in reaction to Russian aggression. The total number of US troops in Europe is now expected to reach 100,000. The US effort comes along with a dramatically stepped-up NATO deterrence, as any US military operation would almost certainly be under a NATO umbrella. ""We have 130 jets at high alert. Over 200 ships from the high north to the Mediterranean, and thousands of additional troops in the region,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday while traveling in Latvia. The latest deployment includes an ""air support"" operations center heading to Poland and Romania, as well as refueling and maintenance specialists to Germany to bolster US and NATO air operations over the region. The Army's Fifth Corps also is deploying 300 headquarters troops to Poland and Germany to provide command and control for US ground forces. The US Navy briefly positioned a carrier in the northern Aegean Sea this week that could be used in a contingency for flight operations should tensions escalate. Allthe troop movements had long been expected, a senior defense official insisted. But there is no question it's all about protecting against any possible Russian incursion into NATO member nations. While the US is adamant about its intent to avoid a direct conflict, the Pentagon's deployments are aimed at putting a military structure in place both to deter Russia from widening the scope of its war and to prepare against a deliberate or accidental spillover of the fighting into NATO territory. ""One of the things that we've talked about is how important protecting NATO territory is, and that includes NATO airspace,"" a defense official told CNN. In the air, dozens of US aircraft -- including advanced F-35s fighter jets and intelligence and reconnaissance planes -- are conducting daily patrols on both deterrence and intelligence collection missions, while staying outside Ukrainian airspace and out of the reach of Russian anti-aircraft weapons. Protecting against a wider war Biden and top US officials have repeatedly stressed that US troops will not fight in Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO. At the same time, however, senior US officials have continued to reiterate that the US commitment to defend fellow NATO countries in the event of an attack is ""sacrosanct."" NATO's Article 5 doctrine says that any attack on one NATO country is an attack on all -- meaning the US and other European allies would be obligated to come to the defense of any NATO member attacked by Russia. The moves are a recognition that the US military has to be prepared for the contingencies that the biggest land war in Europe since World War II may not remain confined to Ukraine's borders. Part of the concern among US officials is that Russian President Vladimir Putin could decide to attack NATO nations, especially if he feels backed into a corner. Last week, the Kremlin put forward a list of ""de facto unfriendly countries,"" including the US. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, the US and its allies have imposed a series of punishing financial sanctions on Russia, which Putin has since likened to a ""declaration of war."" Russia has also issued increasingly threatening rhetoric about countries that send weapons to Ukraine. On Tuesday, the Pentagon dismissed a plan floated by the Polish government to deploy its MiG-29 fighter jets to a US base in Germany so they could be delivered to Ukraine. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the proposal was not ""tenable,"" in part because the prospect of fighter jets ""departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance."" Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a national security and military analyst for CNN, said the Biden administration's reinforcement of NATO is important both to assuage the fears of NATO countries that had worried in the past about the US military's commitment to Europe and to send a clear message of deterrence to Putin. ""Putin went into this whole thing with Ukraine thinking the US wouldn't do anything, and I think he's very surprised at what he's seeing right now,"" Hertling said. ""I don't think Putin is stupid enough to go one on one against NATO ... but if he does, he will be outgunned and outmanned, other than nuclear weapons."" An umbrella of air defense As anxiety mounts in Eastern Europe that the Russians could launch a potential attack against NATO's eastern flank, the US is increasing its defensive missile capabilities there, according to a US official familiar with current administration thinking. ""The US is considering a range of capabilities,"" the official said. Along with the move of Patriot missile batteries to Poland, potential shipments could also include the THAAD anti-missile systems, which have successfully been used in the Middle East to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles There is no specific plan yet, but the idea centers on the concern that Russian missiles or aircraft might attack targets inside NATO territory at some point if Putin decides the support of those nations for Ukraine threatens his plans there. And because of the close proximity of the airspace, there is also concern that air defense be available if Russian aircraft inadvertently stray into NATO airspace. The establishment of a so-called US-Russia deconfliction line was in part to address those worries. But there is a sense an umbrella of air defense is needed, not just a means of communication. Because of the defensive nature of these systems, the US will emphasize that Russia should have no concerns. US naval preparations US naval forces are also scoping out how they might respond to Russian aggression. The aircraft carrier Harry S Truman has been in the northern Aegean Sea this week in part to ensure it can conduct flight operations from there if tensions escalate in the region, according to a US official familiar with the carrier's current task. The official did not disclose the exact location of the ship but noted it's not routine to operate in the Aegean's northernmost waters. The area is relatively confined for carrier operations due to the number of small islands and heavy commercial maritime traffic. ""In the event of further escalation,"" the Navy could be told to project more fighter jet air patrols into the Black Sea, the official said. ""If Russia sought to run the Turkish strait and Turkey asked for NATO support,"" then carrier aircraft could be used for combat air patrols over the Black Sea and Strait of Dardanelles. Turkey administers passage permission to transit into the Black Sea for warships and there is concern about Russia's future plans there, so keeping that waterway open would be part of any potential US and NATO effort if Turkey requests help.

2022-03-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/world/scott-kelly-rogozin-roscomos-twitter-russia-ukraine-scn/index.html,Former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian space chief engage in Twitter fight,"An extraordinary war of words is transpiring between the head of Russia's space agency and one of NASA's most famous former astronauts as the US-Russian partnership at the International Space Station hits its lowest point since its inception. Scott Kelly, who famously spent a year in space aboard the station, has been blocked on Twitter by Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin after Kelly criticized Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Rogozin's repeated threats to pull out of the International Space Station, typically a venue of cooperation immune from geopolitical chaos. ""Get off, you moron!"" Rogozin said in a quickly deleted Tweet. ""Otherwise, the death of the International Space Station will be on your conscience."" ""Dimon, why did you delete this tweet?"" Kelly replied in Russian. ""Don't want everyone to see what kind of child you are?"" In an interview with CNN, Kelly described it as ""the first Twitter argument I've ever had."" On Wednesday, Kelly announced on Twitter — in Russian — that he was returning a medal awarded to him in 2011 by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. ""Mr. Medvedev, I am returning to you the Russian medal 'For Merit in Space Exploration,' which you presented to me,"" Kelly wrote, according to a translated version of the tweet. ""Please give it to a Russian mother whose son died in this unjust war. I will mail the medal to the Russian embassy in Washington. Good luck."" The tweet came in response to a post from Medvedev that wished women a ""Happy Holidays."" Social media propaganda Kelly said in an interview earlier this week that he felt compelled to speak out after Rogozin shared a Roscosmos-produced video showing two Russian cosmonauts floating inside the space station waving goodbye to NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who is supposed to return to Earth with them on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on March 30. ""If he's going to act like a child, then I'm going to treat him like one,"" Kelly said. ""It's just unimaginable that the Russian space program would leave a person behind in space that they were responsible for bringing home. I don't see that happening."" But Kelly quickly reconsidered after remarking how he also thought it was inconceivable that Russia would launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. ""Even though I just said it was unimaginable, maybe they might leave a person behind. I don't know,"" Kelly said. There are currently four NASA astronauts, two Russian cosmonauts, and one European Space Agency astronaut living and working aboard the International Space Station. But Vande Hei is the only NASA astronaut featured in the make-believe Roscosmos video. ""If I was him, I would feel like I'm just going to keep doing my job,"" Kelly said. ""And if they (Roscosmos) want to leave me up here, then I'll find another way home."" Kelly, who is fluent in Russian after spending several years training in Moscow's Star City, commends most Roscosmos employees for being ""professional, reasonable people"" who ""want this partnership to continue."" International cooperation NASA has remained silent on Rogozin's most recent threats to abandon Vande Hei and detach the Russian segment from the space station. But last week, NASA said there were no signs Russia was withdrawing its support from the International Space Station as a result of US sanctions. ""We are not getting any indications at a working level that our counterparts are not committed to ongoing operation on the International Space Station. We as a team are operating just like we're operating three weeks ago,"" said Kathy Lueders, NASA's associate administrator for space operations. The space station has been a beacon of international cooperation for more than two decades, and Kelly remains confident it can continue. ""NASA can do really amazing things when they put their minds to it, and I do think they can hold this partnership together,"" Kelly said. But he also noted that ""sometimes things become more important than spaceflight. In this case, it's Russia waging a war against an innocent country. And if I have the ability to speak up and get attention, and to help the Russian people see the truth, then I'm going to do it."" Ridesharing in space For nearly a decade, Russia's Soyuz vehicles had been the only means of getting astronauts to and from the space station. But that reliance ended after SpaceX debuted its Crew Dragon capsule in 2020, and the US regained human spaceflight capabilities. There are, however, tentative agreements for US astronauts to ride on Russian Soyuz vehicles and for Russian cosmonauts to fly with SpaceX in the future. NASA said in a statement Tuesday that it ""continues to work toward an agreement with Roscosmos."" In addition to Vande Hei's slated to return to Earth on a Soyuz vehicle later this month, NASA astronauts routinely travel to Russia for training and vice versa. Boeing is also working on its own crewed capsule that could be capable of ferrying astronauts to the space station for the United States and its partners. That project, however, is years behind scheduled and beleaguered with hangups. The latest update on that spacecraft came from NASA in January, when NASA and Boeing revealed they were looking toward a May launch of an uncrewed test flight of Boeing's spacecraft, Starliner. In a statement Wednesday, NASA said it ""remains focused on continuous safe operations of the International Space Station and there is no change to the agency's support for ongoing in-orbit and crew return operations."" ""Staffing levels for NASA personnel in Russia fluctuate based on operational demands,"" the statement reads. ""The agency is in constant contact with U.S. Embassy Moscow and the Department of State regarding the presence of NASA personnel in-country.""",3,7.667259538498816,7.2317192748295405,0.43554026366927534,11
2022-03-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/europe/russian-general-killed-ukraine-kharkiv-intl/index.html,Ukraine claims Russian general has been killed in Kharkiv,"The Ukrainian defense ministry has claimed that a Russian general was killed in battle near Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv. The short statement on Monday offered no proof of the death of Maj. Gen. Vitaly Gerasimov, and gave no details of when he was killed. Russian state media said nothing Tuesday about Gerasimov, although it did name other Russians killed in Ukraine. CNN has not been able to independently verify Ukraine's claim, and Russia's defense ministry did not immediately respond to CNN's questions about Gerasimov on Tuesday, which is a national holiday in Russia. The United States also cannot confirm the Ukrainian claims, a senior US defense official said Tuesday. Ukraine identified Gerasimov as ""a Russian military commander, major general, chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 41st Army of the Central Military District of Russia"" and said he was a veteran of Russian campaigns in Chechnya and Syria. ""A number of senior Russian army officers were also killed and wounded,"" the Ukrainian defense ministry statement said. The Ukrainian ministry also alluded in its statement to communication problems that it says Russia's army is facing. The executive director of the open source investigative outlet Bellingcat, Christo Grozev, detailed in a Twitter thread that the information of the general's death may have been gleaned from an intercept of a phone call on an unsecured network. CNN has been unable to confirm those details. Franz Stefan Gady, research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), told CNN the reported death of the general is ""testimony to the ferocity of the fighting near Kharkiv,"" though he added that Ukrainian reports of the deaths of senior Russian officers remained murky. Gady also said it was an indication that senior Russian officers ""need to be leading from the front to regroup and consolidate their forces,"" and to ""push their soldiers forward to attack,"" amid low troop morale. He suggested that such an approach could lead to other reports of high-ranking military deaths. Russian forces have been launching sustained strikes on Kharkiv for in recent days. Shelling from heavy artillery, air raids and fire on residential districts has left the key northeastern city devastated but it has not yet fallen to the Russians. Russian troops are still facing Ukrainian resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country, according to a senior US defense official. The city's mayor Igor Terekhov told CNN's New Day on Tuesday: ""Kharkiv currently has water supply and heating supplies to all the buildings that are still standing except for those that have been destroyed."" Describing the attacks as a ""genocide"", Terekhov asked: ""What else can it be? There is no military infrastructure, no military facilities in these areas. Strikes are happening in kindergartens, schools, maternity hospitals, clinics. ""This isn't an accident. I can understand when there's an accidental strike. But when it's hundreds of civilian buildings hit, that is no accident. That is a targeted attack,"" he alleged. In a post on Facebook Sunday, Kharkiv's regional administration said ""repeated shelling"" of the city's TV tower had knocked out TV and radio broadcasting. The Kremlin has denied targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, despite multiple documented casualties.",14,7.274752116407935,1.8408473876965483,5.433904728711386,29
2022-03-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-08-intl/index.html,"Civilians flee Sumy after evacuation corridor opens, as 2 million refugees leave Ukraine","A tense and fleeting evacuation from Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy took place on Tuesday after Russian airstrikes killed 21 people, including two children, the night before, Ukrainian authorities said. Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow's invasion on February 24. The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city's regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy. ""At the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,"" Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. ""After 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy."" The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians ""hostage"" in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration. Ukrainian authorities said that a long-awaited convoy of humanitarian aid to the city appeared to have come under fire on Tuesday. Russian troops are not allowing ""children, women and the elderly"" out of the city, and have launched an attack ""precisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,"" Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation said. CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response. A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been ""isolated"" by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it ""in any significant way."" CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days. Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught. ""The main issue today remains humanitarian aid,"" Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video. Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are ""forced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,"" he said, adding that Moscow is preventing ""humanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation."" On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces ""violated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,"" following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army's advance in northern Ukraine. That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing ""several civilians"" trying to evacuate the town of Irpin. Zelensky calls for help as Ukrainians flee west Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the ""sidelines"" of the Russian invasion. Addressing the UK's House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that ""we will fight to the end,"" echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famous wartime speech. ""We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,"" he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to ""strengthen the sanctions"" against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia ""as a terrorist state"" and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a ""responsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine"" during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits. ""That would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,"" said Stoltenberg. ""The situation could spiral out of control,"" he said. On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city. ""In order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,"" Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. ""If the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility."" The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling. The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country. In total Russia has launched ""nearly 670"" missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday. Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, ""the other half largely from inside Ukraine,"" the official said. ""A little bit more than 70"" missiles have been fired from Belarus, and ""only a half dozen or so"" are coming from the Black Sea, the official added. A humanitarian crisis keeps growing Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia's invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began. The milestone is a ""terrifying"" number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries ""where they have connections, family,"" he added. ""What worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,"" said Grandi. At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.",17,1.405459432222345,2.1405905857406333,-0.7351311535182883,1
2022-03-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/india/indian-students-stuck-sumy-ukraine-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,Bus to nowhere: Indian students sent back to bunker after failed Sumy evacuation,"Indian university student Niranjana Santhosh was so close to being evacuated from the bombarded Ukrainian city of Sumy on Monday that she was sitting on a bus with her bags packed, waiting for the driver to start the engine. But three hours later, she and dozens of other Indian students who had hoped to be ferried to a safer city, away from Russian attacks, received a WhatsApp message from the Indian embassy with devastating news. A temporary ceasefire negotiated between Russia and Ukraine to allow civilians to flee four cities, including Sumy, had failed. ""We are so sad and desperate,"" Santhosh, who left the bus to return to the hostel above the dank, dark bunker where hundreds of students have huddled for days with little food and no electricity. Some are so thirsty they're melting snow to drink. The failed evacuation raises pressure on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring the students home as anger grows and Russia's invasion intensifies with attacks on residential and civilian targets. Modi spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday about the students' plight, according to a statement from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. Russia claims it is willing to cease its offensive, and open corridors to allow citizens to leave a small number of cities, including Sumy. However, Ukraine has rejected that on the basis Ukrainians would be evacuated to Russia or its ally Belarus and would require people to travel through active areas of fighting. Ukrainian and Western leaders have also accused Russia of repeatedly sabotaging rescue efforts by continuing to target pre-approved safe routes. On Sunday, a Russian strike hit an evacuation crossing point outside Kyiv, killing eight people including two children trying to flee. In Sumy, the Indian students -- like millions of Ukrainians in cities across the country -- are growing increasingly desperate to escape Russia's attacks. ""I'm mentally exhausted,"" Santhosh said. ""We are just living with hope."" On Tuesday, Indian Cabinet Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the evacuation of all students in Sumy to Poltava, a city 100 miles away, was underway. ""As we are speaking the evacuation is going on,"" Puri told reporters Tuesday evening Indian local time. Uncertainty and fear Merlyn Shebu arrived in Ukraine just over two months ago, excited about studying her first year of medicine at Sumy State University. But for nearly two weeks, she's been sheltering with other students in a dusty bunker beneath their hostel. Sewage water flows through the cold and damp room and fungus grows up the walls. There are no toilets, and students have no place to even sleep on the uneven concrete floor in freezing temperatures. ""We are in a desperate situation. We don't know who will come and help us,"" 21-year-old Shebu told CNN last week. ""Please evacuate us soon before our life ends here."" More than 2,000 international students from 27 countries, including China and Turkey, remain stranded in Sumy, according to a tweet from Ukrainian lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko posted Tuesday. She said Russian had refused a ""green"" corridor and told the students to ""hold tight, #Ukraine army will be there soon."" The Indian students who spoke to CNN from Sumy say they are studying in Ukraine because many of them didn't qualify for the limited places at Indian medical schools, and university fees in Ukraine are significantly cheaper than private universities in India. According to data from UNESCO, more than 14,000 Indians are currently enrolled in Ukraine universities -- the single largest group of foreign students in the country. Now only about 700 remain, according to the Indian government. Most are in Sumy -- Indian students in other cities were advised to leave Ukraine as tension built before the invasion. ""I think we will go back to India only after we die,"" 23-year-old medical student Mahtab Raza told CNN from Sumy last week, his voice quivering in fear. ""We have been imploring the government to rescue us for days. Everyone is crying, everyone is scared."" On Saturday, a group of students became so desperate to leave they threatened to walk 37 miles (60 kilometers) to the Russian border, braving Russian gunfire and damaged roads and bridges. ""If anything happens to us, all the responsibility will be on the Indian embassy,"" Mariya Munaf, a 22-year-old student, said on a video message as she stood with at least 100 students, some holding Indian flags. CNN contacted the Ministry of External Affairs multiple times to ask what was being done to evacuate the students in Sumy but officials declined to comment. 'I survive on water' The Indian government issued urgent advisories for nationals to evacuate Kyiv and Kharkiv on February 15 and make their way to the western Ukrainian border. But the students in Sumy say they weren't given clarity about their situation -- until Saturday. Calls to the Indian embassy's helpline went unanswered for days, they said. They fear either dying in their bunker or being shot outside, like another Indian student, Naveen Gyanagoudar, who was killed by Russian shelling last week while buying groceries in the city of Kharkiv. ""After Naveen's death, I started eating once a day,"" said Shweta Raj, a 22-year-old medical student. ""What if something happens to me while I'm standing in line (to get food)? So I eat once a day. I eat very little. I survive on water."" Back home in India, Gyanagoudar's death sparked political debate. Opposition parties criticized the Indian government's evacuation efforts, saying they needed to be better planned. Some repeated demands from the West for India to take a stronger stand against Russia. So far, Delhi has abstained from voting on multiple UN Security Council resolutions demanding Moscow stop its attack on Ukraine. Delhi has been reticent to condemn Russia due to its defense ties with Moscow, according to Donald Lu, the US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs. India relies on Russia for at least 50% of its military equipment -- a relationship given an increased level of importance in recent years owing to India's fraught relationship with neighbors Pakistan and China. At the same time, India is a member of Quad -- an informal defense alliance with the United States, Japan and Australia -- who have all imposed sanctions against Russia. ""All of us have been working to urge India to take a clear position, a position opposed to Russia's actions. But what have we seen so far? We have seen a number of abstentions,"" Lu said during a Senate subcommittee hearing about US-India relations on March 2. Modi has appealed to Putin for a ""cessation"" of the violence -- but has fallen short of condemning his unprovoked attack. India has also pledged humanitarian aid to Ukraine and Modi has spoken with Zelensky about the crisis. Last week, as pressure mounted on Modi, some of his supporters questioned why Gyanagoudar had ignored the government's advisories to leave and whether he was waiting for a ""private jet"" to bring him back. In a speech on February 26, before Gyanagoudar's death, Modi himself questioned why Indian students go abroad for studies, although he didn't directly refer to the Ukraine crisis. ""Our students today are going to small countries, especially for medical education. Language is a problem there... large sums of Indian money is going abroad,"" he said. His comments struck a nerve with some students stranded in Ukraine, who say they feel betrayed by his response. ""How can you say that Prime Minister? how can you say that?"" Raj, the first-year medical student said. ""We were looking forward to you (helping us), and you just said why (do) we go?"" On Monday, T. S. Tirumurti, India's Ambassador to the United Nations, emphasized India's desire for a peaceful outcome in Ukraine. ""India has been consistent in calling for an immediate end to all hostilities,"" Tirumurti said. ""We have also reiterated our urgent demand for safe and uninterrupted passage for all innocent civilians including Indian nationals remaining in Ukraine. We're deeply concerned that despite our repeated urgings to both sides, the safe corridor for our students stranded in Sumy did not materialize."" On Tuesday, Ukraine and Russia agreed a single corridor to allow civilians to evacuate Sumy south via Holubivka and Lokhvytsia to the city of Poltava. ""We call on Russia to agree on these routes immediately and ensure a stable ceasefire on these routes,"" Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories said in a statement. Indian embassy officials are waiting stationed in Poltava to help with the evacuation, the embassy said on Twitter Sunday. But the students fear they are running out of time. ""Please don't let another Naveen die,"" Raj said. ""It is very scary, we are away from our parents and no one is here to protect us.""",17,2.5179714919426868,1.6490280152819377,0.8689434766607491,1
2022-03-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/europe/ukraine-russia-weekend-summary-intl/index.html,What happened in Russia's Ukraine invasion over the weekend,"The human toll of the invasion of Ukraine mounted over the weekend as Russia upped its bombardment of civilian areas and infrastructure. As conditions worsened in a number of key Ukrainian cities, the United Nations said more than 1.5 million refugees had fled the country so far. Here's what you need to know about what happened over the weekend. Key cities bombarded as plans for evacuation corridors fail Western intelligence officials say Russia is increasing the pace and strength of strikes on key population centers, including the capital Kyiv, in an effort to bombard cities into submission. A Russian military strike hit an evacuation crossing point in the Kyiv suburb of Irpin Sunday, killing eight people, including a family with two children and several other civilians trying to flee the Russian invasion. The harrowing scenes were captured by international media, including the New York Times, filming at the checkpoint. They reported a shell landed as a stream of civilians was coming through. Heavy shelling has continued around Kyiv. The impact of explosions was heard over the weekend by CNN teams in the capital and in rural areas to the southwest. Amid the indiscriminate attacks, Kyiv appealed for international help on Sunday, saying thousands of people were isolated ""because of direct hostilities, and in some places for 5-6 days they survive without electricity, water, food, medical help and means of subsistence. They are in direct danger,"" the Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote. For the past week, civilians in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, have witnessed Russia's bombardment of residential areas as its military hones in on civilian infrastructure such as schools, shops, hospitals, apartment blocks and churches. This continued over the weekend as Kharkiv's TV tower was targeted in strikes, knocking out television and radio broadcasts, according to local authorities. Ukraine's Emergency Service said a ""bombing"" that took place on Sunday evening ""completely or partially demolished"" multi-story residential buildings, administrative buildings, medical institutions, educational institutions and dorms. There were also large-scale fires in 21 buildings in the central part of the city, it added in a statement. Meanwhile, hopes of setting up evacuation corridors for civilians in the southern city of Mariupol were dashed multiple times over the weekend after Ukraine accused Russia of continuing its attacks on those routes. Mariupol, a strategically important port city, has been under siege by Russian forces determined to tighten their grip on Ukraine's south. The city has been without power for days, and it's not clear how many of Mariupol's roughly 400,000 inhabitants have been able to evacuate. But on Sunday the International Committee of the Red Cross said attempts to evacuate some 200,000 people had failed. Also on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia was preparing to bomb the Black Sea port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine, adding that the airport in Vynnytsia, in the west of the country, had been destroyed by a rocket strike. Russia has fired a total of 600 missiles since the invasion of Ukraine began, a senior US defense official told CNN on Sunday, and has committed approximately 95% of its amassed combat power inside Ukraine. CNN has not independently confirmed these figures. Putin dials up threats against West -- as protests mount in Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday issued a series of threats against Ukraine and Western powers, in his first expansive remarks since the invasion began. ""The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they put under question the future of Ukrainian statehood,"" Putin said during a meeting with Russian flight crew members at an Aeroflot training center in Moscow. ""And if that happens, it will be entirely on their conscience."" Putin also said Western sanctions were the ""equivalent of a declaration of war,"" and warned he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine as ""participants in a military conflict."" Zelensky has repeatedly called on the US and NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but the US and NATO said this was not an option currently being considered. Meanwhile, anti-war rallies that have sprung up across Russia led to at least 4,640 people being detained on Sunday in connection with the protests, according to an independent human rights monitoring group tracking detentions. The OVD-Info group said arrests had been made in 147 cities, and since the invasion began more than 13,000 people had been arrested in Russia over the demonstrations. Harrowing insights into what Russian occupation looks like The southern port city of Kherson was seized by Russian forces last week after days of heavy bombardment and shelling. The Ukrainian flag was still hoisted on government buildings, and the mayor of the city, Ihor Kolykhaiev, remained in his post. Kolykhaiev said Saturday that Russian troops were everywhere and that the city of nearly 300,000 people was without power and water and in desperate need of humanitarian aid. Speaking to CNN, residents of Kherson under Russian occupation describe days of terror confined to their apartments and houses, fearful to go outside for even basic necessities. Russian troops are shooting at anyone who attempts to leave, according to the residents. Grocery stores have been emptied and medicine is running out, residents and officials said. On Saturday, several hundred people gathered in the city's center, with one video of the demonstrations showing people walking into Kherson's main square despite volleys of gunfire. On Sunday, further demonstrations occurred in smaller numbers. West moves to counter Russia The multinational effort to get weapons into Ukraine has seen an undisclosed airfield near the Ukrainian border become a hub for shipping weapons, a senior Defense Department official said Sunday. The airport's location remains a secret to protect the shipments of weapons, including anti-armor missiles, into Ukraine. The Russian military has not targeted these shipments once they enter Ukraine, the official said, but there is some concern Russia could begin targeting the deliveries as its assault advances. US European Command (EUCOM) is at the heart of the massive shipment operation, using its liaison network with allies and partners to coordinate ""in real time"" to send materials into Ukraine, a second Defense official said. Meanwhile, an interview with CNN on Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration was ""now talking to our European partners and allies to look in a coordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil."" He also said Sunday that the US has seen reports of Russian abuses in Ukraine that ""would constitute a war crime"" and that the Biden administration is committed to supporting investigations into the country's actions",17,1.8559648329194238,1.1237175103812482,0.7322473225381756,1
2022-03-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-07-intl/index.html,Ukraine slams Moscow's offer to evacuate civilians to Russia and Belarus as 'immoral',"Ordinary Ukrainians living in some areas under attack by Russian forces faced a cynical proposal on Monday: stay put and risk getting bombed, or leave home and head for Russia or Belarus. Ukrainian officials rejected the Kremlin's unilateral proposal for evacuation corridors for civilians as an unacceptable non-starter. Most of the routes lead to Russia or its staunch ally Belarus and would require people to travel through active areas of fighting. A spokesman for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Moscow's offer ""completely immoral"" and said Russia was trying to ""use people's suffering to create a television picture,"" Reuters reported. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk responded to Russia's announcement by demanding that Moscow ""accept options for our routes, as well as ... establish a ceasefire, which we will agree on."" Ukraine has requested that evacuation corridors are opened that largely keep citizens inside Ukraine's borders. The United Nations also led a chorus of international condemnation towards Russia's proposal on Monday. ""It's important that people be able to go where they choose and where it's safe,"" UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric told reporters, rejecting the Kremlin's proposal. Regardless, skepticism toward such corridors was growing after evacuations of civilians were paused within hours on both Saturday and Sunday when Russian forces were accused of shelling the escape routes. There were two failed attempts over the weekend to open a corridor from the besieged port of Mariupol. And on Sunday, a Russian military strike killed a family with two children as well as several other civilians trying to flee the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, according to the mayor. Ukrainian authorities said two mortar or artillery shells hit a checkpoint in Irpin, northwest of the capital, which has been the site of intense shelling by the Russian military in recent days. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said America has seen ""very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians"" in Ukraine that would be considered a war crime. In remarks to the UN Security Council Monday, Ukraine Ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya said that it was ""appalling"" that Russian troops were opening fire on evacuees after both countries had allocated certain roads to be utilized as evacuation corridors. The argument over evacuation corridors comes as Russia steps up efforts in its assault on Ukraine. Attacks on the capital, Kyiv, have intensified, while citizens in Mariupol and other key cities have been without water and food for days, unable to flee. Dominik Stillhart, the International Committee of the Red Cross's director of operations, said Monday that problems remained in confirming the details of any ceasefire agreement. Stillhart told BBC Radio 4's Today program the challenge was to get Russia and Ukraine into an agreement that is ""concrete, actionable and precise."" He added that so far there had only been agreements ""in principle,"" which had immediately broken down because they lacked precision, regarding routes and who can use them. Illustrating his point, he said some ICRC staff had tried to get out of Mariupol along an agreed route on Sunday, but soon realized ""the road indicated to them was actually mined."" Russia proposed a new ceasefire starting 10 a.m. Moscow time (2 a.m. ET Tuesday) that indicates it's ready to open evacuation corridors from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol, Russian media reported, quoting the Russian Coordination Headquarters for Humanitarian Response in Ukraine. On Monday afternoon, Ukraine had yet to formally agree to the ceasefire proposal. Earlier Monday, Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the civilian corridors leading directly to Russia were part of a personal request from French President Emmanuel Macron to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. But the Élysée Palace responded with a statement saying this was false. It added that the ""personal demand of the President of the (French) Republic, like the rest of the allies and partners, is that the Russian offensive ends."" Ukrainian deputy prime minister Vereshchuk criticized the Kremlin for its claim. ""We urge the Russian Federation to stop manipulating and abusing the trust of world leaders such as Emmanuel Macron, such as the leaders of China, Turkey or India, and to make the routes we have identified open,"" Vereshchuk said in a video statement released by the government. Martin Griffiths, the UN's Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, urged ""safe passage for civilians to leave areas of active hostilities on a voluntary basis, in the direction they choose"" on Monday. He also requested the need for ""safe passage for humanitarian supplies into areas of active hostilities,"" in a speech to the UN Security Council. ""Civilians in places like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Melitopol, and elsewhere desperately need aid, especially life-saving medical supplies. Many modalities are possible, but it must take place in line with the parties' obligations under the laws of war,"" he said.",17,1.988697684368883,3.4330740642259494,-1.4443763798570664,1
2022-03-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/europe/russia-z-symbol-ukraine-war-cmd-intl/index.html,Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbol,"In late February, days before Russian forces launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine, videos and photos began circulating on social media showing tanks, communications trucks and rocket launchers emblazoned with the letter ""Z"" rolling toward the border. Digital sleuths speculated over what the ""Z,"" written in the Roman alphabet rather than Cyrillic, might indicate about Moscow's next moves. Military experts interpreted the ""Z"" as ""Za pobedy,"" Russian for ""for victory,"" or as ""Zapad,"" for ""West."" Some dubbed vehicles painted with the symbol the ""Zorro Squad,"" while others suggested the ""Z"" might stand for the Kremlin's self-styled ""target number one,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Aric Toler, a researcher with Bellingcat, an open source investigative operation that has been monitoring Russian military operations since Moscow fomented a war in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, said on February 20 that the group had no idea what the ""Z"" symbol meant and had not seen it used before. ""So, assume the worst, I guess/fear,"" he wrote on Twitter. Russian defense policy expert Rob Lee, who has been tracking the ""Z"" vehicles since troops began massing on Ukraine's doorstep, suggested the symbol might refer to military contingents assigned to the fight in the country. ""It appears Russian forces near the border are painting markers, in this case 'Z', on vehicles to identify different task forces or echelons,"" Lee, a PhD student at King's College London's War Studies Department, tweeted on February 19. But in the days since Moscow ordered the bloody assault on Ukraine, what started as a mysterious military symbol has become a sign of popular support for the war in Russia, and what analysts describe as the unfurling of a chilling new nationalist movement. Russians have daubed the ""Z"" on their cars, sported black hoodies emblazoned with the symbol, and fashioned makeshift ""Z"" brooches on lapels -- a sign that there is some popular support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his efforts to expand Moscow's sphere of influence by seizing parts of Ukraine. ""Authorities launched a propaganda campaign to gain popular support for their invasion of Ukraine and they're getting lots of it,"" Kamil Galeev, an independent researcher and former fellow at the Wilson Center, a non-partisan policy think tank in Washington, DC, wrote in a comprehensive Twitter thread on the use of the ""Z"" symbol in propaganda videos and by Russians on social media. ""This symbol invented just a few days ago became a symbol of new Russian ideology and national identity,"" Galeev added. As the Kremlin tightens its grip on any news of Russian casualties or setbacks making its way back home -- enforcing an extraordinary new law that makes the spread of ""fake"" information an offense punishable with jail terms -- Putin's backers are ramping up their support for the war. At a hospice in Kazan, a city in Russia's southwest Tatarstan region, children dying from cancer were asked to line up in a ""Z"" formation outside in the snow to show their support for the Russian military operation. ""Our patients and entire team took part in it, about 60 people in total. People lined up in the form of the letter 'Z,'"" Vladimir Vavilov, the chairman of a cancer charity that runs the hospice, said in a statement. ""In our left hand we held leaflets with the flags of the LPR, DPR, Russia and Tatarstan and we clenched our right hand into a fist."" Vavilov was referring to the Luhansk People's Republic and the Donetsk People's Republic, separatist-held areas of eastern Ukraine that Putin recognized last month as independent states as part of a pretext for invading the country. The ""Z"" symbol has also cropped up among members of Russia's lower house of Parliament, the Duma. Maria Butina was convicted of serving as an unregistered foreign agent in the United States trying to infiltrate prominent conservative political circles before and after the 2016 election. She now represents the Kirov region for the Putin-supporting United Russia political party, and has backed the war in posts on her Telegram channel. Butina took to the platform to share a clip of herself drawing a white ""Z"" on the lapel of her blazer, and has updated her profile to a selfie in a black T-shirt with a white letter ""Z."" ""Keep up the work, brothers. We are with you. Forever,"" she said in the video clip, clenching her fist. Correspondents reporting from Ukraine for Russian state-owned news network Rossiya-24 have sported the ""Z"" on flak jackets. Footage from Russia's main cities shared over the weekend captured convoys of cars with white ""Z""s taped to windows, honking horns and flying huge Russian flags. At the Gymnastics World Cup in Doha, Qatar, Russian athlete Ivan Kuliak sported the insignia on the medals podium as he stood beside Ukraine's Illia Kovtun, the gold medalist. And in two slickly produced propaganda videos circulating on social media, young Russians wearing black T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts emblazoned with the letter ""Z"" and hashtag #СвоихНеБросаем, or ""we don't abandon our own (guys),"" wave Russian flags and voice their support of Putin's war, chanting: ""For Russia, for the president. For Russia, for Putin!""",14,4.011995774944229,4.460713774362767,-0.4487179994185375,17
2022-03-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/06/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html,'A family died... in front of my eyes': Civilians killed as Russian military strike hits evacuation route in Kyiv suburb,"A Russian military strike hit an evacuation crossing point in a Kyiv suburb Sunday, killing a family with two children and several other civilians trying to flee the Russian invasion, according to the city's mayor, as civilian casualties seeking safety from the onslaught continue to rise. Two mortar or artillery shells hit the checkpoint in the suburb of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities said, which has been the site of intense shelling by the Russian military in recent days. Irpin Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said eight civilians have been killed across the district, and international media filming at the checkpoint reported that a shell landed as a stream of civilians was coming through. ""A family died,"" Markushyn said in a statement. ""In front of my eyes, two small children and two adults died."" Video from the moment the strike killed a family shows a Ukrainian soldier standing outside a building on a street. Suddenly, an explosion is seen and heard on the video. Debris is heard raining down on the building and the street is obscured by a dust cloud. A number of journalists are heard reacting to the strike. As the scene begins clearing, someone is seen pulling the Ukrainian soldier away. Other soldiers run across the street and appear to be checking the condition of a number of individuals on the ground. ""Medic,"" someone is heard repeatedly screaming. Photographs from the Associated Press showed bodies on the ground covered by sheets, with suitcases standing upright nearby. CNN has determined the civilians were killed in the Russian military strike seen in the video. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration appealed to international organizations for help in resolving a growing humanitarian crisis. ""Thousands of people found themselves in isolation, because of direct hostilities, and in some places for 5-6 days they survive without electricity, water, food, medical help and means of subsistence. They are in direct danger,"" it said. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Sunday that more than 360 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began, while acknowledging that the real figure is likely ""considerably higher."" CNN cannot independently verify the casualty numbers. The UN also reports more than 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24. Evacuation corridors closed In the country's southeast, hopes that a second attempt to open up safe evacuation routes for civilians in Mariupol and Volnovakha might succeed -- after a first effort failed on Saturday -- were dashed within hours. The governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Facebook on Sunday that the planned ""evacuation convoy with local residents was never able to leave Mariupol today: the Russians began to regroup their forces and heavy shelling of the city. It is extremely dangerous to evacuate people in such conditions."" Kyrylenko added that a convoy carrying humanitarian aid from the central city of Zaporizhzhia, three hours from Mariupol, ""has not yet reached its destination and is currently on its way."" The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also said Sunday's planned evacuation in Mariupol had failed. ""Today, our team began opening up the evacuation route from Mariupol before hostilities resumed. We remain in Mariupol and are ready to help facilitate further attempts -- if the parties reach an agreement, which is for them alone to implement and respect,"" the ICRC said on Twitter. ""People in Mariupol and in other places across #Ukraine are living in desperate situations. They must be protected at all times. They are not a target. People urgently need water, food, shelter. The basics of life. We need safety guarantees to be able to bring them aid."" Ukrainian lawmaker Inna Sovsun claimed Sunday that Russian forces had damaged a gas pipeline in southeastern Ukraine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without heat in bitter temperatures. ""Donetsk-Mariupol gas pipeline was damaged by #Russian occupants. Now, more than 750,000 of people are left without any heat, while it's still often below 0°C (32 degrees Fahrenheit) outside,"" Sovsun said on Twitter. Separately, television and radio broadcasts have been knocked out in Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, after Russian military strikes, according to the Regional Administration. In a post on Facebook Sunday, the Regional Administration said ""repeated shelling"" of the TV tower in Kharkiv had knocked out broadcasting capabilities. Russia has fired a total of 600 missiles since the invasion of Ukraine began, a senior US defense official told CNN on Sunday, and has committed approximately 95% of its amassed combat power inside Ukraine. Earlier Sunday, heavy shelling was reported to the west and northwest of Kyiv. The impact of explosions was heard by CNN teams in Kyiv and in rural areas to the southwest. ""They (Russian troops) captured Hostomel and Bucha yesterday (Saturday). The Russians entered there,"" said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in the Ukrainian President's Office, referring to two suburbs northwest of Kyiv. ""They have injured many children and do not allow to evacuate them, despite numerous appeals at the highest state level to provide a 'green corridor' from Bucha and Irpin. There are many children in the basements."" Arestovych described the situation as a ""catastrophe,"" adding that discussions were going on ""at the highest level with international humanitarian institutions, through mediators with the Russians"" in order to find a way out for those who are trapped. Several children have died, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Health. Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Sunday that Russia was preparing to bomb the Black Sea port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine and said the airport in Vynnytsia, in the west of the country, had been destroyed by a rocket strike. In an address broadcast on Facebook, Zelensky said: ""Russian people always used to come to Odessa and they only knew warmth and generosity and what's now? Artillery, bombs against Odessa. This will be a war crime. This will be (a) historic crime."" In a separate message, Zelensky again appealed for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine, following the destruction of Vynnytsia's airport. ""They continue to ruin our infrastructure our life, which we have built, and our parents, and grandparents, many generations of Ukrainians. We repeat every day -- close the skies over Ukraine,"" he added. US and European officials have been discussing how the West would support a government in exile helmed by Zelensky should he have to flee Kyiv, Western officials told CNN. The discussions have ranged from supporting Zelensky and top Ukrainian officials in a potential move to Lviv in western Ukraine, to the possibility that Zelensky and his aides are forced to flee Ukraine altogether and establish a new government in Poland, the officials said. Western officials have been wary of discussing a government in exile directly with Zelensky because he wants to stay in Kyiv and has so far rejected conversations that focus on anything other than boosting Ukraine in its fight against Russia, two Western diplomats said. Calls for more support As the Russian invasion continues, Zelensky has reiterated his pleas for US and NATO assistance in establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine -- a move which could prevent Russian forces from carrying out airstrikes against the country. But there are fears such a move could be seen as an escalation, with Russian President Vladimir Putin warning on Saturday he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine as ""participants in a military conflict."" Zelensky has repeatedly asked NATO and Western officials to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but both say they oppose such a move. In an impassioned call to US lawmakers Saturday, Zelensky also encouraged Eastern European nations to provide Ukraine with fighter jets, stressing they were needed to defend against Russian aggression. On the call, Zelensky said if the West won't impose a no-fly zone they should give Ukraine planes. A White House spokesperson confirmed the United States is working with Poland on the possibility of Warsaw providing fighter jets to Ukraine. Some Biden administration officials privately fear that this move could be viewed by the Russians as an escalation, US officials say. Meanwhile, a multinational effort to send weapons to Ukraine is running at top speed at an undisclosed airfield in Eastern Europe, a defense official said. The US European Command is at the heart of the operation, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley met last week with troops and personnel to examine the weapons shipments activity, the official said. Since the invasion, 14 countries have sent security assistance to Ukraine, a senior US defense official said Friday, some of which had rarely sent such substantial equipment before. Putin claimed Saturday that Russia had almost completed the destruction of Ukrainian air defense systems, and added that Western sanctions were the ""equivalent of a declaration of war."" Speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US has seen ""very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians"" in Ukraine that would be considered a war crime. He added that the US is working with its allies in Europe to look into the possibility of banning Russian oil imports in an effort to further punish the country for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.",17,4.836718619961362,2.0141367838923876,2.822581836068974,1
2022-03-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/06/europe/civil-disobedience-ukraine-russian-occupation-cmd-intl/index.html,Defiance and disobedience are flourishing in Russian-held Ukraine,"While the Ukrainian military's resistance against Russia's invasion has been well-documented, the last few days have seen growing popular defiance of Russian forces. In the south of Ukraine, especially, there have been multiple protests in areas where Russian troops have arrived. At least several hundred people gathered in the center of Kherson on Saturday to protest the Russian occupation of the Black Sea port. One video of the demonstrations showed people walking into Kherson's main square despite the occasional volley of gunfire. Where that gunfire came from is unclear, but a small detachment of Russian soldiers is seen guarding the Regional Council building. The protesters chanted ""Ukrainia,"" and the largest cheer went up when a young man waving Ukraine's blue-and-yellow flag scrambled onto a Russian troop carrier. One man who attended the protests managed to send a sequence of videos to CNN, saying in broken English: ""People want to show that Kherson is Ukraine, and all brave people go into this meeting, not afraid of Russian military."" There was a further demonstration in Kherson on Sunday. Videos from this event suggest it was smaller but no less determined. An elderly woman looked steadily into the camera in one video and said quietly: ""Save our country! Let them all die, together with Putin."" The protests in Kherson this weekend were the largest and latest in a growing tide of confrontations in the few Ukrainian towns and cities of any size that Russian forces have taken. They may be an ominous sign for Russian commanders already struggling to break down Ukrainian military resistance. And, despite the risk, this civil disobedience is being urged on from above. On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Facebook message: ""Everyone who can defend their city must continue to fight. Must. Because if everyone leaves, then whose city will it be?"" And, on Sunday, hundreds of people heeded Zelensky's call and took part in marches throughout the Kherson region, which is close to Russian-controlled Crimea. In the city of Nova Kakhovka, a crowd cheered as an elderly woman brandished a broom and dustpan as a welcome to Russian troops. Two men scrambled up a plinth to raise the Ukrainian flag outside the city hall. Later, video emerged of smoke rising from among the crowd amid the sound of gunfire. The Ukrainian news agency Interfax said five people had been injured after Russian forces opened fire -- apparently above the protestors' heads -- and used stun grenades. It seemed like almost every town in Kherson was out on Sunday. In Novooleksiika, hundreds sang the national anthem and shouted ""Ukraine is above all"" as they walked down a rural road. And in Kalanchak, which lies closer to Crimea, hundreds of people sang the national anthem and shouted ""Ukraine is above all"" as they walked down a rural road -- with multiple generations of locals bound together in national solidarity. They then unfurled a huge Ukrainian flag and harangued masked and heavily armed Russian soldiers. Women shouted, ""Get out of our land, we don't need you! Get out of our land!"" Since the middle of last week there have been protests against Russia, often involving just a few dozen people, from Berdyansk on Ukraine's south coast to Konotop, hundreds of miles north between Kyiv and Kharkiv. When the Russian military arrived in Konotop, a small crowd swarmed a Russian military vehicle, yelling abuse. One climbed onto its hood and then tumbled off as it sped away. In Berdyansk, a crowd sang the Ukrainian national anthem outside the city hall, which was occupied by Russian troops last week. Bolder civilians confronted soldiers in a truck, who seemed bewildered. Individual acts of defiance are going viral in a country where the internet and mobile communications remain largely intact, much to the surprise of most people. The footage spread rapidly through Telegram and Facebook -- short, uneven clips where the raw courage of protesters punches through. These are all scattered examples, and they don't amount to organized resistance. But they do demonstrate genuine defiance and opposition to the new order that Russian forces are trying to impose as they gradually take more territory. The quandary for the occupying force is finding local officials willing to work under their direction to maintain services in towns and cities where food and medical supplies are running short. The Russians seem poorly prepared to install local administrations. In most cases so far, Russian troops have kept a low profile in the face of civilian protests. They have stood their ground but not reacted. But not always. In a town in the eastern region of Luhansk, which is largely Russian-speaking, residents took to the streets of Novopskov on Friday. ""Get out of here! War and death are following you,"" they chanted. They came back for more on Saturday, when Russian troops shot one man in the leg and fired volleys into the air to disperse a crowd approaching their position. What's unclear is whether the Russians can both control the cities they are beginning to occupy and try to drive forward across this vast country. Russian forces are already experiencing supply issues, according to US officials. Crushing Ukrainian military resistance as well as subduing an emboldened population would be a tall order.",14,3.056759877537505,3.215215667223303,-0.1584557896857981,15
2022-03-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/05/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-saturday-intl/index.html,Putin dials up threats against Ukraine and Western powers as stalled evacuations trap thousands,"Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a series of threats against Ukraine and Western powers Saturday, as Ukrainian officials accused Russia of shelling evacuation routes out of two battered cities. Ukrainian authorities said thousands of civilians remained trapped in the southeastern cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha and accused Russian forces of breaching an agreement to pause fire to allow safe passage out. Putin, meanwhile, used a meeting with Russian flight crew members at an Aeroflot training center in Moscow, to make his first expansive remarks since the invasion nine days ago. ""The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they put under question the future of Ukrainian statehood,"" Putin said. ""And if that happens, it will be entirely on their conscience."" Putin also said Western sanctions were the ""equivalent of a declaration of war,"" and warned he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine as ""participants in a military conflict."" President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly pleaded with NATO and Western officials to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a move which could prevent Russian forces from carrying out airstrikes against their country. But NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday that a no-fly zone is not an option being considered by the alliance. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that establishing such a zone could lead to a ""full-fledged war in Europe,"" but added Washington would continue to work with its allies to provide Ukrainians with the means to defend themselves from Russian aggression. Late Saturday, a White House spokesperson confirmed to CNN that the US is working with Poland on the possibility of Poland providing fighter jets to Ukraine, as President Zelensky is pushing for eastern European countries to send fighter aircraft into his country. As part of the conversations with Poland, the US is determining what ""capabilities we could provide to backfill Poland if it decided to transfer planes to Ukraine,"" said the spokesperson, who would not detail what backfill options are under consideration. The spokesperson said sending fighter jets into Ukraine is a ""sovereign decision for any country to make"" and noted there are a host of logistics to work through, including how the aircraft would be transferred from Poland to Ukraine. Two lawmakers participating in a zoom call with the Ukrainian president earlier Saturday said Zelensky said Poland has signaled its prepared to send MiG fighter jets but that ""they are only waiting for you [the US] to allow it."" Stalled evacuation effort The Russian Ministry of Defense said earlier Saturday it would stop bombarding Mariupol and Volnovakha, which have endured days of heavy, indiscriminate shelling. Residents there have hunkered down in basements without power and with limited supplies of food and water, volunteers gathering information from the ground told CNN. But just a few hours after the announcement to pause fire, a top regional official accused Russia of breaking its agreement. ""Due to the fact that the Russians are not observing the ceasefire regime and continue shelling Mariupol and its outskirts, the evacuation of the population has been postponed for security reasons,"" governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, announced on Twitter. Iryna Vereshchuk, the Ukrainian minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, said Saturday that about 200,000 people were to be evacuated from Mariupol and a further 15,000 from Volnovakha. Kyrylenko said 400 people were evacuated from Volnovakha and surrounding villages on Saturday, adding that while the authorities ""intended to evacuate a much larger number of people, the convoy had to stop moving as the Russians resumed the ruthless shelling of Volnovakha and it was extremely dangerous to move there."" Meanwhile, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said in a statement that just as the city was ready to begin evacuations of its residents to Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro, Russian forces ""began shelling along the corridor, where we were supposed to go."" ""This morning we received a confirmation from the Russian Federation, from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, that the corridor from Mariupol to the cities of Zaporizhzhia and the Dnipro is safe. We received a guarantee of ceasefire regime ... there is no ceasefire regime now,"" he said. ""This does not give us a sense of security for going to Zaporizhzhia."" Later Saturday, in a interview on a YouTube channel, Boichenko painted a grim picture of life in the city. Boichenko said the city, with a population of nearly 400,000, had been without power for five days. He said there were no mobile networks, and ""since the attack on Mariupol, we lost our reserve water supply, and so we are totally without water now."" He said the ""wounded and dead over these past five days number in the dozens. By the eighth day there were hundreds. Now we are already talking about thousands."" He added: ""These figures are only going to get worse. But this is the sixth straight day of airstrikes and we are not able to get out to recover the dead."" Later on Saturday, in a statement carried by Russian news agency TASS, General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said that ""not a single civilian was able to leave Mariupol and Volnovakha along the announced security corridors,"" that Russian forces had resumed their offensive, and blamed ""the Ukrainian side."" At the same time, Ukrainians -- including children, and elderly men and women -- managed to escape Kyiv on Saturday by crossing a damaged bridge on the northwestern outskirts of the capital. The bridge, connecting the suburb of Irpin to central Kyiv, was blown up by Ukrainian forces to prevent Russian forces from using it to enter the city. As a result, civilians fleeing a week of heavy bombardment were forced to scramble over heaped rubble and twisted metal to make their way to the other side. Some appeared exhausted and visibly distressed, struggling to balance as they hauled their bags up the steep slope. 'There are corpses lying around' CNN received a written account from a resident of a village near Volnovakha, whose husband has been trying to evacuate people from the city in recent days. ""The situation in the city is very scary,"" Marina Gasanova wrote. ""There is almost nothing left in the city, something comes in every minute from all sides, it is not clear what ... and it is not clear from where it comes. Scary, crazy!"" she wrote. ""Every minute, every second, everyone is shooting. From all sides. It's just impossible! There are corpses lying around, torn-off arms, torn-off legs."" Vereshchuk said that according to reports from her country's military, Russian forces were using the pause in fire to continue their advance. She stressed that the corridors were being used to evacuate civilians, including women and children, and to deliver aid, like medicine and food. ""The whole world is watching this. I sincerely hope that such a first step, which I hope will end positively and people will get shelter, but not sit for weeks under the rubble, in basements without water, without communication and without food, will continue,"" she said. Earlier on Saturday, Zelensky pleaded for the evacuation corridors to work to save people, but he also said that those ""who can defend their city must continue to fight."" Doctors Without Borders (MSF) issued a statement on Saturday pleading for the evacuation corridors to remain open. The statement included an account from a MSF staff member in Mariupol, who said the situation in the city was getting desperate. ""We collected snow and rain water yesterday to have some utility water. We tried to get free water today but the queue was huge ... multiple grocery stores were destroyed by missiles and the remaining things were taken by people in desperate need,"" it read. ""Still no power, water, heating and mobile connection. No one heard about any evacuation yet. Pharmacies are out of medicine.""",17,1.6951341591143467,2.6198880616776203,-0.9247539025632736,1
2022-03-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/world/russia-mercenaries-ukraine/index.html,"Russia poised to deploy up to 1,000 more mercenaries to Ukraine as official warns Moscow could 'bombard cities into submission'","Russia is poised to deploy up to 1,000 more mercenaries to Ukraine in the coming days and weeks, as a senior Western intelligence official warned Moscow could ""bombard cities into submission,"" an escalation that could lead to significant civilian casualties. The US has already seen ""some indications"" that Russian mercenaries may be involved in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine ""in some places,"" a senior defense official said earlier this week, but it wasn't clear exactly where or in what numbers. ""We've seen some indications that they're being employed,"" the official said. Now a US official tells CNN that Russia is planning to deploy up to 1,000 more mercenaries in the near future. Some Russian forces have struggled with morale issues and setbacks on the battlefield, including a massive convoy north of Kyiv that has remained largely stalled for the past several days. The mercenary forces would fortify the flagging units, the official said, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its second weekend. The official added that the US believes the mercenaries already in Ukraine have ""performed poorly when facing the stiffer-than-expected resistance from the Ukrainians,"" and that as many as 200 such mercenaries have already been killed in the war as of late February. Meanwhile, US and western officials expect Russia to increase the pace and strength of its strikes on key Ukrainian population centers, including the capital of Kyiv, from which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has broadcast steady but defiant messages against Russia's aggression. Russia now seems prepared to ""bombard cities into submission,"" one senior western intelligence official said on Friday, which could include a significant increase in the number of civilian casualties. ""It's a very crude approach,"" the official said. ""The heavier weapons are not just heavier in the weight, they're also heavier in terms of the damage that they can inflict. And they're far less discriminant."" Other officials have noticed a shift in Russian strategy from military targets to civilians, with more attacks becoming focused on population centers. The new approach comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to get the quick victory he wanted, and the Russian military has faced a stiff and determined Ukrainian resistance across the country. In the face of the resistance, the attacks will increase, officials warned. ""The days to come are likely to be worse, with more death, more suffering, and more destruction, as the Russian armed forces bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the sentiment during a news conference in Brussels Friday where he is meeting with European allies. ""The Kremlin's attacks are inflicting an ever-increasing toll on civilians there,"" Blinken said. ""Hundreds if not thousands of Ukrainians have been killed, many more wounded, as have citizens of other countries. More than a million refugees have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries. Millions of people across Ukraine are trapped in increasingly dire conditions as Russia destroys more critical infrastructure.""",14,4.486408187054217,5.6034104121458626,-1.1170022250916452,12

Ukrainians describe terror of living under Russian occupation,"A volley of machine-gun fire erupted just as Andriy Abba's family raised a toast to celebrate his 30th birthday in Kherson. Wine glass in hand, he rushed with his parents and younger brother to the basement. Outside, Russian troops were in the final throes of occupying their city -- the first to fall to Moscow since its bloody invasion began a week ago. As the day wore on, Abba said, the rattling of bullets and thuds of explosion began to fade. At around midnight, silence descended on the city. ""And that's when we knew,"" Abba told CNN. ""It was very sad."" Kherson, a key port city on the Black Sea, in southern Ukraine, was overrun by Russian forces in the early hours of Wednesday, after days of heavy bombardment and shelling. The Ukrainian flag was still hoisted on government buildings, and the mayor of the city, Ihor Kolykhaiev, remained in his post. On Saturday, Kolykhaiev announced that Russian troops were everywhere, and the city of nearly 300,000 people was without power and water, and in desperate need of humanitarian aid. Kolykhaiev said that the Russian forces had ""settled in"" to the city, and showed no signs of leaving. ""We have a lot of people here in need. We have cancer patients. Children who need medication. This medication is not currently getting through to them,"" he told CNN, adding that the Russians wanted to send aid, but residents were refusing it. People living in Kherson under Russian occupation describe days of terror confined to their apartments and houses, fearful to go outside for even basic necessities -- their city now a dystopian shell of the home they knew and loved. Checkpoints manned by Russian troops pepper the city's streets, five Kherson residents told CNN in recent phone calls. The roads are virtually empty because inhabitants have either fled the fighting, or are staying indoors for fear of encountering Russian soldiers. Grocery stores have been emptied and medicine is running out, residents and officials said. Russian troops have encircled the city and are shooting at anyone who attempts to leave, according to the residents, including a top local health official who CNN is not naming for security reasons. On Thursday, Russian forces shot two men at a checkpoint after they attempted to pass, killing one and seriously wounding the other, the official told CNN. Russian troops have also prohibited ambulances from leaving the city's perimeters to reach villages in the province, according to the official. A woman going through a long and dangerous labor in the outskirts of the city had to resort to a panicked video consultation with her doctor because Russian forces had blocked a medical team trying to assist with the birth, the official said. ""After about a day of the local authorities begging the Russians, the mother and the child were allowed to pass to the hospital,"" said the official. ""It was horrible."" Andriy Abba, who works as a tax lawyer, says he is determined to stay in Kherson regardless of the occupation, for as long as the Ukrainian flag remains flying on government buildings. ""Even if we wanted to evacuate women and children from here, it's just plain impossible,"" he added. ""They shoot at anyone who tries to leave."" Ukrainian authorities have been working to establish the safe exit of civilians from besieged areas in ongoing negotiations with Moscow. Russia agreed to hold fire Saturday from 9 a.m. Kyiv time, and create humanitarian corridors allowing residents to escape the southern cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha -- the first tangible sign of cooperation. But the agreement quickly fell apart, stalling evacuations, Ukrainian officials said. The government accused Russian forces of shelling the cities, and even targeting the evacuation corridors out of them. ""Surrounded cities that are being destroyed"" are ""experiencing the worst days,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement on Saturday. ""Humanitarian corridors must work today. Mariupol and Volnovakha. To save people. Women, children, the elderly. To give food and medicine to those who remain."" Yulia Alekseeva, a mother of a two-month-old, said she is struggling to find diapers and other baby products. ""There are catastrophically few in the city. We also have a grandmother with dementia who needs diapers and medicines on an ongoing basis, which are also not available,"" she told CNN. Like most of the city's residents, Alekseeva has hunkered down with her family, leaving her house only to search for basic necessities. ""We are in hiding. There is a curfew in the city, if people go out after eight in the evening, they shoot to kill. You can move in the company of no more than two people,"" she said. But she remains defiant, adding: ""The Ukrainian flag is still over Kherson, the city did not surrender to the invaders. The military said not to provoke them and everyone would be alive."" On Saturday, a large crowd of protesters took to the occupied streets of Kherson, waving Ukrainian flags and coming face-to-face with Russian forces. The troops appeared to fire live bullets in the air to disperse the crowds, social media video showed. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba shared footage of the scenes on Twitter, praising the demonstrators. ""Courageous Kherson inspires Ukraine and the world! Thousands of peaceful Ukrainians protests Russian occupation in front of armed Russian soldiers. What a spirit,"" he wrote Saturday. From her apartment in Kherson where she cares for her grandmother, Svetlana Zorina told CNN she would stay in the city ""for as long as the Ukrainian flag stands and the mayor is Ukrainian."" On Friday, she went to the grocery store only to find empty shelves, and then headed to the apartment of her mother, who is abroad, where she collected pasta and rice. ""We are, here, very afraid that we will become part of Russia. We don't want history to repeat like with Crimea,"" she said, referring to Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014. ""We're less afraid to be under bombs than to become a part of Russia."" It's something Abba is convinced won't happen in his city. Though he is consumed with fears of Russian annexation, he argued that in contrast to Crimea, which fell relatively bloodlessly, Kherson has put up a stiff resistance to occupation. ""The Russians have crossed a line multiple times,"" he said. ""There cannot be [another] Crimea.""",17,3.884319014034188,4.011931149732055,-0.12761213569786678,1
2022-03-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/politics/putin-war-crimes-russia-ukraine-us-what-matters/index.html,Here's how war crimes prosecutions work,"Shocking atrocities in Ukraine, allegedly at the hands of Russian forces, have amplified calls to pursue war crimes charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Images of at least 20 bodies strewn across the street in Bucha, Ukraine, emerged in early April following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to call for an end to Russian ""war crimes."" And at least 50 deaths from a Russian missile strike on a railway station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk -- where civilians were waiting for evacuation trains to safer regions of the country -- led Zelensky to say, ""We expect a firm, global response to this war crime."" Already, there was a loud and growing chorus of calls for the International Criminal Court to pursue Putin for the unprovoked invasion, and the US government in March formally declared that members of the Russian armed forces have committed war crimes. The top war crimes prosecutor for the ICC has traveled to Ukraine to investigate, and the US Embassy in Kyiv argued in the war's opening days that specific Russian attacks constituted war crimes. ""It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant,"" the embassy said on its official Twitter feed on March 4. ""Putin's shelling of Europe's largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further."" Russia's bombing of hospitals and a theater where children were seeking refuge along with its suspected use of cluster bombs and so-called vacuum bombs in dense areas with many civilians have also been described as war crimes. ""The law is clear on this, it is a crime to intentionally target civilians, it is a crime to intentionally target civilian objects,"" Karim Khan, the ICC's chief prosecutor, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. But Khan added there is a burden of proof and a process that must play out. Here's a very broad look at war crimes and the international justice movement. Note: Some of what's below comes from CNN's research library, which compiled information about the International Criminal Court. What is a war crime? The International Criminal Court has specific definitions for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. Read about them in this guide published by the ICC. Specifically, targeting civilian populations, violating the Geneva Conventions, targeting specific groups of people and more could be potential Russian war crimes. Khan said there can be justified attacks in civilian areas if they are being used to launch attacks. But even then, he said, attacks in civilian areas cannot be disproportionate. There is a method of gathering evidence from testimony, satellite images and elsewhere to meet a burden of proof. What is the International Criminal Court? Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute first brought before the United Nations, the International Criminal Court operates independently. Most countries on Earth -- 123 of them -- are parties to the treaty, but there are very large and notable exceptions, including Russia and the US. And, for that matter, Ukraine. Who can be tried by the court? Anyone accused of a crime in the jurisdiction of the court, which includes countries that are members of the ICC, can be tried. The court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility: leaders and officials. While Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has previously accepted its jurisdiction. Putin could, therefore, theoretically be indicted by the court for previously ordering war crimes in Crimea. However, the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia, so he would either have to be handed over by Russia or arrested outside of Russia. That seems unlikely. What crimes does the court handle? The ICC is meant to be a court of ""last resort"" and is not meant to replace a country's justice system. The court, which has 18 judges serving nine-year terms, tries four types of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes. How does the ICC bring proceedings? Court proceedings can be brought in one of two ways: Either a national government or the UN Security Council can refer cases for investigation. Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has veto power over council actions. It was requests by 39 national governments, most of them European, that sparked this current investigation. Khan previously told CNN, ""I want to emphasize that I'm willing to speak to all sides, and not just the Ukrainian side, but also the Russian Federation, state parties and non-state parties alike. This institution is not political. We're not part of the geostrategic or geopolitical divisions that we witness around the world."" What will the ICC investigate in relation to Ukraine? In its new investigation into Russia's possible war crimes, the ICC has said it will look at all actions in Ukraine from 2013 to the present. Russia first entered Crimea, which has been part of Ukraine, in 2014. The ICC was already investigating crackdowns on protesters by a previous Ukrainian government that was pro-Russian. This new referral seems to put all potential war crimes together. How long do these investigations take? If justice in general moves slowly, international justice barely moves at all. Investigations at the ICC take many years. Only a handful of convictions have ever been won. A preliminary investigation into the hostilities in eastern Ukraine lasted more than six years -- from April 2014 until December 2020. At the time, the prosecutor said there was evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Next steps were slowed by the Covid-19 pandemic and a lack of resources at the court, which is conducting multiple investigations. That perception of slow and ineffective justice will test the system of international law, Khan told Cooper. ""This is a test for the court. It's a test for me, it's a test for the office,"" he said. What are cluster bombs and vacuum bombs? In addition to attacks on hospitals and civilian apartment buildings, the feared use of banned weapons meant to kill without discrimination is another very specific war crime. With a cluster bomb, a missile is fired and explodes thousands of feet in the air, releasing smaller bombs that each detonate when they fall to the ground. See an illustration from The Washington Post. Amnesty International said a Russian cluster bomb fell on a Ukrainian preschool. ""Vacuum bombs,"" or thermobaric weapons, suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects. Russia previously used them in Chechnya. 'This is genocide' Now, Russia is facing more accusations of war crimes after its forces began retreating from areas near Kyiv, including Bucha, following a failed bid to encircle the capital. Asked during an appearance on CBS in early April if Russia was carrying out genocide in his country based on the images out of Bucha, Zelensky said: ""Indeed. This is genocide."" The alleged atrocities in Bucha have drawn outrage from leaders outside of Ukraine, with Western leaders, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, calling for war crimes investigations and increasing sanctions on Russia. ""Since the aggression, we've come out and said that we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes, and we've been working to document that, to provide the information we have to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together. And there needs to be accountability for it,"" he told CNN. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the deaths. Why would a Ukraine prosecution be different? The international outcry against Russia is unique, and that could give the court the ability to operate differently, according to Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University and co-editor-in-chief of Just Security, an online forum. ""It's hard to judge the ICC's investigation based on past practice,"" Goodman said in an email after the court initially launched its investigation. ""In the Ukraine situation, the prosecutor is buttressed by an extraordinary outpouring of support from dozens of countries, which I expect will be followed by an infusion of resources."" How would an ICC case affect the conflict? ""For better or for worse, the ICC investigation may affect the diplomatic space for negotiations,"" said Goodman, arguing Putin and other Russians might not want to risk arrest if they travel outside the country. The investigation could also, he argued, weaken Putin at home. ""Russians may come to realize this is another reason Putin can no longer serve their country,"" Goodman said. What happened before the ICC? Previous trials for war crimes were brought by special UN tribunals, such as those empaneled for the former Yugoslavia, focusing on the Serbian autocrat Slobodan Milosevic, and for the Rwandan genocide. All of this stems from the precedent of the Nuremberg trials to bring Nazis to justice after World War II and held by the Allies, including the US, the Soviet Union, France and Germany. So it is interesting that neither the US nor Russia are members of the ICC. Why aren't the US and Russia ICC members? Both the US and Russia are signatories to the treaty that created the court -- meaning their leaders signed it -- but neither is a member of the court. Russia pulled out of the court in 2016 days after an ICC report published what CNN called a ""damning verdict"" on Russia's occupation of Crimea in 2014. The court also launched a probe in 2016 into Russia's 2008 efforts to support breakaway regions in Georgia. At the time, France had also accused Russia of committing war crimes in Syria. As for the US, while President Bill Clinton signed the treaty creating the court in 2000, he never recommended the Senate ratify it. The George W. Bush administration, to a fair amount of criticism, pulled the US from being a party to the treaty in 2002. The Pentagon and many US policymakers have long opposed joining such an international court system since it could open US servicemembers to allegations of war crimes. ""The president (George W. Bush) thinks the ICC is fundamentally flawed because it puts American servicemen and women at fundamental risk of being tried by an entity that is beyond America's reach, beyond America's laws and can subject American civilians and military to arbitrary standards of justice,"" then-White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said at the time. How has the US supported the court? Opposing America joining the court did not mean the Bush administration opposed the court itself. It supported ICC efforts to seek justice for genocide in Sudan. There has always been an awkwardness to how American presidents deal with the court, noted CNN's Tim Lister in 2011. He wrote about Barac",13,6.723078716983587,2.295750140121275,4.427328576862312,19
2022-03-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/europe/nato-no-fly-zone-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html,What is NATO and why hasn't it imposed a no-fly zone in Ukraine?,"The 30 member countries of NATO met in Brussels on Friday to discuss the alliance's next steps in Ukraine. Diplomatic efforts have failed to end chaos in the country, eight days after Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to invade. The situation inside Ukraine seems unlikely to improve any time soon. A 40-mile Russian convoy headed for the capital, Kyiv, has been stalled for days as Ukrainian fighters hold key areas, while Russian troops have claimed other key strategic areas and, as of this morning, are occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Despite the bleak situation on the ground, NATO is unwilling to get directly involved in the conflict -- including setting up a no-fly zone -- beyond supporting Ukraine's resistance to an invasion that is killing innocent civilians. NATO's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Friday that a no-fly zone over Ukraine is not an option being considered by the alliance. ""We've agreed that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory,"" he said. What is NATO? The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a group of 30 North American and European nations. According to NATO, its purpose ""is to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means."" The alliance was created in 1949 in response to the start of the Cold War. Its original purpose was to protect the West from the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Since the end of the Cold War, many former Soviet nations have joined NATO, much to the annoyance of Putin. What does being a member of NATO mean? Being part of NATO means taking an active role in daily discussions on security and defense matters affecting the alliance. This could range from strategic measures to combat cyberwarfare to moving troops within NATO's borders to protect other members, as has happened during this crisis. Members are supposed to spend 2% of national GDP on defense each year, although few members have done so in recent years. The best-known aspect of the alliance is Article 5 of the treaty, which, if invoked, means ""an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies."" Article 5 has only ever been invoked once, in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. However, the alliance can take collective defense measures without invoking Article 5, and points out that it has done this in the light of the Russian attack on Ukraine. What is a no-fly zone? A no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of a conflict such as the one in Ukraine, it would probably mean a zone in which Russian planes were not allowed to fly, to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes against Ukraine. NATO has imposed no-fly zones in non-member countries before, including Bosnia and Libya. However, it is always a controversial move because it means getting semi-involved in a conflict without fully committing ground forces. What would happen if NATO imposed a no-fly zone? The problem with military no-fly zones is that they have to be enforced by military power. If a Russian aircraft flew into a NATO no-fly zone, then NATO forces would have to take action against that aircraft. Those measures could include shooting the plane from the sky. That would, in Russia's eyes, be an act of war by NATO and would likely escalate the conflict. Why hasn't NATO imposed a no-fly zone? Neither Ukraine nor Russia is a member of NATO. Putin clearly sees NATO as a direct threat to his authority and has recently criticized its expansion toward Russia, using it as justification for his invasion of Ukraine. As a result, NATO is extremely reluctant to become directly involved in the Ukraine conflict with a rival nuclear power. While it supports Ukraine's resistance and recognizes Putin's actions as an invasion of a sovereign nation, the alliance is simply not prepared to do anything that could be interpreted as a direct act of war on Russia and risk an escalation that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. Why does Russia feel threatened by NATO? Putin has long believed that Russia got a bad deal after the breakup of the Soviet Union -- something he has called the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century."" He has complained that NATO has, over time, expanded its borders by admitting Eastern European countries that were once part of the Soviet Union -- meaning Russia now shares a land border with the world's largest military alliance, thus reducing his geopolitical power in what was once Moscow's sphere of influence. As recently as February, he was demanding that NATO scaled back to the borders of 1997, before the Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, the latter two of which border Russia, joined the alliance.",29,2.4062505780810546,6.14707440007709,-3.740823821996035,9

Multiple rockets raining on panicking shoppers outside a supermarket. People walking through a park forced to rush to safety as shells explode around them. These were some of the attacks that residents of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, endured in recent days as Russian forces targeted residential areas, hitting civilian infrastructure such as schools, shops, hospitals, apartment blocks and churches. CNN has geolocated and verified 13 incidents involving civilians over the past three days, as attacks intensified on Kharkiv, a city of about 1.5 million people. following Ukraine's resistance. Most of the attacks took place in the northeastern part of Kharkiv in the residential area of Saltivka. But other districts in the northwest, southeast and southwest of the city were also affected. The city's Freedom Square, the center of public life in Kharkiv, was hit with was believed to be a cruise missile, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister said. In 24 hours, 34 civilians were killed and 285 injured -- including 10 children -- in the Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service said on Thursday morning. As the Kharkiv offensive ramped up, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague announced on Wednesday that he had launched an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referred to Russia's relentless bombardment of Kharkiv, including the deliberate targeting of residential areas with ""jet artillery,"" as a ""war crime"" in a late-night address on Monday. CNN has analyzed and verified digital evidence, including videos and photos, of several indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv. Three schools hit by shelling in one day At least three schools in Kharkiv were hit by Russian military strikes on Tuesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media. In one clip, a school in the northern Saltivka neighborhood is pictured with a gaping hole in the wall, rubble and broken glass strewn across the courtyard. ""School number 17 of Kharkiv city,"" someone can be heard saying in the video. ""It flew right here, everything is in ruins, everything is fallen out, shell fragments everywhere, everything is in smoke."" The other two schools hit in shelling were just over a kilometer (around 0.6 miles) apart, in an industrial district in Kharkiv's southeastern area. Schools have not been in session since the Russian invasion began. Other schools were indirectly affected during the bombing of the center of Kharkiv on Tuesday. Viktor Kruglov, the founder of Ranok, a private school, said they managed to evacuate about 54 orphans from a boarding school for blind and visually impaired children just 15 minutes before the explosion. However, 65 people are still holed up in the basement of the school -- with no electricity or water due to the shelling. They're relying on food and water brought by volunteers, according to Valentyna Butenko, head of the non-governmental organization ""Right to Choose"" (Pravo Vyboru). The school is located 300 meters (approximately 985 feet) from the epicenter of the explosion in Freedom Square. Apartment blocks directly hit On Tuesday, two apartment buildings were directly hit, just outside City Kharkiv municipal hospital No 3. The strikes also hit an office building. In one video, a fire rages at a damaged apartment complex just across the street from the hospital. ""The building is gone,"" someone in the video says. Another video shows children and family fleeing the apartment complex, and at least two bodies on the ground. ""...animals, simply animals,"" someone said, appearing to refer to those responsible for the military strikes. ""People were driving here."" ""A house,"" another person said, adding, ""Look at what they've done."" CNN could not identify any military targets in the area. Other footage from the Saltivka neighborhood, which was shared on local media, showed a row of shops in front of an apartment building destroyed by strikes. A nearby building was also seen on fire. Security camera catches dramatic incident Five residential neighborhoods of Kharkiv were hit on Monday, according to a CNN analysis. What appeared to be surveillance-style footage of an apartment complex on Velyka Kil'tseva Street captured panicked residents rushing for safety as rockets exploded around them. The intense shelling -- at least eight explosions are seen but there are more heard -- lasts for 20 seconds. As the munitions rain down, people are seen running away. One individual is seen falling to the ground as explosions dot the ground around. A parked car explodes after taking a direct hit. After the hail of strikes stop, the individual that fell appears to crawl away, but then stops moving. Their condition is unknown to CNN. Apartment complexes on Klochkivska Street in northwestern Kharkiv, and on Vasylia Stusa Street in eastern Kharkiv were also hit on Monday. Multiple-launch rocket system attack near supermarket The Saltivka neighborhood was also hit by a multiple-launch rocket system, or MLRS, attack on Monday. Videos geolocated by CNN show multiple rockets exploding closely together near the Equator supermarket, while shoppers scramble to safety. One video shows a rocket booster lodged in the street pavement, as some people look at it. According to the Kharkiv City Council, that shelling left one female civilian dead, and 31 wounded. The wounded are made up of 15 servicemen and 16 civilians, says the city council in a press statement. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers. Dan Kaszeta, a defense specialist and an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London, said the images were consistent with a multiple rocket launch system attack. ""The appearance of at least one image of a rocket booster section lends credence to this having been a rocket attack,"" he said. Commenting on that attack, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, said: ""Kharkiv has just been subjected to massive Grad shelling! Dozens of victims."" He described the situation as ""a nightmare.""",17,3.944674764851076,0.9344650779497176,3.010209686901358,29

Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement Thursday: ""I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one."" By comparison, it took three months for one million refugees to leave Syria in 2013 when departures there were at their height, according to the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. Half a million of the refugees are children, according to UNICEF, which warned Europe could be facing its largest refugee crises since World War II. Millions more people are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine, Grandi said. He added: ""International solidarity has been heartwarming. But nothing -- nothing -- can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed. Peace is the only way to halt this tragedy."" In Ukraine's capital Kyiv, residents were awoken in the early hours of Thursday by at least one large explosion in the southwest of the city, following a day of heavy shelling. To the south, the mayor of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea indicated that Russian forces had seized control, though claims remain disputed. And in the port city of Mariupol, home to roughly 400,000, residents are without electricity and water, according to local officials, as Russian troops step up their offensive. A resident of Kherson, which has about 300,000 inhabitants, described the situation there as a ""humanitarian catastrophe,"" telling CNN Thursday there had been chaos and panic in the city as residents tried to get basic necessities. According to the local resident, there is a severe lack of food and medicine -- particularly insulin -- with pharmacies being looted. The resident added that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men. The mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said Wednesday the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control. In Mariupol, the deputy mayor said on Thursday morning that the southeastern Ukrainian city had faced 26 hours of continued shelling and warned it now faces a humanitarian crisis. ""They are destroying our city with all weapons, from artillery, from airplane bombing, from tactical rockets, from multiple launch rocket systems,"" Sergei Orlov told CNN's ""New Day."" ""We do not have electricity in the whole city, we do not have water supplies, we do not have sanitary systems, we do not have heating."" Further north, Ukrainian resistance in the country's second biggest city, Kharkiv, continues to hold out, as Russian strikes hit at least three schools and damaged a cathedral and shops on Wednesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media, geolocated and verified by CNN. In a broadcast message Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed Russian forces, saying: ""You are leaving people without food, you are leaving us without medication. You are shelling evacuation routes, there's no weapon you wouldn't use against us, against free citizens of Ukraine."" Most of those who have fled the country have gone to Poland, to Ukraine's west, with large numbers also entering Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia. Dramatic video filmed Wednesday showed crowds of people on a platform at Kharkiv train station queuing to get on a train to Uzhgorod, in the west, carrying their children and pets as they fled an assault on the city. Worryingly, a ""big number"" of those crossing into Poland are unaccompanied children, according to Poland's Ambassador to the UN Krzysztof Szczerski. Many children crossing the border are leaving behind parents -- particularly their fathers, who have been called by the Ukrainian government to stay behind and fend off Russian troops, he said. Humanitarian corridors On Thursday, a second round of talks between Russia and Ukraine ended with an agreement on humanitarian corridors for civilians, but Ukraine said there were no breakthroughs beyond that. Senior Ukrainian official Mykhailo Podoliak said in a tweet: ""The second round of negotiations is over. Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved. There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors."" The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, outlined some of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion to Russian media. ""We have thoroughly discussed three points -- military, international and humanitarian, and the third one is an issue of a future political regulation of the conflict. Both positions are clear and written down. We managed to agree on some of them, but the key thing that we have reached an agreement on today was a matter of rescuing civilians who found themselves in a military clash zone. Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministries agreed on providing humanitarian corridors for civilians and on a possible temporary ceasefire in areas where evacuation is happening,"" Medinsky told journalists. Another member of the Russian delegation, Leonid Slutsky, told Russia 24 that both sides have agreed on the third round of talks, which will happen in the ""nearest future."" Meanwhile, the Czech government has declared a 30-day state of emergency from Friday in anticipation of a major influx of people fleeing the conflict. The European Union has made the ""historic decision"" to grant temporary protection to all refugees fleeing the conflict, said the bloc's Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, on Thursday. The United Nations World Food Programme has launched an emergency operation to provide food assistance to people within Ukraine and in neighboring countries following an official request from the Ukrainian government. The organization is calling for $570 million to help refugees fleeing violence amid Russia's ongoing invasion. Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement Thursday that, in addition to those who had left the country, one million people were displaced internally. Bachelet said: ""Thousands of people, including older people, pregnant women, as well as children and people with disabilities, are being forced to gather in underground shelters and subway stations to escape explosions. Many people in situations of vulnerability are separated from families and effectively trapped."" With the scale of the humanitarian disaster becoming ever more apparent, the International Criminal Court announced Wednesday it had opened an immediate active investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement Wednesday his office ""had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible."" The move came as the United States and other Western officials warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be shifting his strategy to further target cities and civilian infrastructure with heavy weapons and potentially ""tens of thousands"" of troops. The Russian government has ""strongly"" rejected accusations that it has committed war crimes in Ukraine. It's unclear exactly how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war, but the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission estimates there have been 750 civilian casualties. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers but there are fears of further casualties as Russian strikes hit built-up areas. On Wednesday, the United Kingdom said it was ""gravely concerned"" by ""reports of the use of cluster munitions"" by Russia during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. And earlier that day, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine. ""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs -- which are banned under the Geneva Convention,"" she said. Vacuum bombs, or thermobaric bombs are filled with high-temperature, high-pressure explosives and when detonated suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects. There is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine, though CNN saw Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, on February 26. The Russian advance in the south of Ukraine shows the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east. ""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea. I mean that is an obvious objective,"" NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe Richard Shirreff told CNN. He said he feared the push could cause an increase in civilian deaths as cities become ruins. ""I'm afraid to say I don't think we have seen anything yet in terms of the destruction that's likely to happen,"" Shirreff added.",17,1.4397907069185107,1.244875937400425,0.19491476951808573,1
2022-03-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/what-happens-next-russia-ukraine-cmd-intl/index.html,Russia invaded Ukraine a week ago. What comes next?,"Russia's assault on Ukraine is just a week old, but its consequences have already been catastrophic. In the seven days since Russian troops invaded their western neighbor, hundreds of people have been reported dead and one million have fled for their lives. Energy prices are skyrocketing and food prices could be next. No one can say for sure what will happen in the coming days and weeks, but years of relative peace and stability in Europe have already been ruptured, and should the fighting stretch on for months, the crisis could have even greater ramifications. What happens to Kyiv? Russian President Vladimir Putin has been very clear about his basic goals in invading: He wants to disarm Ukraine, sever its ties to the NATO military alliance and end the Ukrainian people's aspirations of joining the West. He has also said he wants to rid the country of what he calls the ""gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people,"" a baseless and highly-charged reference to Ukraine's democratically-elected government and its Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian forces are encircling the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in an apparent push to topple the government, and a 40-mile-long military convoy is edging toward the city, which has been targeted by multiple rocket and missile attacks in recent days. Zelensky has vowed to keep fighting, but he is under no illusions that Putin's forces ""want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state."" Should those forces take the capital, Ukraine does have other politicians who might be eager to fill the ranks of a pro-Russian puppet regime. One of Putin's top allies in Ukraine is Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent politician and oligarch. He faces allegations of treason in Ukraine and has been under house arrest, but his exact whereabouts are unclear. Territorial goals Russian forces are also waging campaigns far from Kyiv, attempting to take control of key cities in Ukraine's south and southeast, including Kherson. The mayor of Kherson effectively admitted that Ukrainian forces had ceded control of the city on Wednesday, saying in a statement on his Facebook page that residents would have to accept the direction of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- in other words, Russian forces. One former NATO Commander told CNN: ""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea."" Richard Shirreff, NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, said the land corridor was ""an obvious objective."" ""He's had Crimea in the Russian Federation since 2014, he's only been able to supply it across the Kerch Strait bridge, and so of course he's looking to establish that land corridor down off the Sea of Azov,"" Shirreff added. If Russian forces capture the port city of Odessa, it is possible to imagine Moscow creating a land bridge extending all the way across southern Ukraine, potentially even linking Transnistria -- a separatist enclave in Moldova, where Russian troops are stationed -- to Odessa, Crimea and southern and eastern Ukraine. A partitioned Ukraine Parts of modern-day Ukraine previously belonged to interwar Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania -- and before that, to the Austro-Hungarian empire. If Putin has partition in mind, Galician Ukraine and the city of Lviv -- close to the Polish border -- could potentially be a part of a sort of rump Ukrainian state, while Russia focuses its attentions on the east of the country. A division along these lines could make Ukraine ""look like Germany in the Cold War era, with western Ukraine more dependent on Europe, and the Eastern part"" sucked into the Russian spheres of influence, which include Belarus, Russian historian and author Alexander Etkind told CNN. That kind of redrawing of borders may be an expansionist fantasy, but it could separate out what Moscow -- justifiably or not -- perceives as a more nationalist part of Ukraine. Scorched earth battle tactics So far, Ukrainian forces have managed to hold their own against the bigger and much better equipped Russian military. US officials have noted how stretched Russia's supply lines have become even in the early stages of invasion. As one senior US official explained to CNN, Russia anticipated a fast victory and may have neglected to plan for sufficient resupply of its forces. But US administration officials expect Russia to ramp up its operations in Ukraine, and Putin has previously shown scant regard for human rights or the rules of modern warfare. Russia's air force backed President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war, providing overwhelming firepower to crush the country's armed opposition groups and flattening entire neighborhoods in the process. Experts fear the Kremlin could resort to this kind of scorched earth policy in Ukraine, should resistance efforts continue to thwart their plans. Former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus said Monday that the Russian military had already started using such tactics, including cluster bomb munitions. He also said the Kremlin was bringing in thermobaric munitions -- sometimes known as vacuum bombs -- which create a prolonged pressure wave that can suck the oxygen out of a room or a person's lungs. Use of such weaponry in civilian areas is proscribed by international humanitarian law. ""I fear we'll see more of that,"" Petraeus said. ""They will rubble some cities, I suspect, because in some ways they almost have to depopulate areas or they are not secure in them, and we've seen them do that in the past."" The US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Wednesday that Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine: ""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield."" US President Joe Biden said Wednesday he believes Russia is intentionally targeting civilians in Ukraine -- but declined to say whether he believed war crimes were being committed. Sanctions The Kremlin acknowledged Wednesday that Russia's economy is taking ""serious blows,"" as unprecedented sanctions and the country's growing isolation piles pressure on its tottering financial system. International companies have begun shutting down or suspending their Russian operations. Apple, the world's most valuable company, announced Tuesday it had stopped selling all of its products in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine, while Boeing and Airbus are suspending their support for Russian airlines. Russia's energy riches haven't been directly targeted by Western sanctions, but many of the world's biggest oil companies are quitting the country or halting new investments. Moscow is also finding it harder to sell shipments of Russian crude oil to traders and refineries worried about being caught in the net of financial sanctions. But experts say Putin has overseen a push to wean Moscow's oil-dependent economy off the dollar in recent years, and has limited government spending and stockpiled foreign currencies. Putin's economic planners have sought to boost domestic production of certain goods by blocking equivalent products from abroad. Moscow has meanwhile amassed a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves -- a huge sum compared to most other countries -- that can be spent if sanctions bite. It remains to be seen whether such measures will help Russia avoid economic calamity as its invasion continues.",14,1.6360654588729826,3.3097685611539025,-1.67370310228092,16
2022-03-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/ukraine-mariupol-besieged-russia-intl/index.html,Russia squeezes southern Ukraine amid warning 'worst is yet to come',"Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the war in Ukraine is ""going according to plan"" Thursday, with residents of the key city of Mariupol facing a deteriorating humanitarian situation, as the city remains under siege by Russian forces determined to tighten their grip on Ukraine's south. ""The special military operation in Ukraine is going according to plan, in strict accordance with the schedule,"" Putin said in his Security Council broadcast on state television, using the euphemism the Kremlin uses to describe the invasion of Ukraine. ""All tasks are being successfully being carried out."" His remarks came as civilians in Mariupol were trapped without power, heating or water. France also gave a chilling warning that the ""worst is yet to come"" for Ukraine, following talks between Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. Mariupol authorities warned of a ""critical"" situation for residents amid heavy shelling. It's not clear how many of Mariupol's roughly 400,000 inhabitants have been able to evacuate the strategically important port city or how many have been killed or injured. The Russian assault on Mariupol comes as its forces also fight for control of the Black Sea city of Kherson. The mayor of Kherson indicated overnight that Russian forces had seized control of the city of about 300,000, although claims remain disputed. The advance in Ukraine's south shows Russian forces are attempting to create the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa in the west, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east. Mariupol's deputy mayor Sergei Orlov told CNN's ""New Day"" the southeastern city was now ""surrounded"" by Russian forces and was in desperate need of military and humanitarian aid. ""Our Ukrainian army and National Guard is very brave, they stand and fight for Ukraine, for Mariupol. But the situation is quite critical,"" Orlov said Thursday. ""We are asking for help, for military help, and we are waiting for military help,"" Orlov said. ""Our internal forces are very brave, but we are surrounded by the Russian army, which has more people in their army."" Following a 90-minute phone call Thursday between Putin and Macron, an Elysee source told reporters that Putin had said he intended to continue his military operation. ""Without making a prediction, we should expect the worst is yet to come. The (French) President said so yesterday as well. There is nothing in what Putin said today that should reassure us,"" the source said. Putin told Macron he was available for negotiations but emphasized that discussion must take place on the grounds of neutralization and disarmament of Ukraine, the source said. The Russian leader also said that if Kyiv wanted to talk, it must act now -- and if Ukrainians don't accept these conditions, he will obtain the same result by the military path, the source said. Putin denied having bombarded Kyiv and warned that the situation would worsen, but that it was the fault of Ukraine, the source said. France estimates that Russia's military ambition is to take all of Ukraine, the source added. Mayor: Russians creating a 'humanitarian catastrophe' Orlov warned that Mariupol was facing a humanitarian crisis after what he said had been 26 hours of continued shelling. ""They are destroying our city with all weapons, from artillery, from airplane bombing, from tactical rockets, from multiple launch rocket systems,"" Orlov said. ""We do not have electricity in the whole city, we do not have water supplies, we do not have sanitary systems, we do not have heating."" Mariupol's mayor Vadym Boichenko accused the Russian military of creating a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" in the city in a post on his Telegram account Thursday. ""These scum have found no other way to break us. They are blocking the supply and repair of electricity, water and heat. They have also damaged the railways. They have destroyed bridges and smashed trains so that we can't evacuate women, children and the elderly out of Mariupol,"" he said. ""They are blocking food supplies, blocking us like in former Leningrad [during World War II], deliberately destroying the city's critical life-support infrastructure for seven days. Again, we have no light, water or heat."" He said the city was ""working with international institutions to create a 'green corridor' for the humanitarian mission"" and seeking to get a ceasefire so electricity supplies can be restored. Deputy mayor: 'We cannot collect all the bodies' The Russian military announced advances in the Mariupol area Thursday morning. ""The units of the armed forces of the Donetsk People's Republic narrowed the encirclement of the city of Mariupol, and also took control of the settlements of Vinogradnoye, Sartaka and Vodyanoye,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman, said in a video briefing. He repeated claims the military was not targeting civilian areas in Ukraine. A day earlier, Konashenkov outlined an evacuation corridor from Mariupol. ""All civilians wishing to leave Mariupol, for security purposes, can go east along the Mariupol-Shirokino [Shyrokyne] road,"" he said. Russia routinely denies causing civilian casualties in Ukraine. However, CNN and other media and observers have extensively documented civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. Orlov said that Russian shelling had targeted multiple civilian buildings, including homes, kindergartens and schools, but he cautioned that the civilian death toll in the city remains unclear. ""We do not know how many, because we cannot collect all the bodies and we cannot count,"" Orlov said. The situation in Mariupol ""remains difficult,"" a spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Guard told CNN, while stressing that the battle was not over. ""Soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine, together with the Armed Forces, continue to defend the city,"" the spokesperson said. ""The Ukrainian military is not going to surrender the city and will strike at the occupying forces. The military will also continue to destroy enemy sabotage groups on the outskirts of Mariupol."" Mariupol lies just to the west of the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine that has been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Putin recognized the breakaway statelets of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics in the Donbas last month. ""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea. I mean that is an obvious objective,"" NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe Richard Shirreff told CNN. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. Shirreff said he feared the latest push could cause a humanitarian catastrophe as civilian deaths rise and cities become ruins. Kherson: Food, medicines in short supply, looting reported The situation in Kherson, about 260 miles to the west of Mariupol, also appeared to be worsening Thursday. One resident told CNN there had been chaos and panic in Kherson as people tried to get basic necessities. According to the resident, the city is suffering a severe lack of food and medicine -- particularly insulin -- with pharmacies being looted. The resident added that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men. Kherson's mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, called on civilians to stop looting and stealing food supplies Thursday. Kolykhaiev said in a Facebook post the ""city needs food and industrial products"" and called on residents to let the city handle distribution of products. ""We guarantee that it will reach where it is now most expected -- hospitals, orphanages, pensioners, needy, families with many children, social categories, etc,"" he said. On Wedneday, the mayor said on his Facebook page that the Ukrainian military was no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control. Kherson resident Yaroslav Kontsevyi told CNN that Russian occupants have placed checkpoints and sniper points in key places of the city. Kontsevyi said the Russian occupants were stopping civilian Ukrainian men and asking them if they were going to fight on the Russian or Ukrainian side in case of mobilization. Another local resident also noted that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men. A British military intelligence update released early Thursday noted that ""some Russian forces have entered the city of Kherson,"" but cautioned that the military situation on the ground ""remains unclear."" Hennadii Lahuta, head of the Kherson Regional State Administration, said in a statement that Russian forces had ""completely occupied"" the regional state administration building. ""We have not given up our responsibilities. The regional operational headquarters, which I lead, continues its work and addresses issues to help residents of the region. We are waiting for humanitarian aid,"" Lahuta said. A senior US defense official said the United States could not independently verify that the city of Kherson has fallen under Russian control. Mariupol is still under Ukrainian control, according to the US defense official, but Russian forces are advancing on the city from the north and from the coastline with the apparent intention of isolating it. The official added that there had been no ""appreciable"" moves by Russia, naval or otherwise, on the city of Odessa, further to the west.",17,1.3893991234185366,1.5187099800796238,-0.12931085666108721,1
2022-03-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/russian-convoy-stalled-outside-kyiv-intl/index.html,Here's what we know about the 40-mile-long Russian convoy outside Ukraine's capital,"For days, residents of Kyiv had been bracing themselves for a 40-mile-long convoy of Russian tanks, armored vehicles, and towed artillery to arrive for an assault on the Ukrainian capital. Days later, they're still waiting. On Thursday, US intelligence suggested that the convoy was still stalled some distance from Kyiv, backing claims made by both the Ukrainian government and UK's defense ministry. ""We still assess that the convoy that everybody's been focused on is stalled. We have no reason to doubt Ukrainian claims that they have, that they have contributed to it being stalled by attacking it,"" a senior US official told reporters. Earlier in the day, the UK's defense ministry said the convoy appears to have stalled some 30 kilometers (19 miles) outside Kyiv and had made ""little discernible progress"" over the past three days, citing intelligence. ""The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30 km from the center of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days,"" the UK statement said. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday night that while the convoy and Russia's broader push towards Kyiv ""remains stalled,"" there was a significant concern ""that maybe the window is closing to be able to get aid into cities that may become under siege."" A senior US defense official told reporters on that although the convoy is suffering shortages of fuel and food, the US has assessed that the Russians ""will again learn from these missteps and these stumbles and will try to overcome them."" The convoy's stalled progress could create multiple strategic problems for Russia. First, as the key Russian supply line for any major assault on Kyiv, it is a very large sitting target for Ukrainian forces fighting back against the invasion. Second, sitting in a 40-mile-long traffic jam for days at a time could take its toll on the morale and discipline of Russian soldiers ahead of a major military operation. Martti Kari, who previously served as Finland's assistant chief of defense intelligence, told CNN that being stranded like this is bad for morale for two reasons. ""First, the Ukrainians have drones and aircraft that could attack the convoy. Second, when you sit around in the same place rumors circulate that affect your mindset. So you become nervous and tired, which is not a good combination."" The convoy is believed to have entered Ukraine via Belarus, a key ally of Putin where Russia had moved huge numbers of troops in recent weeks to carry out what they called joint exercises. When the exercises ended, the troops didn't leave and satellite images actually showed that Russia increased their military presence in the country. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Wednesday night that the fierce Ukrainian resistance had dented Russian morale. ""More and more occupiers are fleeing back to Russia, from us, from you ... we are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week — plans those have been built for years,"" he said in a Facebook post. The latest assessments on the convoy comes after the Russian military issued its first casualty figures from the war, saying 498 of its troops had died and another 1,597 had been injured. The UK statement on Thursday said ""the actual number of those killed and wounded will almost certainly be considerably higher and continue to rise."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed ""great sorrow"" over Russian military casualties on Thursday morning. But Russia appeared to be meeting less resistance in southern Ukraine, where the mayor of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea indicated that Russian forces had seized control, though claims remain disputed. And the crucial southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol came under siege from Russian forces Thursday, as Moscow seeks to tighten its grip on the south of the country.",14,1.5116294948718774,2.074232566988337,-0.5626030721164597,29
2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/politics/us-russia-ukraine-civilians-warning/index.html,US officials warn Russia will increasingly hit civilian targets and seek 'slow annihilation' of Ukraine's military,"Russia's strategy in its war on Ukraine is shifting toward a ""slow annihilation"" of the Ukrainian military, US and other Western officials tell CNN, warning that Russia could focus on a bloody and deadly bombardment of cities and civilian targets as the conflict becomes a grinding war of attrition. Ukrainian forces have so far been able to stave off Russia's initial push, maintaining control of Kyiv and other major cities. But they remain massively outgunned and outmanned. And Russia is now bringing in heavier, more destructive weaponry and increasingly striking civilian infrastructure, after an initial focus on military targets, the officials said. The shift in strategy likely reflects a recognition by Russian President Vladimir Putin that his initial plan to quickly topple Kyiv has failed, said one senior Western intelligence official -- in part because the Ukrainians have put up a stiffer than anticipated fight and in part because logistics and supply missteps have slowed the Russian advance. But Western officials now expect that Russia will ramp up heavy weapons bombardment of Ukraine's cities and potentially march in ""tens of thousands"" of troops, one US official said. Eventually, officials caution, Ukraine's military will likely run short of supplies needed to keep up the fight. The US has delivered hundreds of Stinger missiles to Ukraine over the last few days, including more than 200 on Monday, according to a US official and a congressional source briefed on the matter. But the US and NATO have made it clear they will not commit troops to defending Ukraine. 'Cruel military math' Ukraine's will to fight ""is extending this,"" said the senior Western intelligence official. ""But the cruel military math of this will eventually come to bear, absent some intervention, absent some fundamental change in the dynamic."" For Ukraine, whose military forces and civilian population have shown no signs of capitulating, the war appears poised to become a grim struggle for survival over a protracted, uncertain future. The numbers are already bleak: Russia has lost roughly 3% to 5% of its tanks, aircraft, artillery and other military assets inside Ukraine — compared with Ukrainian losses of roughly 10% of its capabilities, according to two US officials familiar with the latest intelligence. Moscow has leaned heavily on its more modern precision cruise missiles, according to a source familiar with the intelligence, heavily degrading Ukraine's military infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ukraine has continued to burn through its supply of shoulder-fired Javelin missiles. Western security assistance has flowed across the border into Ukraine in recent days, defense and intelligence officials say, although they have declined to provide details on how much, precisely what kind or how it is getting to the embattled Ukrainian forces. Public statements from Ukrainian officials suggest it's not enough. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a call Wednesday that Ukraine needs additional deliveries of weapons ""now,"" Kuleba tweeted. ""They need bullets. They need bandages. They're going to need fuel. They're going to need ammunition, in addition to the humanitarian support to help with medical assistance, sustaining hospitals, both for combat wounded and for civilians that are being hurt,"" the senior intelligence official said of Ukrainian supplies. ""And they're going to need a lot again in ammunition and the weapons resupply, because the Russian force is both numerically and qualitatively superior,"" this person said. Fears of civilian casualties In addition to grinding down Ukraine's military, US and other Western officials fear Russia's siege tactics will cause heavy civilian casualties as Moscow aims to ultimately take Ukraine's capital of Kyiv. While the first few nights of Russia's campaign were aimed at military sites, during the last three there have been missile, artillery and rocket attacks against many civilian areas, where there may be administrative buildings but no security installations. CNN has been able to confirm attacks in Irpin, near Kyiv, as well as Mariupol, Borodjanka, Kharkiv and Kherson. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of bringing weapons banned under the Geneva Conventions into Ukraine on Wednesday. ""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs -- which are banned under the Geneva Convention,"" she said. A senior defense official said Tuesday that the US could not prove that cluster munitions or vacuum bombs had been used by the Russian military. ""We're likely to see an expansion of what we've seen in the last 48 hours, which is already a great degree of civilian infrastructure damage -- whether intentional or unintentional,"" said the senior intelligence official. ""The violence level will go up. The numbers of refugees will go up. The numbers of civilian casualties and civilian dead will go up."" Russians turning to heavier forces To be sure, the Russian military's offensive has faced numerous problems -- some of its own making, officials say. A 40-mile-long convoy of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery positioned north of Kyiv is ""stalled,"" the senior defense official said Wednesday. The official said the US assesses there are multiple factors that appear to have slowed Russia's move on Kyiv, including fuel and food problems, an effective, ""stiff resistance"" from Ukrainians and potential morale problems within Russia's ranks. But the official cautioned that the Russians would learn from their mistakes and adapt. The Western intelligence official said that a week into the war, the Russian military appears to have realized its initial approach to Ukraine was problematic, which relied on the use of lighter units that were more mobile but less able to support themselves. ""I think part of what you're seeing is them now catching up, seeing now it's time to introduce heavier troops,"" the official said. ""I think the concern we have is that they seem to be now bringing in heavier forces, with more armor, more long-range artillery, heavier weapons, that are not just more destructive in their nature but, frankly, are also less precise."" Social media posts and open-source intelligence, as well as videos and other information released by Ukraine, have suggested that many Russian troops were unprepared for or even uninformed of the true nature of the mission they were being sent to accomplish. Based on that open-source reporting, Western officials believe that troop morale, at least among some ground units, is very low, officials told CNN. That could also slow Russian progress, officials said. Perhaps equally significant are Ukrainian efforts to publicize Russian casualties and allow captured Russian soldiers to call their loved ones at home -- efforts that could inform the Russian population of the war being waged in their name abroad. ""They [Russia] have to prevent knowledge of Russian combat losses in their own domestic audience in a way they have in every other conflict that they had not supposedly participated in,"" the Western intelligence official said. ""And they'll go to great lengths domestically to prevent that word from getting out."" Estimates of Russian casualties vary; Ukraine on Wednesday said 6,000 Russians have been killed or wounded, while US sources familiar with the intelligence say the assessment is closer to 2,000 or 3,000.",14,1.66334820340212,1.828133720152813,-0.16478551675069286,12
2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/europe/russia-ukraine-shifting-map-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html,The shifting map of Ukraine makes Russia's intentions clearer,"Switch on Russian state television, and the spectacle of war in Ukraine is rather bloodless. News broadcasts feature Russian troops on the move in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, Russian military helicopters skimming above tree level, and sorry-looking Ukrainians laying down arms and signing promises not to fight. Russia's First Channel on Wednesday also featured commentators gathered around a slick interactive map that purported to show advances by Russian troops and the Russian-backed separatist forces of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. What Russians were not seeing, however, were images of Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv and Kyiv in the aftermath of heavy shelling or missile strikes. No, the picture on Russian television is largely sterile, with slick handout video from the Ministry of Defense and stiff official briefings by Russia's main military spokesperson, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov. There is scant mention of casualties -- either Russian military or Ukrainian civilian -- and the language is euphemistic. Russia, after all, is carrying out what's called a ""special military operation,"" and domestic news outlets are forbidden from calling it a war or an invasion. But a picture of Russia's military intentions is becoming clearer. Around Kyiv, its forces are focusing on encircling the Ukrainian capital, in an apparent push to topple the government -- a goal President Vladimir Putin, in false and brazen terms, calls ""denazification."" And a sort of crescent of Russian-held territory is emerging in the country's east and south. On Wednesday morning, Russia claimed its troops had taken full control of the southern city of Kherson, to the north of the Crimean peninsula -- something Ukraine's defense ministry disputed. But the push north from Crimea has expanded a zone of Russian control that was established in 2014, when Russia occupied and annexed the Black Sea peninsula. It has also restored water supplies to Crimea, as Russian forces have reopened a canal that supplied up to 85% of the peninsula's needs before being cut off in the wake of the annexation. More importantly, the advance in the area shows the beginning of a potential land bridge that -- in theory -- could link the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, through Kherson, to the separatist-held territories in the east. A key part of that possible corridor is the southeastern city of Mariupol. Heavy fighting continues there, with Russian and Russian-backed separatist forces encircling the city of some 400,000 people on three sides. Vadym Boychenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said Wednesday that the number of wounded civilians was ""growing every day."" North of Mariupol, and near the Russian border, the city of Kharkiv has come under heavy Russian fire. On Wednesday, there was a military strike in the vicinity of Kharkiv's City Council, one day after the Kharkiv Regional State Administration building was hit by a strike that, according to Ukrainian officials, killed 10 people and injured at least 24. No images of this fighting are reaching viewers of state television in Russia -- although many Russians have access to the internet, and some can watch international networks. But the messaging by Russian officials and state media is eerily reminiscent of the war in Syria. The Kremlin has warned that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" are planning to use civilians as ""human shields,"" while the Russian military offers the promise of safe routes out of the city. On the morning that Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, Konashenkov, the Russian military spokesperson, claimed -- without evidence -- that the Security Service of Ukraine was preparing to circulate fake news about civilian casualties. ""In Ukrainian cities, staged video filming was carried out with alleged 'mass casualties' among the civilian population of Ukraine,"" Konashenkov claimed, according to Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti. Such wild and unfounded claims follow Russia's playbook of maligning Syria's White Helmets, a volunteer rescue group that has provided the world with some of the most compelling proof of the targeting of civilians by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian airpower. Russia insists it is not targeting residential neighborhoods in Ukraine, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. But the deliberate repetition of that propaganda is a chilling reminder that the default Russian strategy when it comes to evidence of civilian casualties is outright denial.",17,2.164797310890764,6.181482714085905,-4.016685403195141,29
2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/politics/senate-passes-major-cybersecurity-legislation/index.html,Senate passes major cybersecurity legislation to force reporting of cyberattacks and ransomware,"The Senate on Tuesday passed major cybersecurity legation, moving one step closer toward forcing critical infrastructure companies to report cyberattacks and ransomware payments. The passage comes as federal officials have repeatedly warned of the potential for Russian cyberattacks against the United States amid the escalating conflict in Ukraine. The legislation, which still has to pass in the House, would require critical infrastructure owners and civilian federal agencies to report to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within 72 hours if they experience a substantial cyberattack. It would also require critical infrastructure companies to report ransomware payments to the federal government within 24 hours. ""As our nation continues to support Ukraine, we must ready ourselves for retaliatory cyber-attacks from the Russian government,"" Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, who was the lead author on the package of bills, said in a statement, noting that online attacks have the potential to disrupt the economy, drive up gasoline prices and threaten supply chains. The reporting requirements were introduced in the Senate after several high-profile cybersecurity and ransomware incidents put pressure on lawmakers to better protect critical infrastructure and discourage attacks. Last May, a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline prompted the company to shut down thousands of miles of pipeline and led to increased prices and gas shortages. That incident, was followed several weeks later by a cyberattack on a major US meat producer, highlighting the impact ransomware can have on vital services in the US. Peters said that the ""landmark, bipartisan bill"" would ensure that CISA is the lead agency helping critical infrastructure operators and the government respond to hacks. The Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act, which combines language from three bills, would also require the government to take a risk-based approach to cybersecurity and would also authorize the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) to ensure federal agencies can adopt cloud-based technologies. ""This is a very substantial piece of cyber legislation,"" Padraic O'Reilly, co-founder of cyber risk firm, CyberSaint, told CNN. O'Reilly said the current geopolitical landscape has made the legislation ""significantly less controversial"" as the US braces for a potential cyberattack from Russian actors. The ""risk-based"" cybersecurity requirements for the federal government ""jumped out,"" he said of the legislation. This type of cybersecurity takes into account the likelihood of something bad happening, its impact and deciding how best to spend money to make it better. The legislation would require federal agencies to use this approach, which would likely spill over into the private sector, said O'Reilly. ""To see that risk-based approach written into law ... is really quite powerful,"" he said. The 72-hour reporting deadline raised concern for some companies, according to Danielle Jablanski, an operational technology cybersecurity strategist at Nozomi Networks, who noted that information sharing may not be the top priority in a crisis. The focus instead might be on safety and critical operations, she said. ""The deadline is difficult, because there's so many priorities at stake,"" Jablanski said, adding that the legislation doesn't holistically help critical infrastructure owners and operators prioritize everything that's at stake during an attack. However, she said the government is in the best position to encourage information sharing that can benefit multiple companies and industries. Several members of the US House of Representatives, including Democrat Yvette Clarke and Republican John Katko, both of New York, are working with Peters and GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio to pass the bill in the House. Portman also said he is concerned about retaliatory cyber and ransomware attacks from Russia as the US ""rightly"" supports Ukraine. ""The federal government must quickly coordinate its response to potential attacks and hold these bad actors accountable,"" he said in a statement. During her first congressional hearing after taking office, CISA Director Jen Easterly called for cyber incident reporting to help victims of hacks, as well as to analyze the information and share it more broadly to see if similar intrusions are found elsewhere. ""We absolutely agree it's long past time to get cyber incident reporting legislation out there, and we're excited to work with you on this,"" Easterly told Peters in September. This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.",3,6.729377071418039,0.40551232010620686,6.323864751311832,23
2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/politics/blinken-russia-cyberattacks-ukraine/index.html,Biden administration remains 'on guard' for Russian cyberattacks amid war in Ukraine,"The Biden administration continues to be on alert for potential Russian criminal or state-backed cyberattacks against critical infrastructure targets in the US -- a posture that Washington assumed months ago but that has grown more acute since Russia invaded Ukraine. The US is ""very much on guard"" for potential Russian cyberattacks in light of the war, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday, adding that the Biden administration had been working to harden the defenses of US organizations and those in Ukraine. Blinken was referring to months of quiet preparation for Russian hacking capabilities -- through classified briefings and closed-door exercises -- that have gone on between the Biden administration and US critical infrastructure firms. US officials continue to say there are ""no specific, credible"" threats to the US homeland tied to tensions with Russia over Ukraine. But they want US businesses to be mindful that ransomware gangs -- or Russian state-backed hackers -- could get more aggressive as US relations with Russia hit their lowest point since the Cold War. ""We remain concerned that Russian cybercriminals will target US critical infrastructure with ransomware attacks either in support of the Russian government or to take advantage of the even more permissive operating environment inside Russia,"" senior FBI cyber official Cynthia Kaiser told state and local government officials during a call on Tuesday, sources on the call told CNN. The phone briefing was just the latest in a regular series of calls that the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have held for local government agencies and private firms to remind them to stay vigilant for digital threats. Kaiser cited a declaration of support for the Kremlin that a prominent Russian-speaking ransomware gang made on Friday amid the war in Ukraine. The hackers later amended their statement, claiming they don't support any government, but their threat to retaliate against US infrastructure has resonated with US officials. Regardless of whether Russia-aligned hackers do anything impactful, US officials hope that the extra drilling and risk assessments can make US critical infrastructure firms more secure in the medium term. And it builds on years of work the electric sector and other critical industries have done to become more resilient to physical and hacking threats. ""If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,"" US President Joe Biden said last Thursday in denouncing Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Within hours of Biden's speech, the Transportation Security Administration held an exercise with hundreds of US pipeline companies, testing how they would respond to ""a scenario of escalating cyber threats as a result of geopolitical tensions,"" Jake Rubin, a spokesperson for the American Gas Association, a trade group that helped draw up the exercise, told CNN. Before the Ukraine crisis, the White House had encouraged US electric utilities serving tens of millions of customers to adopt more cyber defensive tools -- the first in a series of ""100-day plans"" to try to improve cybersecurity in key sectors. That work came about, in part, because US officials weren't seeing enough investment in threat-detection capabilities for industrial control systems, which firms use to deliver key commodities like fuel, Mark Bristow, a CISA official, said on a February 14 webinar. Simply trading data on threats -- rather than having a fuller picture of what hacking groups are trying to do -- ""isn't going to help"" in scenarios when ""adversaries are using their A game,"" Bristow said. Now, the National Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are drawing on intelligence from those sensors to track hacking threats. The idea is that the NSA can pass along intelligence indicating that, for example, a foreign hacking group is probing for vulnerabilities in electric equipment, said Robert M. Lee, CEO of cybersecurity firm Dragos, whose technology has been adopted by some of the utilities. A reminder of the potential threat came in December, as Russia continued to mass troops along Ukraine's border in the lead up to the invasion. That month, a hacking group that caused a Saudi petrochemical plant to shut down in 2017, had probed the computer networks of US electric utilities that operate liquified natural gas facilities, cybersecurity researchers previously told CNN. The Treasury Department in 2020 sanctioned a Russian government institute for its alleged involvement in the 2017 incident. The probing of US utilities in December did not lead to any compromises, but it underscored what's at stake in the fight to secure American infrastructure -- and the progress operators are making in having better visibility of those threats. ""It's a bit of a cat and mouse team because we constantly need to evolve those things to keep up with the latest techniques that the adversaries are using,"" said Manny Cancel, who heads the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a threat-sharing hub for North American utilities.",3,0.6790519468000242,7.419755641343138,-6.740703694543114,23
2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html,Brutal onslaught rages in Ukraine as Russia expands assaults on key cities,"Fierce fighting for control of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson left dozens dead as Russia's onslaught against multiple Ukrainian cities intensified Wednesday and fears over the civilian toll mounted. More than 800,000 civilians have fled since the invasion began a week ago, with fears of further casualties increasing as Russian strikes hit built-up areas. Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported ""massive shelling and bombing"" of the central part of Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, on Wednesday morning. In other developments: Sounds of air raid sirens and a new explosion in Kyiv as night falls. Fighting continues in the southern city of Mariupol, with residents reporting heavy shelling overnight. Russian forces moving towards Kyiv, including a large Russian military convoy, ""remain stalled,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday. Western sanctions are dealing ""serious blows"" to Russia's economy, the Kremlin said. On Wednesday night, CNN teams on the ground heard air raid sirens in Ukraine's third-largest city Odessa and the town of Uman, Ukraine. Meanwhile, in the capital of Kyiv, a major heating pipeline was damaged as a result of a missile strike to the area of the Central Railway station in the evening, the country's interior ministry said. The sound of the blast could be heard across the city, according to a CNN team, though the target of the strike was not clear. Kyiv's mayor Vitaly Klitschko said preliminary reports suggested there were no casualties in a blast, adding: ""We are clarifying the details."" Klitschko said in a Telegram post that despite shelling in a number of Kyiv suburbs Wednesday, ""Thank God, there are no casualties."" ""The enemy was trying to breakthrough to our city, but Ukrainian defenders are repulsing the occupiers and defending our capital."" It's unclear what caused the blast near the station. An Interior Ministry adviser said the damage was caused by the falling wreckage of a cruise missile after it had been intercepted by Ukrainian air defense systems. Kherson mayor indicates city has fallen The mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said that the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control. The announcement on the mayor's Facebook page late Wednesday follows several days of pressure on Kherson by Russian forces who had surrounded the city. Kherson City Council said earlier in the day that least 36 people had been killed in an ongoing battle for control of the area. Kherson is a strategically important city on an inlet from the Black Sea with a population of nearly 300,000. If Kherson is now under Russian control, it would be a significant turning point for the invading military -- the first major city seized. Earlier Wednesday, Ukraine disputed Russian claims of control saying Ukrainians forces were still fighting in parts of the city. The new post said Ukrainian forces had left. The mayor also told the New York Times in an interview that a group of about 10 armed Russian officers, including the commander of forces attacking the city, entered the city hall building Wednesday. He said he was informed by the Russian officers that they were planning to set up a new administration similar to those in two Russian-backed separatist statelets in eastern Ukraine, according to the NY Times interview. Late Wednesday, Hennady Lahuta, the head of Kherson regional administration, issued a message saying: ""I ask everyone who is not at home now, or who is planning to go outside, not to do so. The occupiers are in all areas of the city and are very dangerous."" Mayor Kolykhaiev did not explicitly say that the Russians controlled the city, but that ""there were armed visitors in the city executive committee today."" Strikes in Kharkiv In Kharkiv, a Wednesday morning strike on the regional police department and Kharkiv National University left the buildings engulfed by fire, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service and videos geolocated by CNN. Four people were killed and nine injured, the State Emergency Service said Wednesday, while rescuers pulled 10 people from the rubble. New videos posted to social media early Wednesday and verified by CNN showed badly damaged buildings in western Kharkiv in an area with markets, stores and residential buildings. In Kharkiv's northern neighborhood of Saltivka, a school was the latest site of Russian military strikes on Wednesday, according to a video and photo posted to social media. CNN geolocated and confirmed the authenticity of the video and photo. The school has been the site of repeated strikes in recent days. Video from the scene shows a large hole in the wall of a school, rubble strewn across a courtyard and broken glass. ""School number 17 of Kharkiv city,"" a voice says in the video. ""It flew right here, everything is in ruins, everything is fallen out, shell fragments everywhere, everything is in smoke."" Fighting took place overnight between Russian and Ukrainian forces near a Kharkiv military hospital, the head of the local police told Ukraine's public broadcaster, Suspilne News. It's unclear how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war. The UN on Tuesday reported at least 136 civilian deaths since Russia's invasion started, but cautioned the toll is likely ""much higher."" CNN could not independently verify this figure. Earlier today, Ukraine's State Emergency Service issued a statement claiming more than 2,000 civilians had been killed, before removing it. The Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure. While the US and NATO allies have aided Ukraine by sharing arms, military equipment and intelligence, as well as imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia, the alliance has thus far made clear it has no plans to send soldiers into Ukrainian territory. Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, has mounted a fierce resistance, but in a rare interview from a Kyiv bunker Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that his country -- which has a much smaller military than Russia -- needs more help to prevent the crisis from spreading across Europe. ""I've spoken to Biden many times,"" Zelensky told CNN. ""And I've told them many times that Ukraine will resist and fight stronger than anyone else but on our own against Russia we won't manage it."" Onslaught in Ukraine As Russia continued to strike key cities on Wednesday, the humanitarian cost of the invasion is steadily increasing. The International Criminal Court said on Wednesday that it has opened an investigation into alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine. ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement that 39 of the court's member states had requested for the investigation to proceed. ""Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced,"" Khan said, noting the investigation will cover incidents in Ukraine from 2013 to the present. Khan said his office ""had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible."" Meanwhile, the number of people fleeing the country continues to rise. The UN said Wednesday it had recorded the arrival of 835,928 refugees from Ukraine since the invasion began on February 24. Of those, more than 450,000 have entered Poland. ""We are looking at what could become Europe's largest refugee crisis this century,"" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said a day earlier. The UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update Wednesday that Russia's overall gains had been limited in the past 24 hours, adding this was probably due to ""ongoing logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance."" Russia has continued to target built-up areas with air strikes and heavy artillery, it added, focusing mainly on Kharkiv, Kyiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv. Russian forces moving towards Kyiv in the northern part of Ukraine, including a 40-mile Russian convoy of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery, ""remain stalled,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said during a Wednesday briefing. ""They haven't from our best estimates made any appreciable progress in the last 24-36 hours,"" Kirby said of the Russian forces moving towards Kyiv. ""Nothing very significant."" Kirby said the stall is likely due to a number of factors including Russian forces deliberately ""regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up the lost time,"" ""logistics and sustainment challenges,"" and ""resistance from the Ukrainians,"" Kirby said. In Kyiv, sick children are being treated in a hospital's underground bomb shelters. A missile hit a private maternity clinic near the capital on Tuesday, leaving the clinic damaged but still standing, according to the clinic's chief. Separately, a military strike tore through two apartment blocks in a town west of Kyiv. Russian forces also fired rockets that hit near a TV tower. In a statement Wednesday, Russia's defense ministry acknowledged carrying out long-range strikes on communications infrastructure in Ukraine. Russian and Ukrainian delegations were set to meet later Wednesday for a new round of talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a call with foreign journalists. He gave no details about the location or format of the discussions. Peskov also acknowledged in the call that the Russian economy was taking ""serious blows"" as a result of sanctions imposed by the West, but said there was a ""certain margin of safety"" and that the economy ""will stay on its feet."" A Ukrainian presidential aide told CNN the two delegations were expected to comprise the same representatives as in the first round of talks on Monday, held in Belarus near the Ukrainian border. The two sides discussed a potential ceasefire, according to a Ukrainian presidential adviser, but no concrete result emerged. In a Facebook post published Wednesday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia's claims were unchanged during Monday's talks. ""We are ready for talks, we are ready for diplomacy, but we are not in any way ready to accept any Russian ultimatums,"" he added. Meanwhile, the international community is stepping up pressure on Putin, leaving Russia increasingly isolated. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday that the UK would ""continue to tighten the noose around Putin's regime,"" adding that its use of munitions in civilian areas ""in my view already fully qualifies as a war crime."" French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe has been ""shaken"" by the war in Ukraine in an address to the nation on Wednesday.

2022-03-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/europe/russia-military-challenges-ukraine-past-wars-intl-hnk/index.html,"If the past is anything to go by, Russia will struggle to occupy Ukraine","Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion has shown strength that has surprised many observers, but one expert has warned historical precedent bodes poorly for Moscow's forces in the long term should it be unable to subdue the country quickly. ""The Russian army is overextended and in a precarious position if Ukraine becomes a protracted war,"" Seth Jones, vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based think tank, said in a social media post. ""Assuming 150,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine and a population of 44 million, that is a force ratio of 3.4 soldiers per 1,000 people. You can't hold territory with those numbers,"" Jones said. He compared that Russian force ratio to occupations after previous wars around the world, saying successful ones had force ratios that were ""astronomically higher."" For example, he said, the Allied forces occupying Germany in 1945 had 89.3 troops to 1,000 inhabitants; NATO forces in Bosnia in 1995, 17.5 troops to 1,000 inhabitants; NATO forces in Kosovo in 2000, 19.3 to 1,000, and international forces in East Timor in 2000, 9.8 to 1,000. Writing in the 2003 review of the RAND Corp. think tank, analyst and mathematician James Quinlivan said a benchmark force ratio for a successful occupation is about 20 to 1,000. US and coalition force ratios in Afghanistan in 2002 and Iraq in 2003 were only 0.5 to 1,000 and 6.1 to 1,000 respectively, according to statistics cited by Quinlivan. ""High numbers of troops and police are critical to establish basic law and order,"" Jones said. ""In fact, the number of Russian soldiers in Ukraine aren't even enough to hold any major cities for long."" And if Russian occupiers face a guerrilla war in the event the Ukrainian government falls, odds won't be in their favor, he said. ""They will be in serious danger of being picked apart by Ukrainian insurgents."" Soviet forces waged a lengthy campaign against Ukrainian insurgents after the end of World War II. Partisan warfare continued through the late 1940s in parts of western Ukraine, but the Soviets crushed most armed resistance by the early 1950s. US officials have also noted how stretched Russia's supply lines have become even in the early stages of invasion. As one senior US official explained to CNN, Russia anticipated a fast victory and may have neglected to plan for sufficient resupply of its forces. Supply lines, this official explained, are a ""definite vulnerability."" But US administration officials said Monday that Russia was expected to ramp up its operations in Ukraine. The officials warned lawmakers in classified briefings that a second wave of Russian troops will likely consolidate the country's positions within Ukraine, and could by sheer numbers be able to overcome the Ukrainian resistance, according to two people familiar with the briefings. ""That part was disheartening,"" one lawmaker told CNN. Still, a map of current Russian positions shows Moscow's forces have gained control of only a small portion of Ukraine -- a vast country just slightly smaller than the US state of Texas. And again, looking at past conflicts, Russia faces formidable challenges in taking Ukraine's urban areas, like the capital, Kyiv. ""Urban terrain offers incredible resources and advantages for a defending force to cause disproportionate numbers of causalities on an attacking element, cause the attacker to run out of time in the strategic environment, and ultimately bring the momentum of an attack to a screeching halt,"" John Spencer and Jayson Geroux wrote this month for the Modern War Institute at West Point, home of the US Military Academy. The pair, former US and Canadian military officers respectively, pointed to conflicts from World War II to the Korean War to Chechnya to Syria, where urban defenders were able to inflict high losses on their attackers. With a 40-mile (64-kilometer) column of Russian military vehicles and armor lined up in the direction of Kyiv, what Spencer and Geroux point out happened to Russian armor in Grozny, in Chechnya, in 1995, might be especially ominous for Moscow's current forces. Chechen separatists, operating in teams with as few as two men, and using only rifles, grenades and grenade launchers, set on Russian armored vehicles from basements and the upper floors of buildings, they wrote. ""Main tanks and other weapons could not effectively return fire,"" Spencer and Geroux said. ""Once in their trap, ambush teams would strike the vulnerable points of Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers, hit the lead and trail vehicles, quickly withdraw, and then move up the flanks to strike the now paralyzed Russian columns again,"" they said. Over three days in January 1995, one Russian brigade lost 102 of its 120 armored vehicles and 20 of 26 tanks to the Chechen separatists in Grozny, they said. If this example even holds partially true for what the Russian invaders will face in Ukraine's cities, the war will not be coming to any quick end.",14,3.0864068696571803,4.609804672391483,-1.5233978027343031,21

The rocket attack took out broadcasting hardware, raising fears that Moscow is attempting to knock out the city's communications infrastructure. Ahead of the strikes, Russia's military urged nearby residents to flee. The attack, along with a beef-up of assaults on other key cities, brings the Russian invasion right into the heart of the nation. Another rocket hit a private maternity clinic near the capital Kyiv on Tuesday, leaving the clinic damaged but still standing, according to the Adonis maternity clinic chief Vitaliy Gyrin's Facebook post. Separately, a military strike tore through two apartment blocks in a town west of Kyiv. As the rockets hit Kyiv on Tuesday, a 40-mile Russian convoy of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery was headed toward the Ukrainian capital, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies. However, a US official said the convoy has been stalled due to fuel supply issues. The Russian advance on Kyiv remains ""basically... where it was yesterday"" according to a senior defense official, who also said there were signs that they were running out of food. While Ukraine mounts a defense against the Russian onslaught, some 677,000 people have fled the country in ""less than a week,"" with 150,000 fleeing in the last 24 hours alone, according to the United Nations. The UN has also raised concerns for the millions of people still in the country, with UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths saying this is the ""darkest hour"" for the people of Ukraine. ""Families with small children are hunkered down in basements and subway stations or running for their lives to the terrifying sound of explosions and wailing sirens,"" he said in a statement. In his State of the Union speech Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said President Vladimir Putin ""badly miscalculated"" when he invaded Ukraine and announced a ban on Russian aircraft from US airspace which he said would further isolate Russia and squeeze its economy. He reiterated that US forces would not deploy to the Ukraine -- instead, they were deployed to Europe to defend America's NATO allies ""in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west."" In an exclusive interview with CNN and Reuters from a bunker ahead of the speech, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated calls for the US and NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine or put boots on the ground, saying ""I do believe that leaders do have to support democratic countries and they have to help them."" Asked if he felt Ukraine was wasting its time by talking with Russia, he said: ""We'll see."" On Monday, Ukrainian and Russian officials met for the first time since Moscow began their assault last week. Biden and Zelensky held a 30-minute phone conversation on Tuesday. Biden, the White House said, ""underscored the United States' sustained help for Ukraine, including ongoing deliveries of security assistance, economic support, and humanitarian aid.""

In videos and social media posts shared soon after the strike, plumes of smoke were seen swirling around the red-and-white steel TV tower building, which is located near the city's Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center (BYHMC). In a statement, BYHMC said the remembrance site was struck by Russian forces. ""Putin seeks to distort and manipulate the Holocaust to justify an illegal invasion of a sovereign democratic country is utterly abhorrent,"" said BYHMC Advisory Board Chair Natan Sharanksy, adding that it is ""symbolic"" that the attack happened where an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 people were shot by the Nazis. Russian forces also attacked key cities in Ukraine from several sides, scaling up its bombardment of Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, in the northeast and breaking through a heavily contested port city in the south. Russia's actions on Tuesday mark a far less restrained bombing campaign, raising concerns that more civilians could be hit in strikes. The UN says that at least 102 civilians have been killed across the country and 304 injured, though those figures are likely to underestimate the true toll. US officials also warned that the sheer breadth of Russian firepower could overwhelm Ukrainian resistance. Russia's military is far bigger and more powerful than Ukraine's by just about every measure, but Ukraine's allies, including the European Union, are scrambling to send more weapons into the country to aid its defense. On Tuesday, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned that ""the enemy is on the outskirts of the capital,"" but the Ukrainian military is ""preparing to defend Kyiv."" ""Fortifications and checkpoints have been built at the entrances to the city. I ask everyone to keep calm. Do not go outside unnecessarily and stay in shelters in case of alarm,"" he said in a video message. In an interview with CNN Tuesday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told CNN that Russia ""dominates in the sky"" while Ukrainian forces have sought to destroy ground forces headed towards Ukrainian cities. ""Our pilots are fighting fiercely against them, but we also have losses,"" Kuleba said. ""So the Russians use their fighting jets and bombers to attack our cities and we need to counter this threat."" He added, ""This are the two most urgent requests that we lodged with our partners."" Zelensky's plea President Zelensky made an impassioned plea to the European leaders earlier Tuesday to grant Ukraine immediate membership to the EU, saying his country was fighting for survival. Zelensky's plea came as Russia accelerated strikes on Kharkiv, which was rocked by a large explosion that incinerated cars, blew out windows and destroyed a large government building in the main Freedom Square. Emergency services said at least 10 people were killed and 24 injured in the strike, which Zelensky described as an ""act of terror"" on civilians in a Facebook post. Late Monday, at least five separate residential areas in Kharkiv were hit by rockets, according to CNN analysis of social media videos. During a trip to Poland on Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the Russian invasion ""worse than our predictions,"" pointing to attacks like those seen in Kharkiv's neighborhoods. ""It is clear that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use barbaric and indiscriminate tactics against innocent civilians to bomb tower blocks, to send missiles into tower blocks, to kill children, as we're seeing in increasing numbers,"" he said. A Kharkiv resident named Tetyana, 66, told CNN that a shell hit her house early Tuesday morning, shattering its windows. Tetyana -- who sleeps in her shoes and coat since the invasion began -- ran to her basement where her relative Oleg told her that his car had burned down and ""the school in the yard was totally destroyed."" The day before, CNN confirmed five residential areas in the city had been hit by military strikes on Monday using videos shared on social media. Dramatic video, taken by a surveillance-type camera at an apartment complex on Velyka Kil'tseva St, shows repeated explosions from one strike that landed in a parking lot and walkway. The intense shelling -- at least eight explosions are seen but there are more heard -- lasts for 20 seconds. As the munitions rain down, people are seen running as the explosions dot the ground: one individual falls to the ground as explosions surround them. A parked car explodes after taking a direct hit. On Klochkivska Street, graphic videos shows blood and body parts outside of a small grocery store. ""It's horrible, guys,"" a voice in the video says. ""Right in my part of the city. Boots and leg were removed, here's parts of brain."" Russian forces enter port city Russian-backed forces have also made gains down South. In the port city of Kherson -- west of Mariupol and north of the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014 -- Ukrainian defensive lines appear to have fallen and Russian military vehicles have been seen driving inside the city. The leader of the self-declared separatist region in Donetsk said he expects his forces to surround Mariupol on Tuesday. The town of Volnovakha, half-way between Mariupol and Donetsk, was almost completely surrounded, Denis Pushilin added. Ukraine has accused Russia of committing war crimes by targeting civilians, and on Monday, the International Criminal Court said it would open an investigation into Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- a move that was welcomed by Kyiv. The Kremlin has denied the accusations, repeatedly saying it is not targeting civilian areas. A humanitarian crisis As bitter fighting takes place across the country, many Ukrainians are fleeing the country at a pace that could turn into ""Europe's largest refugee crisis this century,"" the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said Tuesday. Some 677,000 people have fled Ukraine in ""less than a week"" with 150,000 having left in the last 24 hours alone, UNHCR's deputy High Commissioner Kelly Clements said Tuesday. Clements said the UNHCR launched ""emergency appeals"" to donors for $1.7 billion in humanitarian support for people in Ukraine and refugees. Many of them are women who have had to leave behind their fathers and husbands as men aged 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country. ""Families with small children are hunkered down in basements and subway stations or running for their lives to terrifying sounds of explosions and wailing sirens,"" UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said. ""Casualty figures are rising fast. This is the darkest hour for the people of Ukraine."" Foreigners are also desperately trying to leave the country, and some have found themselves waiting in the cold to get out. Others have endured racism from border guards. Some Ukrainians have opted to stay and join the resistance. Volunteers are pouring into the capital, where there's a feeling of defiance among many. Some are gathering bottles to make Molotov cocktails. This story has been updated.",17,5.707837561744212,1.237412297963647,4.470425263780564,10
2022-03-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/europe/nato-ukraine-russian-infiltrators-intl-cmd/index.html,"On NATO's doorstep, a former tourist hotspot in Ukraine digs in to resist 'Russian infiltrators'","A long line of men snakes out of an unassuming building in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on an overcast day. An officer tells them to come back later. Too many people, he says, had enlisted that morning at Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, the volunteer military unit of the country's armed forces. The scene recurs on nearly every street — office and manual workers, young and old, determined to take up arms. Nearly everyone here says they would rather die than see Russian ground forces enter their city. ""I don't have any fear. We've had a war for eight years. This is a fight for our freedom,"" said Taras Ischyk of the territorial defense, referring to the war Russian President Vladimir Putin sparked in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine eight years ago. Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine has so far left Lviv unscathed. Yet the city has been utterly transformed from a touristic hotspot that boasts picturesque cobble-stoned streets and baroque-style buildings to a hub of burgeoning resistance to Moscow's military assault. Checkpoints line the entrances to the city as volunteers fill up sandbags that fortify the city's perimeter as well as its inner-city government buildings. Ukrainian police are dressed in combat gear. Many businesses have answered a call by the region's authorities to join the war effort — namely by making Molotov cocktails. The war effort in Lviv follows a nationwide trend where Russia's invading forces have faced stiff resistance from both Ukraine's military, as well as civilians who have taken up arms, slowing down the offensive's progress significantly. Russia has acknowledged casualties but has yet to give exact figures, but US officials say the country has suffered heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected. In a press conference last week, Governor of the Lviv region Max Kozicki announced that Molotov cocktail production centers were being set up throughout the city, and called for a mass enlisting in the territorial defense. Yuri Zastavny has converted his Lviv beer brewery into a factory for Molotov cocktails. They've made hundreds so far, Zastavny says, and distributed them to civilian defense centers in the Lviv area. Zastavny was encouraged to do it by his employees, he told CNN. ""Everyone is mobilized to the highest extent possible ... people who have technical skills do technical things. People good at media do media things,"" he said. ""That's why I think Russia has no chance here."" The heightened sense of preparedness is an unexpected turn for Lviv. On the first day of Russia's invasion, several military facilities were attacked in the wider region. Every day since, air raid sirens have blared repeatedly. Across the city, people have descended into basements, re-emerging when the alarms stop. Just 50 miles away from the border with Poland, the city is on NATO's doorstep. When the US warned that an invasion was imminent, several Western embassies relocated there from the capital Kyiv, believing it to be safer. But that sense of security has since been shattered and the city's authorities already believe that they are the target of covert military operations by the Russian army. ""There are Russian infiltrators in Lviv. This is a fact,"" Governor Kozicki told CNN emphatically. The governor's office says they believe ""sabotage groups"" have been marking various spots in the city as targets for Russian forces to later attack. Neither the governor nor his office have provided evidence of the alleged infiltrators or the plots of the alleged sabotage groups, but the atmosphere in Lviv is thick with suspicion. Cafe-goers are sometimes frisked at the entrance. The city's inhabitants are much less forthcoming with journalists than they were prior to the invasion. ""I can barely remember what life was like a couple of days ago when everything was safe,"" said 30-year-old Sergei Kuchman, who has been receiving scores of fleeing Ukrainians at a hostel he manages. ""Everything changed in a moment."" At a historic church, Micha, 24, and his girlfriend inquire about bomb shelters; many people who don't have basements have taken cover in crypts. ""What we can't find is a proper shelter for an atomic attack,"" he said, his voice trailing off as his girlfriend gestures to him to stop talking. He ducks into an alleyway but the fear in his mind hangs in the air after he's left. On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin put his country's nuclear deterrence force on high alert, raising the specter of nuclear war. A few days ago, this would have been an unfathomable prospect, but no one here says they can put anything past Putin anymore, especially after he invaded Europe's second-biggest country last week. Hours before the invasion began, a group of men were meeting at a nondescript office on the ground floor of a Soviet-style building in the outskirts of Lviv. They were organizing a ""national resistance movement in Lviv,"" 42 year-old Andriy Djakovych said. Djakovych is a hulking, slow-moving man with labored breathing. He is a senior lecturer at the local police academy. When he served in his country's 2014 war against Russia in the Donbas region as a paramedic, he was left with a brain injury that means he can no longer serve in the army, or the territorial defense. Yet he still wants to join the resistance. He said his group had no name or political affiliations, and that they were operating on the belief that Lviv figured in Putin's invasion plans, even if to a milder degree than eastern and central parts of the country. ""I don't think (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky has prepared us for war,"" Djakovych said at the time. ""We want to create our own patriotic community that the state in Ukraine can rely on."" Days later, CNN met with Djakovych again. This time we were directed to a building in central Lviv where we used a password to enter. Djakovych's towering figure appeared in military attire. ""Patriot"" — the name of his little-known group — was emblazoned on his shoulder. The walls were draped with the flags of ultra-nationalist Ukrainian movements, including the paramilitary group Azov, whose logo is the Wolfsangel, a symbol appropriated by Nazi Germany. There were several swastikas in the room, including one on a candlestick. Other veterans, decked out in military attire, brandished rifles. The ""Patriots"" are still tight-lipped about their ideological affiliations, but their ultra-nationalist leanings conjures up a less visible, yet harrowing dimension of this conflict. ""I don't consider myself a Nazi or a neo-nazi,"" said Djakovych. ""I'm just a patriotic citizen of my country.""",17,1.9044923186256608,5.874038626813614,-3.969546308187953,15
2022-03-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/world/mars-rover-esa-iss-russia-nasa-scn/index.html,Europe's Mars rover 'very unlikely' to launch in 2022 due to Ukraine invasion,"It's very unlikely that Europe's first planetary rover will launch in 2022, the European Space Agency said Monday, given Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on the country as a result. The ExoMars Rover, a collaboration between ESA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos, had been on track to leave for Mars in September this year but ESA said ""the wider context"" made it unlikely. A formal decision would be made after analyzing all the options, the agency added. ""We are fully implementing sanctions imposed on Russia by our Member States,"" ESA said in the statement. ""We are assessing the consequences on each of our ongoing programmes conducted in cooperation with the Russian state space agency Roscosmos and align our decisions to the decisions of our Member States in close coordination with industrial and international partners (in particular with NASA on the International Space Station)."" Launch windows are delicate and timely for missions heading to Mars from Earth. The rover, known as both ExoMars and Rosalind Franklin in honor of the English chemist and DNA pioneer, was initially scheduled to launch in July 2020 but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. The ESA also canceled a live Q&A session with Matthias Maurer, an ESA astronaut currently on board the International Space Station. In addition to Maurer, there are currently four NASA astronauts and two Russian cosmonauts living and working on board the orbiting outpost. NASA said Monday there were no signs Russia was withdrawing its support from the International Space Station as a result of US sanctions, despite that possibility being raised by Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin last week. ""We are not getting any indications at a working level that our counterparts are not committed to ongoing operation on the International Space Station. We as a team are operating just like we're operating three weeks ago,"" said Kathy Lueders, NASA's associate administrator for space operations. ""Our teams -- our flight controllers -- are still talking together. ... We're still doing training together. We're still working together. Obviously. We understand the global situation where it is. But as a joint team, these teams are operating together."" In response to a question on NASA's backup plans for the space station should Russia pull out, she said that aerospace and defense company Northrup Grumman had offered a reboost capability. ""And, you know, our SpaceX folks are looking at can we have additional capability,"" she said. Impact on the International Space Station Rogozin had said on Thursday that US sanctions have the potential ""to destroy our cooperation"" on the International Space Station. The ISS, which is a collaboration between the US, Russia, Japan, Canada and ESA, is divided into two sections -- the Russian Orbital Segment and the US Orbital Segment. The US segment provides power, while the Russian side provides the propulsion that keeps the ISS afloat. ""The Russian segment can't function without the electricity on the American side, and the American side can't function without the propulsion systems that are on the Russian side,"" former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman told CNN last week. ""You can't do an amicable divorce,"" Reisman said. ""You can't do a conscious uncoupling.""",3,8.118813773920932,8.460241359083218,-0.3414275851622861,11
2022-03-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/europe/kyiv-freezing-conditions-residents-tuesday-intl/index.html,Freezing temperatures add to Kyiv's problems as Russian troops approach Ukrainian capital,"Residents of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv are facing worsening conditions as a Russian military column more than 40 miles long bears down on the city. Thousands of residents are sheltering in unheated basements, underground parking lots and subway stations and a sudden cold snap has blanketed the city with snow, making the situation even more difficult. Viktoriya and her family say leaving their Kyiv home to spend the night in a bomb shelter may have saved their lives. When they returned on Tuesday morning, they discovered that bullets had pierced two windows in their apartment overnight. One of them shattered an electrical socket nearby, leaving a hole where the plug would normally go. ""I realized there is no place where I can feel safe now,"" said Viktoriya, 38, who asked CNN not to use her full name. ""My home is not my castle any more. All the time, something is thundering, exploding, shooting."" And she said there is no relief when things go quiet. ""It becomes even more anxious in the moments of silence, because you know they are not going to last,"" she said. Viktoriya says she and her family have been spending most of their time in the shelter, since they have a small son and worry about being able to keep him safe in their apartment. Many other families with children use the shelter, she says, so they can keep each other company; the adults also find it comforting being around each other and sharing the burden of worry and the feeling of hopelessness. ""Life changed completely in just a moment, and you can't influence the situation in any way,"" she said. ""Now it's no longer you who controls your life, but someone else. And whatever you decide: Whether to stay in Kyiv living in the basement or to go somewhere where it's calmer, it means the same, you have to leave home."" ""The war has only lasted four days so far, but it seems like it has been with us for an infinitely long time. It's a terrible 'Groundhog Day' feeling,"" she added. People have spent hours waiting in long lines at grocery stores and pharmacies in the city since they opened for the first time following a 36-hour curfew on Monday. For now, the city's key infrastructure is holding up. Electricity, heat and water are available as normal, but fears of potential disruptions to supplies have ratcheted up, as the Russian military closes in on the city. The 40-mile-long (64-kilometer) Russian military convoy -- made up of armored vehicles, tanks, towed artillery and other logistical vehicles -- has reached the outskirts of Ukraine's capital, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies. US officials who were previously surprised by fierce resistance that saw ordinary citizens take up arms to fight the invasion now fear the situation is becoming ""a lot more challenging"" for Ukrainians. The officials said in a briefing on Monday that Russia would likely lay siege to Kyiv, leading to ugly scenes of urban warfare, one of the people familiar with the matter said. And on Tuesday afternoon, Russian military warned it would carry out strikes against the facilities of the SBU -- Ukraine's State Security Agency -- and the 72nd Main Center for Information and Psychological Operations [PSO] in Kyiv. The statement from the Russian Defense Ministry urged residents near some targets to ""leave their homes,"" Russian state news agency TASS reported.",17,6.923582652275169,6.378256976979502,0.5453256752956666,1

Officials spoke to their overall preparedness during a news briefing ahead of the address, which will see hundreds of lawmakers gather in the House chamber and is designated as a National Special Security Event. Under the federal designation, the US Secret Service is the lead agency for the design and implementation of the operational security plan. During such an event, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is responsible for response and recovery operations, and the FBI is the lead for investigative work and counterterrorism. ""Certainly, the events abroad are, not only just in the physical space, but also in cyberspace,"" said Christopher Rodriguez, director of Washington's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, noting the potential threat from Russia in the form of cyberattacks and disinformation. ""There is the potential for Russian disinformation,"" Rodriguez said during the briefing, standing alongside Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and local and federal law enforcement officials. ""This wouldn't be the first time the Russians have done that across the United States in the last several years."" Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee told reporters Monday that the department is receiving help from the Philadelphia and Baltimore police departments. Capitol Police are on high alert as well, requesting installation of a fence around the inner perimeter of the Capitol grounds to bolster security. Customs and Border Protection's Air and Marine Operations will provide aerial support to the Secret Service for the event, according to a CBP spokesperson. The skies near Washington will be more restricted than usual during the address. A bulletin to pilots published by the Federal Aviation Administration says special provisions that typically allow small aircraft to fly in an area 30 nautical miles from the city will be suspended from 8 to 11 p.m. ET on Tuesday. Pilots will still be able to land and take off from Dulles International, Baltimore-Washington International and Manassas Regional airports, so long as they file a certain type of flight plan and are talking with air traffic controllers via radio. Officials prepare for potential trucker convoys Contee told reporters that a trucker convoy would be allowed into the city, but the department is prepared for possible disruptions. Further, Contee said truckers who refuse to move may face arrest. ""Obviously, we'd like to get voluntary compliance,"" Contee said. ""If we have someone who fails to obey the lawful directive of an officer, a traffic officer in this sense -- you know, 'Hey move your vehicle out of the roadway,' that type of thing -- that person ultimately ... could be arrested for that type of behavior and disruption."" Officials across the region have been preparing for disruptions from truckers for more than a week. Concerns over security prompted both US Capitol Police and Bowser to request National Guard assistance. The Department of Defense has approved 700 members of the National Guard and 50 large tactical vehicles. Over the weekend, the Department of Homeland Security warned state and local officials that the reported convoys headed to the Washington, DC, region could create public safety issues and have the potential to attract domestic violent extremists. However, federal law enforcement agencies have ""not observed any substantiated threats of violence"" from extremists, according to a DHS intelligence notice issued Saturday and obtained by CNN. Some people are discussing plans to organize large semi-truck convoys to Washington, DC with the goal of interrupting military and police security near the US Capitol during a range of potential dates in March and April, the document said, based off FBI reporting. The planned arrival to the region around the State of the Union ""could raise the public profile of any associated convoys that do materialize, increasing the likelihood that the protest activity could attract some domestic violent extremists,"" the notice said. Although there is no substantiated threat of violence, the threat of attack during a convoy event ""probably is elevated,"" according to the notice, because aspects of the convoy complaints overlap with domestic violent extremist grievances related to Covid-19 restrictions. Covid-19 mitigation measures have been a ""key driver"" of domestic extremist violence over the past two years, it said. ""We have resources that are deployed, very much coordinating with all of our federal partners here to make sure that we have a safe State of the Union, and peaceful First Amendment assembly, whatever day it shows up,"" he said during a news conference with federal and local officials. The enhanced security posture will be in place ""as long as it needs to be in place,"" Contee added. Homeland Security officials have been warning of the potential for disruption from US-based convoys since before the Super Bowl earlier this month. Reports of various convoys have sprung up in the past few weeks only to fizzle out without materializing into a substantial protest. On Monday, CNN affiliate KOAM reported that the ""People's Convoy,"" which started in California, had stopped in Missouri enroute to Washington, DC. The size and plans of the convoy are unclear. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and other DHS officials met Friday with Bowser and her public safety team to prepare for joint security efforts ahead of the State of the Union address and in anticipation of potential trucker convoys. During the meeting Friday, officials discussed a variety of options to help the city manage potential convoy disruptions, such as the possibility of revoking commercial driver's licenses if warranted, a source said. Additionally, to prevent DC from becoming the first and last line of defense against the convoy, the group discussed involving mayors and city officials along the convoy route as needed, according to the source. There was also discussion, the source said, of whether weigh stations along the route could be used to hold back some of the trucks and prevent hundreds of trucks from arriving at once. On Monday, Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a tweet that the Biden administration had requested the assistance of state National Guards to deploy to Washington. ""I have rejected this request -- there will be no @FLGuard sent to D.C. for Biden's State of the Union,"" he tweeted. Asked about the governor's assertion, Contee said that ""we will be using the DC National Guard for the Metropolitan Police Department"" for State of the Union security. ""That was the mayor's request for that and her insistence, as a matter of fact, that we have the DC National Guard for DC streets,"" he said about the city's posture. According to two defense officials, there was no request for other states to provide National Guard support for the State of the Union. There was a general request for help supporting the region as it relates to the potential trucker convoy. Approximately 100 members of the New Jersey and Vermont National Guards and 80 members of the West Virginia National Guard are providing support for the potential trucker convoys, but the Florida National Guard is not providing any such support.

2022-02-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/politics/us-kyiv-fears/index.html,US officials fear the worst is yet to come for Kyiv,"Ukrainian forces have so far managed to stave off Russian ground forces massed less than 20 miles north of the embattled capital Kyiv -- but though they've defied US intelligence predictions that the city would likely fall within one to four days of a full-scale Russian assault, US officials warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin could imminently increase the intensity of the attack. Stiffer than expected Ukrainian resistance and Russia's own logistical missteps have bogged down Russia's advance, US and western officials say, sparking a fragile optimism. The US has also continued sharing downgraded intelligence with the Ukrainians, including about Russian military moves, in an attempt to help Ukraine on the battlefield, two of the sources told CNN. But intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance. ""From a purely military/tactical standpoint, Russia has the manpower and firepower to take Kyiv. No question,"" said an American source familiar with the intelligence. ""And no matter how much resistance the Ukrainians put up."" Roughly a quarter of Russia's amassed troops have yet to enter Ukraine, a senior defense official told reporters on Monday -- a potential ""second wave,"" according to two sources familiar with the intelligence -- and defense officials say Putin could yet order a far less restrained bombing campaign, including airstrikes, long-range missiles and artillery. ""They have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on Kyiv, and one of the things that could result is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt in both the size and the scale of their targeting of Kyiv,"" a senior defense official told reporters on Monday. Administration officials warned lawmakers in classified briefings Monday that a ""second wave"" of Russian troops will likely consolidate the country's positions within Ukraine and by sheer numbers be able to overcome the Ukrainian resistance, according to two people familiar with the briefings. ""That part was disheartening,"" one lawmaker told CNN. The officials also said Russia was likely going to lay siege to Kyiv and predicted ugly scenes of urban warfare, one of the people familiar with the matter said. And at the end of the day, officials tracking the campaign say, the ugly truth remains that Ukraine is massively outgunned and outmanned -- even as Russia has made what military strategists say are a number of obvious blunders. Already, Russia appears to be ramping up its campaign in the east and the south. In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Russian forces have launched rocket attacks on at least one residential neighborhood that have killed civilians, according to Ukrainian officials and multiple social media videos geolocated by CNN. Meanwhile, in the small southern city of Mykolaiv, located on an inlet that would be a useful access point for Russians to bring in troops and supplies, the fighting has been among the most intense in Ukraine in recent days. Concerns about Putin's state of mind Perhaps most ominously, western officials are also warily watching Putin, under pressure from crushing economic penalties that have tanked the ruble and caused the Russian stock market to close. They fear those sanctions, combined with the lack of progress in Kyiv, may cause the unpredictable Russian leader to lash out even more. Senior US lawmakers familiar with the intelligence, western officials and former senior US officials with deep experience in Russia have begun to openly raise questions about the Russian leader's mental stability. ""Putin has been completely isolated, partly because of Covid,"" said the American source familiar with the intelligence. ""He's now basically just by himself, completely cut off from most of his advisers, isolated geographically ... the only people talking to him are sycophants who are just feeding his resentment."" The source added that the intelligence suggested Putin has not even been listening to his oligarchs -- traditionally the people who have had a key influence on his decision making. Questions about Putin's mental state arose during the classified briefings to lawmakers, but they were not clearly answered by the administration officials, the sources familiar with the briefings said. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who attended the Senate briefing, confirmed that Putin's mental state came up, but he declined to elaborate on what had been shared. He said, however, that regardless of the briefing, he personally is worried about Putin's mental state. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted Friday that ""it's pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin,"" hinting that his assessment was based on intelligence briefings. ""He has always been a killer, but his problem now is different & significant. It would be a mistake to assume this Putin would react the same way he would have 5 years ago."" On Sunday, Putin ordered Russia's nuclear forces into ""special combat readiness,"" a heightened alert status that the Biden administration has characterized as part of a pattern of unprovoked escalation and ""manufactured threats."" Holding back? Five days into its multipronged assault on Ukraine, Russia has suffered repeated logistical failures that defense officials and independent military analysts say are largely of its own making. Russian mechanized forces that have been the tip of the spear have often outpaced their own sustainment units carrying fuel and other supplies, leaving the support units open to ambush and stranding forward-advancing forces without fuel in the tank. ""Whether they outran [sustainment capabilities] or whether they just didn't plan properly for it, or whether they just simply didn't execute their plan for it, I don't know,"" said the senior defense official. But, ""on day 4, they're running out of gas and they've having logistics problems. Our assessment was that they did not believe they would be having those kinds of problems that early on."" Meanwhile, western officials have cheered on a better-than-anticipated showing by Ukrainian forces, in particular how effective they have been using western-provided Stinger shoulder-fired missiles and anti-aircraft artillery to take down an unknown number of Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. ""The Russians don't have complete control of the airspace of the entire country,"" said the senior western intelligence official. ""In the areas in which the Russian military operations are the most intense on the ground, those are the areas where the Russians have the most control over the airspace in terms of air to air."" But Western officials still aren't entirely sure why Russia has held back some forces outside of Ukraine's borders, or why Russia has not yet carried out the kind of electronic warfare against Ukraine the west had been anticipating -- like massive hacking campaigns and attacks on critical infrastructure. One official said the US believes Russia has been holding back on severing communications on the ground -- a tactic the west had expected early but has yet to happen -- because the Russian military forces need that infrastructure to communicate amongst themselves. As for the troops left on the border, it's possible that Russia has planned the attack in waves in an effort to exhaust the Ukrainians with the first wave and then demolish them with a second wave of fresh troops, according to two sources familiar with the intelligence. It's also possible, according to one of those sources, that Russia has simply moved cautiously after facing a tougher fight than expected. At this point, officials said, it's impossible to put a timeline on how long Ukrainian forces will be able to hold the Russians at the gates of Kyiv. ""I can't put a number [on how long Kyiv lasts],"" the senior western intelligence official said. ""I can't tell you it's going to be hours or days. ""While the Ukrainians are putting on a stiff defense, and a much better one than I think the Russians anticipated, there will be a time where they will run out of ammunition. There will come a time where they run out of fuel and they can't move,"" this person said. ""We are mindful of that and they are mindful of that.""

2022-02-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/europe/putin-stiff-opposition-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html,Vladimir Putin is facing stiffer opposition than expected -- both inside and outside Ukraine,"Five days into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it seems things haven't gone exactly to plan for Vladimir Putin so far. Western intelligence officials briefed repeatedly over the weekend that Russian forces have encountered ""stiffer than expected"" resistance from an outmanned and outgunned Ukrainian military. Russia has thus far failed to take key cities across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv. On Sunday, Ukrainian forces successfully repelled a Russian advance on a strategic airfield near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which has been under near-constant attack. In addition to a fierce fightback from Ukrainian forces and civilians, the Russian invasion has suffered logistical challenges, with soldiers on the front line running short of fuel, ammunition and food. ""They are having problems,"" a NATO official said of the Russian forces, pointing to the alliance's latest intelligence. ""They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue."" But a senior US defense official told reporters on Sunday that Russia has only used two-thirds of the total combat power applied to the mission, leaving a significant amount of forces available to press the offensive. And on Monday, a miles-long convoy of Russian military vehicles was bearing down on the Ukrainian capital, while Kyiv's intelligence also suggests Belarus is prepared to join the Russian invasion, according to a Ukrainian official. Representatives from Ukraine and Russia were meeting Monday on the Belarusian border. In those talks, Ukraine will insist on an ""immediate ceasefire"" and the withdrawal of Russian troops -- though, realistically, no one is expecting that to happen. Putin, it seems, hasn't just misjudged Ukraine's ability to defend itself, but also just how hard a line the international community would take against Russia in the event of an invasion. For years, the Russian president has faced very little pushback from the West over his illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, his brutal support for the Syrian regime and acts of aggression in other countries. For all their strong words of condemnation for Putin and his regime, Western countries still bought gas from Russia, offered a safe haven to Russian oligarchs and retained relatively normal diplomatic relations with Moscow. But this time around -- despite a few early rocky patches which saw Western nations accused of not hitting Russia hard enough -- Putin has faced an unusually united Western alliance. From unprecedented sanctions that are already hurting the Russian economy to international sport slowly turning on Moscow, Russia's international pariah status becomes more acute by the hour. The economic pain will only get worse as time goes on. The ruble lost about 20% of its value against the dollar on Monday afternoon, and Russia's central bank has raised interest rates from 9.5% to 20%, a move that will hit Russian citizens in their pockets., Those same citizens might soon wonder just why Putin is risking so much for a war that didn't need to happen. Of course, things are very fluid on the ground and could change very quickly. There's little hope that Monday's talks will yield a deescalation, and no one expects this war to end in the immediate future -- either by force or by agreement. But it's likely that Putin, having come this far, will throw more at Ukraine in the coming days. However, as the invasion enters its second week, it's impossible to ignore the fact that Putin's best-laid plans have been met with firmer resistance than he -- and many of his opponents -- ever imagined.",14,1.515859311916389,1.840850997664452,-0.32499168574806303,21

The attack and explosions were launched as Russia becomes increasingly isolated from the rest of the world, particularly Western nations, which have been imposing a rash of sanctions on the country since it launched its invasion of Ukraine last week. The bombardment in the city of Kharkiv on Monday killed nine civilians, including three children, and wounded 37 others, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. CNN is reaching out to Russian authorities for comment on the attack. According to social media videos geolocated by CNN, multiple rockets were seen exploding closely together in a residential part of the Saltivka neighborhood, near a supermarket in the northeast of the city, which the Russian military has frequently targeted. Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova described the situation in Kharkiv as ""hellish"" and shared a video on Facebook of a missile that hit a kitchen window and tore off the leg of a woman, who she said later died in hospital. As talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials ended early Monday evening, CNN reporters in Kyiv heard several large detonations, followed by sirens going off across the city. Both sides discussed a potential ""ceasefire and the end of combat actions on the territory of Ukraine,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhaylo Podolyak told reporters. Without going into detail, Podolyak said that both sides would return to their capitals for consultations over whether to implement a number of ""decisions."" ""The parties discussed holding another round of negotiations where these decisions can develop,"" he said. Ukraine had earlier demanded an ""immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky's office said earlier Monday. Zelensky earlier downplayed the significance of the talks, which he is not attending in person. ""I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,"" he said Sunday. Russians face determined resistance While Ukrainians have attached little hope in the talks yielding a pathway to peace, the opportunities to deescalate the conflict appear to be quickly shrinking. Fighting has intensified in Ukraine in the past day in a number of strategic cities. A senior US defense official told reporters on Monday that taking Kharkiv ""remains an objective"" for the Russians, and ""they continue to try to advance on"" the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. But the Russians have not taken either city yet, the official said. The official explained that if Russia captures both cities ""you can see that would allow them to section off the eastern part of Ukraine,"" the official said. On Monday, CNN reporters witnessed at least three ""Uragan"" multiple rocket launchers in the Russian side of the border south of Belgorod heading towards the Kharkiv front line. They saw three launchers and a loading vehicle with missiles on it. Russia's larger and far better-equipped military has, however, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow's attempts to swiftly take control of key cities. Western allies have been increasing its assistance to Ukraine through funds and weapons to aid its defense. Ukraine said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at the city from Belarus Sunday, and claimed a successful drone attack against a Russian BUK surface-to-air missile system near the capital. But Western military assessments caution that Ukrainian forces cannot holdout indefinitely. On Monday, it appeared the the bulk of Russian ground forces were more than 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) north of Kyiv, according to an intelligence update by the the UK's Ministry of Defense. The advance of those troops was slowed by stiff Ukrainian resistance at the nearby Hostomel airfield, ""a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict,"" the ministry said. The Russian military announced what it described as an ""open and safe"" corridor for civilians to leave the capital on Monday, while repeating a baseless claim that the Ukrainian government was using residents as a ""human shield."" And while Ukrainian troops appear to be holding ground in the country's north, Russian forces have made some advances to the south. On Sunday Russian troops took control of Berdyansk -- a port city of 100,000 people on Ukraine's southern coast, and the site of a small naval base. The ongoing Russian assault has inflicted widespread suffering and casualties on the Ukrainian population. More than half a million refugees have fled Ukraine to neigboring countries, according to the UN's refugee agency. The number of known civilians killed in Ukraine stands at 352, with 14 of those children, Ukraine's Ministry of Interior said Sunday. Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces accused Russia of hitting civilian areas. ""In violation of the norms of international humanitarian law, the occupiers have insidiously inflicted missile strikes on residential buildings in Zhytomir and Chernyhiv,"" a statement said on Monday. CNN is unable to independently verify these claims. Concerns over nuclear confrontation Pressure is intensifying on the Kremlin as Western allies of Ukraine try to prop up the country with weapons and as Russia faces financial turmoil, with the ruble in free fall. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday raised the stakes by ordering his country's nuclear forces to be placed on high alert. Later on Sunday, Belarus renounced its non-nuclear status in a referendum, after the former Soviet nation became a launch pad for Russia's invasion in Ukraine last week. The vote in favor of a new constitution could theoretically allow Russia to place nuclear weapons back in Belarus for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, when Belarus gave up its stockpile and became a nuclear free zone. Addressing journalists at a polling station in Minsk, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said he could ask Putin to ""return the nuclear weapons"" Belarus gave away if the West transferred any nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania. Ukrainian intelligence also indicated Belarus could be preparing to ""participate directly"" in the invasion of Ukraine, according to two sources close to the Ukrainian government. Lukashenko said last week that Belarusian troops could join the invasion ""if it becomes necessary."" Meanwhile, the UK said it will provide an additional $53 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and British leaders plan to introduce legislation in Parliament aimed at clamping down on Russian money laundering and fraud. And Australian travel bans and targeted financial sanctions against Putin and senior members of his government went into effect Monday, the country's Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed in a statement. South Korea and Singapore on Monday also announced new sanctions on Russia.",17,2.5990496374698386,3.202232312450451,-0.6031826749806122,29

Along Ukraine's strategic Black Sea coast, Russian forces are playing a strange game, testing defenses, spilling blood and raising tensions but failing to drive home any significant gains. The small city of Mykolaiv, located on an inlet that would be a useful access point for Russians to bring in troops and supplies, was on Monday picking up the pieces from a weekend of heavy fighting that saw Ukrainian hardware destroyed and civilians targeted. Broken glass and burnt-out tanks littered the streets. The skyline was dominated by the unusual site of a raised road bridge, the structure elevated for the first time in years to hamper any further ground incursions. And in the air, as well as the sound of intermittent air raid sirens, the mystery of what Russia's probing attacks in Mykolaiv and other Black Sea towns are trying to achieve. They've clearly managed to instill fear. Ukrainian troops were on edge in the wake of the fighting, wary of the threat of saboteurs. As CNN toured the city, we saw people pulled from cars and thrown to the ground, suspected to be infiltrators. Ukrainian troops were trying to put on a brave face. Guarding the wreckage of military vehicles, clearly hit by a ballistic missile with significant firepower, one soldier initially claimed they were Russian before admitting they belonged to Ukrainian forces. The fighting along this region of the Black Sea has been some of the most intense in Ukraine in the past few days, with unconfirmed reports of Russian paratroopers on the ground, as well as very visible blasts lighting up the skyline. Yet, in similar strikes on other towns, it's been almost the same picture. Intense Russian bombardment followed by a pause that has allowed the Ukrainian side to claim victory. In Kherson, 70 kilometers southeast of Mykolaiv, CNN witnessed the aftermath of another intense battle focused on a major road bridge. Here again the scene was littered by the remains of Ukrainian tanks and guns abandoned or destroyed by what looked like Russian airstrikes. Proximity is clearly a factor in the attacks. The region lies close to the Crimean peninsula, which has been held by Russia since annexation in 2014. And there's an obvious strategic prize, further west along the coast. Capture of the large Ukraine port of Odessa would be a major gain in the conflict which has so far not seen the fall of any key cities. Asked about how he felt living in Mykolaiv following the strikes, one soldier standing amid piles of broken glass from blown out apartment windows spoke angrily of broken Russian promises about not targeting civilian infrastructure. If Russia is hoping to convince Ukrainian civilians of its stated goal of offering them protection, these attacks appear designed to do the opposite.",17,2.18124276254732,1.5007863855039907,0.6804563770433294,29
2022-02-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/europe/kharkiv-street-fight-russia-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html,One battle in Kharkiv shows how Ukraine is fighting back against the Russian invasion,"Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, is believed to have been one of the invading Russian military's first strategic targets. Home to 1.4 million people, it is located less than 20 miles from the Russian border, in northeast Ukraine. It was approached by Russian troops shortly after the invasion began last Thursday, but for three days, Ukrainian forces held the Russians at bay. Then, on Sunday, Russian troops entered the city according to the region's governor, Oleh Synehubov. What happened next offers clues to the fierce resistance Russian soldiers are meeting in Ukraine's towns and cities -- and to why they have not yet advanced as quickly as experts initially feared they would. ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine are eliminating the enemy,"" Synehubov reassured the residents of Kharkiv that day. Videos uploaded to social media give a rare glimpse of the clashes on the city's streets. One sequence of videos uploaded to social media show an attempt by a Russian unit to advance towards an important airfield and arms factory in the northeast of Kharkiv. The airfield, at the Kharkiv State Aircraft Manufacturing Company, is small -- just a single runway -- but might be a useful bridgehead for the Russians. CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the videos. The first video, taken by a resident, shows a convoy of Russian troops surrounding military vehicles, creeping along a roadway that ends near the airfield. ""There are two [military vehicles] as far as I can see,"" someone says in the video. ""A third one is crawling through with infantry with automatic weapons, getting ready."" Suddenly, gunfire is heard and seen. A Russian soldier kneels quickly and fires a shoulder-launched rocket towards the area where the gunfire appears to be coming from. A second video, taken after the firefight, shows the military vehicles reversing in an apparent retreat. The Russian troops are seen huddled behind their vehicles. A Reuters journalist who went to the location after the firefight shot video showing one of the Russian vehicles from the military convoy abandoned and a significant amount of blood staining the snow on the ground nearby. The Reuters journalist spoke with a resident, identified as Yevgeniy, who told them that at least one Russian soldier had been killed there. ""After we've killed this one the others run away,"" Yevgeniy told Reuters, pointing to a patch of blood in the snow. He tells the journalist there were between 12 and 15 people in the group. ""They won't take Kharkiv,"" he insists. ""They have run back to where they came from. They don't have good navigation you see. Nothing works for them. They came and were hiding behind the houses."" The troops' efforts to retreat appear to have been stopped by another attack. A convoy of vehicles -- of the same type as those seen in the previous clips -- is seen on fire in another video. ""This is how we greet the b*tch Russian army,"" someone is heard shouting in the video. ""Come here and blindfold him. And this will happen to anyone who comes to us here on Kharkiv soil."" It's not possible to say definitively that the Russian trucks seen on fire are the same as those filmed trying to reach the airport, but they are in the same location, are the same type, and bear the same markings. Another video apparently taken later at the site of the abandoned military convoy -- the vehicles are no longer on fire -- shows Ukrainian troops engaging. Amid the firefight, a Ukrainian soldier steps out from the wall and is seen firing a shoulder-launched rocket. Watching the video, retired Gen. Mark Hertling, national security and military analyst for CNN, said the Ukrainian unit was equipped with rocket-propelled grenades. ""You see that force, that small squad there of about 10 guys, the guy up furthest away from us is repeatedly firing rocket-propelled grenades, he's fired by my count about five of them, he is handing off the launcher to another guy, they are reloading and he is ready to shoot again,"" he said. ""And everybody else, you look at the cool, calm, collected approach by these soldiers under fire, they're not afraid, they're ready to kick some butt,"" he added. Later, another video shows Ukrainian troops around the convoy, appearing to rummage through the abandoned vehicles. Sporadic gunfire is heard and some Ukrainian forces move along a wall in the background. ""Slava Ukraini,"" says someone in the video (""glory to Ukraine""). Swift response But on Monday, Russian troops returned to the northeastern suburbs of Kharkiv and renewed their attack on the city. Multiple social media videos geolocated by CNN show rockets exploding closely together in a residential area of the Saltivka neighborhood, close to a supermarket. One showed a rocket booster lodged in the street pavement, as civilians looked on. ""It's more hellish in Kharkiv today than it was yesterday,"" said Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova, posting on Facebook. According to Kharkiv City Council, the latest shelling left one female civilian dead, and 31 people -- 15 servicemen and 16 civilians -- wounded. In recent days, the city council has recorded seven fatalities -- two servicemen and five civilians -- and 44 wounded, including 20 servicemen. ""Kharkiv has just been subjected to massive Grad shelling! Dozens of victims,"" Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs, said Monday describing the situation there as ""a nightmare."" Russia maintains that it does not target civilians.",17,0.8416042591166517,2.432860891289014,-1.5912566321723622,15
2022-02-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/politics/russian-ukraine-resistance/index.html,"Russian invasion runs into stiff resistance, supply lines are a 'definite vulnerability,' US officials say","Russia's invasion of Ukraine is encountering ""stiffer than expected"" resistance from the Ukrainian military as well as unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge tell CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated. In addition, Russia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, a senior dedfense official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. ""Ukrainian air defenses, including aircraft, do continue to be operable and continue to engage and deny access to Russian aircraft in places over the country,"" the official said. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air. Together, these challenges have so far prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine's border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces, which officials worried could happen on the first night of an invasion. Officials caution that this picture of the battlefield is just a moment in time, and the situation on the ground could change very quickly as Russian forces keep up their assault. These officials noted that Russian forces still greatly outnumber Ukrainian forces, and Russia continues to maneuver these forces into position around major urban centers. It's also unclear how much of the slower movement can be attributed to the logistical challenge of moving such a large force. The Ukrainian military has a number of different anti-aircraft weapons, including radar-guided and heat-seeking missiles, as well as anti-aircraft guns, according to IHS Janes. The US has also provided the Ukrainian military with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles in recent weeks, as have other NATO allies. As of Saturday evening in Ukraine, the US had not seen any indication that the Russian military has taken control over any Ukrainian cities, the official said, even as Russian forces have moved to surround some population centers, including Kyiv. Keeping Russia's large invasion force supplied with fuel and ammunition has also proved difficult. As one senior US official explained, Russia anticipated a fast victory and may have neglected to plan for sufficient resupply of its forces. Supply lines, this official explained, are a ""definite vulnerability."" ""What we assess now is that he had to commit a bit more logistics and sustainment, in fuel specifically, than what we believe they had planned to do this early in the operation,"" said one of the officials. Russia's forces launched their invasion of Ukraine early Thursday morning, with missiles landing in cities across the country. US officials have said Moscow's goal is to take Kyiv and ""decapitate"" the government led by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky turned down an offer from the US to evacuate from Kyiv, the Ukraine Embassy in Britain wrote Saturday on Twitter. Zelensky has posted videos on social media showing he's remained in Ukraine. ""The world has seen that Ukrainians are powerful, Ukrainians are courageous, they're on their native land, and they're never going to give it up to anyone. They will never betray it,"" he said in an address Saturday. Russia has spun their slow advance in Ukraine as a stop to allow time for negotiations, not a military setback. On Saturday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said its troops have been ordered to resume their offensive ""in all directions,"" after a suspension was ordered for negotiations with the Ukrainian government. The ministry said the offensive was ordered to continue after Ukraine abandoned the consultations. A Ukrainian presidential adviser denied in the early hours Saturday that Ukraine had refused to negotiate. ""They are having problems,"" a NATO official said of the Russian forces, pointing to the alliance's latest intelligence. ""They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue."" Asked whether the Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. ""They are way behind schedule,"" the official said. ""This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful."" Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who has also remained in Kyiv, said in an interview Saturday on CNN that the Ukrainian military has displayed ""exceptional heroism"" but that the country still needs more help from its allies in receiving weapons like anti-tank missiles.",14,2.424463135995495,7.376344993609778,-4.951881857614283,21
2022-02-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/politics/putin-russia-ukraine-international-law-what-matters/index.html,Putin vs. the entire concept of international law,"By invading Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin violated his neighbor's sovereignty and threw the notion of international law out the window. Afraid of one organization, NATO, Putin ignored the principles of another organization, the United Nations, as well as an agreement known as the Budapest Memorandum, signed by Russia and specifically meant to protect Ukraine from invasion. RELATED: Get the latest developments on the ground in Ukraine. Did Putin violate international law? I put the simple question to Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University and co-editor-in-chief of Just Security, an online forum. Here's what he wrote in an email: Russia has brazenly violated the core provision of the UN Charter by invading another member State. Putin's actions are a textbook example of the crime of aggression, which was considered the supreme international crime by the Nuremberg Tribunal following World War II. What about the UN? Formed after World War II in 1945 to prevent future wars, the UN Security Council includes five permanent members who are major world powers: the US, China, France, the United Kingdom and Russia. Other members are elected by the General Assembly on a rotating basis for two-year terms. The Security Council's main objective is to ""to maintain international peace and security."" No country is supposed to invade another without the go-ahead by the Security Council. Clearly that did not happen here, although Russia did seek to justify its move on Ukraine with a number of allegations, all of which the US predicted beforehand and says are false. Russia presides over the Security Council It is a bizarre irony that at this moment when it goes to war on a neighbor, Russia is serving as president of the UN Security Council. It's a matter of some coincidence, since the presidency rotates monthly. But Russia's status as a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power over all substantive measures means there will be no sanctions against Russia from the UN, although member countries have imposed their own punishments. Indeed, Russia vetoed a draft resolution condemning its invasion of Ukraine Friday night. Eleven countries supported the resolution, and three -- China, India and the United Arab Emirates -- abstained. A low point I asked CNN's Richard Roth, who has covered the UN for decades, how this invasion by Russia at a time when it is president of the Security Council will test the organization. ""One of the biggest embarrassments inside the UN in the thirty years I have kept my eyes on the place,"" is how he described things in an email. There is a move to change the rules. Roth pointed out that France, another permanent member of the Security Council, has campaigned, without success, for fewer votes by permanent members. Ukraine's ambassador to the UN, at a tense emergency meeting on Wednesday, asked Russia to relinquish its role as president of the Security Council. ""I really think it's a body blow for the UN,"" Roth said. ""The Secretary-General said it's his lowest moment on the job. They hold all these 'preventative diplomacy' sessions and retreats and consultations ... and then Russian tanks run right over the precious UN charter."" There have been previous examples of the US and NATO forces entering other countries, in Libya and Serbia. But there is a key difference, Roth said. ""In those cases there (were) war crimes to justify the actions, which infuriated Russia. Here Ukraine was a peaceful country."" What can be done at the UN without the Security Council? Goodman said member countries can go to the full UN General Assembly to condemn Russia. He also argued that sanctions and isolation from individual countries can work. ""The cultural boycotts and diplomatic isolation of Russia may go a long way as they did with apartheid South Africa to bring needed change,"" Goodman said. What about NATO? Four years after the formation of the UN, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created. NATO was specifically organized as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. But after the Soviet Union fell in 1991, multiple former Soviet republics joined NATO. It is because he feels that NATO is breathing down Russia's neck that Putin has moved into Ukraine. Article 5 protection. It is one thing for Putin to invade Ukraine, which is not a part of NATO. It would be something else entirely for him to move against a smaller NATO member, like the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. That would trigger Article 5 of the NATO charter, which stipulates that an attack on one member is an attack on all of them. The US, France, Germany and the UK, along with the rest of the 30-member NATO alliance, would be required to respond. Article 5 has only been invoked once, by the US after it was attacked by terrorists on September 11, 2001. It was a NATO alliance that went into Afghanistan. While President Joe Biden has strongly backed the NATO charter, former President Donald Trump routinely questioned it, before ultimately affirming it -- as CNN's Jeremy Herb wrote in 2017. He wrote that Article 5 extends beyond the concept of invasion and has helped bolster defenses for Turkey along its border with Syria, and added forces in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. NATO has also engaged in so-called peacekeeping missions, like the one that is still ongoing in Kosovo, and training and support activities around the Mediterranean and in Africa. Putin's most obvious violation Putin seemed to threaten any country that meddles with his invasion, obliquely referencing Russia's nuclear weapons. ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history,"" Putin said ominously this week, when he announced the attacks on Ukraine. It wasn't too long ago that Ukraine had nuclear weapons. In fact, as a former Soviet republic it had the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. After the fall of the Soviet Union, in 1994 as part of nonproliferation efforts, it signed onto the Budapest Memorandum. Under the agreement, Ukraine accepted that it would denuclearize in exchange for compensation from the US and Russia, and for security assurances from the US, the UK and Russia that its sovereignty would be protected. The agreement pushed Ukraine toward the Nonproliferation Treaty. The rest of the world and the rules Just because Putin chose to ignore international law and his own country's agreements does not mean international law is dead. The Yale University law professors Oona Hathaway and Scott Shapiro argue in a post for Just Security and Lawfare that the international response to Russia is proof the system is trying to work, since states have responded to Putin's aggression with condemnation and action. What happens next, and in the years to come, will be what determines the future of international law, they write: ""Plans should be made now to hold the alliance together as long as necessary—for years, and perhaps decades."" This could be one reason Biden has held some sanctions in reserve and been careful not to criticize Europe for not moving as swiftly against Russia as many American lawmakers would have liked. Among the plans Hathaway and Shapiro suggest are ways to erase Russia's leverage over Europe and protect smaller countries, like those in the Baltics, who fear Russia could move against them next.

2022-02-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/politics/ukraine-malware-warning-cybersecurity-fbi-cisa/index.html,"US firms should be wary of destructive malware unleashed on Ukraine, FBI and CISA warn","US critical infrastructure firms should reinforce their defenses and increase their vigilance following data-destroying cyberattacks in Ukraine prior to a large-scale Russian attack on the country, the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Saturday. ""Destructive malware can present a direct threat to an organization's daily operations, impacting the availability of critical assets and data,"" the US agencies said in a public advisory. ""Further disruptive cyberattacks against organizations in Ukraine are likely to occur and may unintentionally spill over to organizations in other countries."" The advisory includes several technical recommendations for organizations to keep malicious software from spreading on their systems. US officials continue to say there are ""no specific, credible"" threats to the US homeland tied to tensions with Russia over Ukraine, but Saturday's advisory is the latest warning from officials that what happens in cyberspace in Ukraine may not stay there. Just hours before Russian forces began to attack Ukraine early Thursday, cybersecurity researchers said they had found a data-wiping hacking tool on hundreds of computers belonging to the Ukrainian government and financial organizations. The malicious code is designed to delete data from computers and render them inoperable — which has the potential to hobble organizations trying to stay online during a war. Jean-Ian Boutin, head of threat research at anti-virus firm ESET, which responded to some of the destructive hacks, told CNN that he assumed that the malware was successfully deployed and the ""affected machines were wiped."" Two Ukrainian government contractors — one with a presence in Latvia and another with a presence in Lithuania (both NATO members) — were hit with the malware, according to Broadcom's cybersecurity unit Symantec. While the hack was targeted at Ukrainian assets, the potential for collateral damage in cyberspace during the war in Ukraine has been high on Western officials' minds. It's unclear who was responsible for deploying the destructive malware. It was the second such destructive hack in as many months. A similar piece of malicious code appeared on the systems of some Ukrainian government agencies and nonprofit and technology organizations in January. The White House has blamed Russia's GRU military intelligence agency for a separate cyberattack on Ukrainian government websites on February 15 that temporarily knocked the websites offline. Russia has denied the allegation. In a statement Saturday, CISA Director Jen Easterly said her agency has been working ""with our partners to identify and rapidly share information about malware that could threaten the operations of critical infrastructure here in the U.S.""",3,9.919710813474694,9.663920441825999,0.2557903716486951,23
2022-02-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-saturday-intl-hnk/index.html,Kyiv on heightened alert as Russian forces close in on all sides,"Two large explosions lit up the night sky south of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv early Sunday morning. The explosions appear to have been around Vasylkiv, which has a large military airfield and multiple fuel tanks and is about about 30 kilometers south of Kyiv. The latest development comes after Ukraine's outgunned forces held the capital for the third day on Saturday as battles continued across the country, while a defiant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told citizens to defend the country. A blast lit up the skyline on Saturday night in the strategic maritime city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine as heavy shelling reverberated around its outskirts. The sound of small arms fire and the impact of multiple rockets punctuated the night following a day of heightened tension in the city. A CNN crew saw Ukrainian troops fire warning shots and throw suspected Russian saboteurs from their cars to the ground. After unconfirmed reports of Russian paratroopers landing in the city's northern areas, a bridge was raised for the first time in years in a bid to cut a main connection between the north and south of the city -- which sits on an inlet from the Black Sea. As Russia's war of aggression moves to the streets of multiple Ukrainian cities, with Ukraine's outnumbered military continuing to hold back the invading forces in multiple locations, the Russian Ministry of Defense said its troops have been ordered to resume their offensive ""in all directions."" Ukraine's prime minister announced the country was closing its borders with Russia and Belarus beginning Monday, and only Ukrainian citizens would be able to cross into Ukraine from those two countries. A senior US defense official warned Saturday that more than half of Russian President Vladimir Putin's assembled power was ""now committed inside Ukraine."" Heavy fighting was ongoing in the northern city of Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border, while there was ""less resistance in the south,"" a US official said. In Vasilkiv, a town some 35 kilometers south of Kyiv, the mayor said Saturday morning that fierce fighting was taking place in the middle of the town. Vasilkiv Mayor Natalia Balasynovich said there were losses on the Ukrainian side with ""many wounded, unfortunately, they are in the 200s,"" she told the Ukrainian parliament channel Saturday. But Russia's invasion has not progressed as fast as Moscow would have expected, say Western intelligence officials. Britain's Ministry of Defense said Russia has yet to gain control of Ukrainian airspace ""greatly reducing the effectiveness of the Russian Air Force."" Russia has also faced ""acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance,"" slowing the speed of the Russian advance, the UK ministry said in a Saturday intelligence update shared on Twitter. But it stressed that the bulk of Russian forces are now only 18.6 miles from the center of Kyiv, warning that casualties are ""likely to be heavy and greater than anticipated or acknowledged by the Kremlin."" Despite being a prime target in the invasion, Zelensky turned down a US offer of evacuation, the Ukraine Embassy in Britain said Saturday on Twitter. ""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,"" Zelensky told the US, according to the embassy. Zelensky echoed the resolve of many Ukrainians -- some of whom have taken arms -- in a video message Saturday afternoon. ""We have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks. Fighting continues in different cities and regions of our country,"" he said. ""Each Ukrainian should keep one thing in mind: if you can stop and destroy the occupiers -- do it. Everyone who can come back to Ukraine -- come back to defend Ukraine,"" he said. Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, braced for a further night of fighting, imposing a curfew on the city, from 5 p.m. local (10 a.m. ET) to 8 a.m., beginning Saturday evening. He warned that civilians on the street after curfew will be considered ""members of the enemy's sabotage and reconnaissance groups."" The resistance to Russia's invasion has seen civilians prepare to defend their capital in recent days, with officials arming reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone and Ukrainian TV broadcasting instructions for making Molotov cocktails. In the northern city of Bakhmach, Ukrainian citizens attempted to stop Russian tanks by standing in front of them, according to videos seen by CNN. A Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher has been spotted by a CNN team south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon. The TOS-1 or TOS-1A Multiple Rocket Launcher seen by CNN is capable of launching rockets with thermobaric warheads. There is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine. These types of weapons do not use conventional ammunition. Instead, they are filled with high-temperature, high-pressure explosive. They are sometimes called ""vacuum bombs"" because they suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects. Early Saturday, a large residential apartment block in the west of Kyiv was struck by a missile or rocket, as residents across the city were forced to seek shelter after a terrifying night of fighting. Images and video from the scene showed a large impact some ten floors up in the building, with the cause of the strike unclear and the extent of casualties unknown. Several apartment units were blown out entirely, their outer walls and windows missing, leaving a gaping hole visible in the building's side, as residents were evacuated Ukrainian troops are fighting against a significantly more advanced military power. Russian defense spending is roughly ten times that of Kyiv's and its armed forces stand at some 900,000 active personnel and 2 million in reserve, versus Ukraine's 196,000 and 900,000 reservists. The Russian Defense Ministry has not reported a single combat casualty from the invasion, a CNN review of their news releases shows. But Zelensky has claimed that the country's forces have killed ""hundreds"" of Russian soldiers, without providing an exact figure. On Friday morning, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said Russia had lost more than 450 personnel. Ukrainian officials have acknowledged casualties on their side. CNN has been unable to independently verify casualty figures. Room for diplomacy? There have been suggestions of efforts toward diplomacy to stop the bloodshed, with Zelensky's senior adviser, Myhailo Podoliak, on Saturday morning saying Ukraine would set conditions in any process, noting he didn't think the country had ""weak positions."" A separate spokesperson for Zelensky, Sergii Nykyforov, late Friday said that Ukraine ""has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace."" Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a halt Friday to the Russian military's advance in Ukraine pending negotiations, but operations resumed after the government in Kyiv allegedly refused talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Saturday. Zelensky spokesperson Nykyforov had previously denied any ""claims that we have refused to negotiate."" ""The sooner negotiations begin, the better the chances of resuming normal life,"" he said. Western officials have been examining whether Zelensky could form a government in exile if he were to flee Kyiv, US officials told CNN. But those officials and a source close to Zelensky said the Ukrainian president has rebuffed those offers. The Russian Ministry of Defense in a statement Saturday, claimed to have taken control over the city of Melitopol in southeastern Ukraine. This comes after a massive explosion at Melitopol Airport was captured in footage shared on social media. Russia also launched cruise missile strikes overnight against targets in Ukraine. There have been reports of apartment buildings and kindergartens being shelled, civilians being killed, and rockets being found in residential streets since the beginning of the invasion earlier this week. Images analyzed by CNN confirmed that on several occasions densely populated areas have been hit by Russian forces around the country. Russia's invasion has been followed by sweeping sanctions by Western nations, designed to damage Russia's economy and turn Putin into an international ""pariah."" The White House, along with France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada, announced Saturday evening that they would expel certain Russian banks from SWIFT, the high-security network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world, pledging to ""collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin."" ""This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,"" they wrote in a joint statement released by the White House, also pledging ""restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions,"" and restricting the sale of ""golden passports"" that allow Russian oligarchs to avoid the brunt of sanctions already levied. Russia's decision to invade Ukraine has seen its allies like China struggle to balance its close strategic partnership with Moscow with its seemingly contradictory policy of supporting state sovereignty. China, which has declined to criticize Russia's attack, abstained on voting for a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Humanitarian crisis While the previous two nights in Kyiv were marked by the sounds of sporadic explosions coming from further away, Friday night in the capital was different for the residents who remained, with bursts of small arms fire and visible orange lines of fire going up into the sky. Streets around the city center were also empty, with many who remained spending the night in subway stations and underground garages, seeking safe haven. One Kyiv resident who gave her name as Olga said she had her young son Vadim, a kindergartener, sleeping in the bathroom. ""We are not going to the shelter, it does not guarantee 100% safety, and it can affect the psychology of a child. At home, he sleeps well, eats and thinks it's all fun,"" she said. An unknown number of Kyiv's residents had already left the capital by Friday, leaving quiet the roads heading west of the capital that had been busy on Thursday. Refugees have been pouring into neighboring European countries in recent days, with international leaders warning of a humanitarian crisis. Kelly Clements, the deputy high commissioner of the UN's refugee agency, told CNN more than 120,000 Ukrainians have fled Ukraine while 850,000 are internally displaced. Up to 4 million Ukrainians could flee if things continued to deteriorate",17,4.254424151432766,1.547001706836437,2.707422444596329,29
2022-02-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/europe/ukraine-russia-videos-civilians-intl-cmd/index.html,Russia says it's not hitting Ukraine's civilian infrastructure. Evidence suggests otherwise,"On Friday, Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov sought to reassure the world about civilian casualties on day two of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine,"" he said during a heated press conference, telling CNN that there were ""no strikes on civilian infrastructure."" However, reports about apartment buildings and kindergartens being shelled, civilians being killed, and rockets being found in residential streets have been trickling in since the beginning of the offensive. Social media videos, photos and satellite images analyzed and geolocated by CNN confirm that on several occasions densely populated areas have been hit by Russian forces. CNN is reaching out to the Russian government for comment. Amnesty International, in a press release on Friday, accused Russian forces of ""indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and strikes on protected objects such as hospitals,"" citing three examples, including an attack on Thursday near a hospital building in Vuhledar, in the eastern Donetsk region. That attack killed four civilians and wounded ten more, Amnesty reported. Here are some examples CNN found. Kindergarten in Okhtyrka, orphanage in Vorzel A kindergarten in Okhtyrka, in the north-eastern region of Sumy, was hit by shelling on Friday, according to several public officials. The mayor Pavel Kuzmenko, claimed the shelling was carried out by a Russian Uragan multiple launch rocket system, injuring several children. News of the alleged attack on Sonechko kindergarten was confirmed by the Head of the Sumy Regional Military Administration Dmytro Zhivitsky who said this was the third shelling in Okhtyrka on Friday. A video circulating on social media which CNN geolocated to the kindergarten in Okhtyrka shows injured people covered in blood on the ground in front of the entrance. In the aftermath of the alleged attack, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused the Russian Federation of ""war crimes."" ""Today's Russian attacks on a kindergarten and an orphanage are war crimes and violations of the Rome Statute,"" Kuleba tweeted. ""Together with the General Prosecutor's Office we are collecting this and other facts, which we will immediately send to the Hague. Responsibility is inevitable,"" he added. The orphanage was also mentioned by Lyudmila Denisova, the ombudsman of the Verkhovna Rada for Human Rights. ""As a result of heavy armor shelling of an orphanage in the town of Vorzel in the Kyiv region, 51 children are currently at risk of life and health, 3 of whom have severe health problems and 15 infants. Two buildings of the institution were damaged,"" she said. Rockets in Bucha and Kharkiv A video appeared on Facebook on Friday showing a projectile hitting the tarmac on a residential road. The user posting it then attached a photo of a remnant in hand with the words ""the fragment is on our doorstep."" CNN geolocated the video to a residential address in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv. Experts and open source analysts are debating whether the rocket contained a cluster munition based on the footage. Mark Hiznay, associate director of the arms division at Human Rights Watch told CNN the projectile is a cluster munition. Upon landing, the munition ""will impact a wide area,"" Hiznay explained and ""send out 9mm bullets all over the place. Pretty nasty."" Another explosive also landed in a residential area in Kharkiv, a city in northeast Ukraine. One image circulating on social media showed a large projectile that had ploughed through a pedestrian crossing. CNN geolocated the image to Kharkiv. Hiznay identified the weapon as a motor for a Smerch rocket and said it was likely no longer dangerous. Chuhuiv apartment building An apartment block in the eastern city of Chuhuiv, outside Kharkiv, was damaged in an attack on Thursday that Ukrainian officials attributed to Russian forces. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry listed Chuhuiv as one of the targets of the intensive shelling and strikes on the first day of the Russian offensive. Maxar released new imagery of a nearby airport that was the likely target of the attack. In the images, it is possible to see damage to fuel storage areas and other airport infrastructure. News agencies such as Agence France-Presse and Anadolu released images that showed a resident of the Chuhuiv apartment building crying among the wreckage of the strike, an old woman wrapped in a blanket sitting outside and firefighters attending a fire inside the building. At least one victim could be seen lying on the ground. Photos also showed a single large crater in the ground which hints at the use of a single missile or rocket for the attack, Amnesty said. CNN has geolocated the site of the attack.",17,1.934221315483913,1.4228586899363564,0.5113626255475565,10
2022-02-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-friday-intl-hnk/index.html,Battle for Ukrainian capital underway as explosions seen and heard in Kyiv,"Explosions have been seen and heard in parts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as the fight by Ukrainian forces to hold back a Russian advance on the capital intensifies in the early hours of Saturday morning, amid warnings the city could fall within days and as officials handed out weapons to reservists. ""This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a late-night video message Friday. ""This night we have to stand ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now."" Earlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area. CNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well -- as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv. ""Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,"" the armed forces said. Russian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But ""Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,"" he said. Russia's military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a ""successful landing operation"" to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv's outskirts. Zelensky's comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, ""We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine."" Before dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later. ""Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,"" Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire. LIVE UPDATES ON INVASION A tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: ""Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier."" CNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition -- apparently heading towards Obolon. Meanwhile, 92 people working at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world's worst-ever nuclear disaster, have been taken hostage, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said Friday. Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities. As Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence. However, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made ""limited progress"" Friday in its attack. ""Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,"" the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted. A senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have ""about a third of their combat power"" in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country's borders right now, but ""that does not mean that they will not commit more."" The Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million. For now, Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that ""enemy sabotage groups"" had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" he said. ""Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,"" he said. ""Such attacks on our capital haven't occurred since 1941."" In an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were ""showing their true heroism"" but that they were defending their country ""alone."" The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are ""not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,"" he said. A few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. ""There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let's sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people's deaths,"" he said, speaking in Russian. Shortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported. ""As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,"" Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern ""neutral status,"" he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact. Zelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees. ""Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,"" Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called ""claims that we have refused to negotiate."" Meanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine's armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday. ""Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,"" Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. ""Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people."" Putin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a ""Nazi"" or ""fascist"" regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish. Asked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow's plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: ""Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine."" In an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being ""simply crazy"" in wanting to ""come here to kill Ukrainians"" -- and vowed they would resist. ""We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,"" he said. Homes damaged The advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions -- and questions about Putin's wider ambitions for the country and its capital. It's unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power. Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured. Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet. Separately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city. As they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way. Outside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south. A CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back. Low-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city. A Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a ""counter-offensive"" was underway in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims. Makeshift bunkers Officials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government. Those fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he's ""convinced"" Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government. If that happens, Blinken said he believes ""Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses -- and potentially worse -- on the Ukrainian people."" The fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.

The sources said that the initial US assessment from before the invasion -- which anticipated that the Ukrainian capital would be overrun within one to four days of a Russian attack -- remains the current expectation. Russian forces have moved to within 20 miles of Kyiv, senior administration officials told lawmakers on Capitol Hill Thursday night. Officials believe Russia has been facing stiffer resistance from Ukrainian forces than it anticipated, according to the sources. But the officials in that briefing to Capitol Hill declined to say whether they believed Kyiv would fall. Western intelligence officials assess that Russia's plan is to topple the government in Kyiv and install a Russia-friendly proxy government, but they don't yet know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will seek to occupy and hold Ukrainian territory afterwards, one of the sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN. Ukrainian officials have vowed to resist any occupation. Ukrainians in Kyiv huddled in air raid shelters Friday morning as a battle for the city raged overhead and Ukrainian forces sought to hold back rapidly advancing Russian troops by blowing up a key bridge.

2022-02-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/europe/russia-ukraine-military-comparison-intl/index.html,Ukraine and Russia's militaries are David and Goliath. Here's how they compare,"Heavily armed Russian troops are pushing rapidly towards Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, and US officials are warning the city could fall within days. The military capabilities of these two nations are so imbalanced that Ukraine's defiant president, Volodymyr Zelensky, implored his Western allies overnight to do more than impose sanctions to get Russian troops off Ukrainian soil. Here's how the two country's military capabilities stack up. Defense spending Just a look at the amount of money the two nations spend on defense gives an indication of the gap between the two. Ukraine spent $4.7 billion in 2021, just over a tenth of nuclear-armed Russia's $45.8 billion, according to ""The Military Balance"" report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), published last week. While the Russian government launched a drive in 2008 to modernize its military, after a brief war with Georgia laid bare equipment shortfalls, Ukraine's weapons are still largely from the Soviet era. In its ambitions to join NATO, however, Ukraine has reorganized the structure of its armed forces, and has plans to re-equip its air force with Western combat aircraft by the mid-2030s. It also plans to improve its naval capability. Manpower Where Russia has 900,000 active personnel in its armed forces, and 2 million in reserve, Ukraine has 196,000 and 900,000 reservists. Ukraine on Wednesday began conscripting reservists aged 18-60, according to IISS. In land forces alone, Russia has a twofold advantage, with 280,000 troops to Ukraine's 125,600. And its air force is nearly five times as strong, with 165,00 to Ukraine's 35,000. But in terms of how many troops are in this particular operation, Yohann Michel, a research analyst who worked on the IISS report, said Russia had an estimated 200,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. ""That's including around 60 battle groups. The situation is evolving rapidly and that number could change, but it's very large, and that's important. It's one of the largest in eastern Europe that we've seen in years -- in my lifetime,"" Michel told CNN. ""Ukrainian numbers are more difficult because everything they have is now mobilized and they have called in reservists."" Weaponry and vehicles There is a lot to compare here -- attack aircraft, armored vehicles, surface-to-air missiles -- but in general, Russia simply has more of everything. Russia has more than 15,857 armored fighting vehicles, for example, to Ukraine's 3,309. It has more than 10 times the aircraft -- 1,391 to Ukraine's 128, and 821 helicopters to Ukraine's 55, if you include Navy aircraft. And where Russia has 49 submarines, Ukraine has none, according to IISS. ""There are big difference between the two forces -- Russia has a much more capable air domain, its air defenses are stronger,"" Michel said. ""There is a huge difference on helicopters and planes available at every level -- from transport aircraft to fighter aircraft to attack helicopters."" Combat will Ukrainian forces have, however, launched some successful counterattacks. Michel notes that the sheer combat will among Ukrainian troops to fight has been the armed forces' greatest strength. ""I'm really surprised at what I'm seeing. The fact that Ukrainian fighter jets are still flying, they actually took off is impressive."" If Russia takes the capital soon, it will be difficult for Ukraine to fight back. But if it is unsuccessful, the conflict could become protracted. And that's the scenario where Ukraine's will may prove a powerful weapon, Michel said. Modernization But with fighting going on across the country, the number and quality of armory is a major factor. Nick Reynolds, a Research Analyst for Land Warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, said that Ukraine's air force was now largely knocked out. ""There have been serious issues with modernization due to Ukraine's economic problems since 2014, so the military lacks modern air defense and artillery, particularly counter-battery artillery radar and other surveillance equipment to detect enemy artillery and at least stand some chance of suppressing it with their own,"" Reynolds told CNN. ""These capabilities are critical for Ukraine's army to be able to maneuver and resupply itself.""",14,3.226164243013131,1.6923011728585369,1.5338630701545943,12

Russian forces appeared to be encircling the city and looked poised to invade, Ukraine's deputy interior minister told CNN. Officials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government. In a video statement late Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky said he believes ""enemy sabotage groups"" had entered Kyiv and that he was their No. 1 target. His family, he said, was the second target. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" he said, adding he was staying in the government quarter. Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact, but has declared state of emergency that will begin Friday. In an emotional speech Thursday afternoon, Zelensky called on world leaders for support, warning that if Ukraine doesn't get help now, ""war will come knocking at your door tomorrow."" According to preliminary figures, 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed since the invasion began early Thursday, Zelensky said, with another 316 soldiers wounded. In a declaration signed late Thursday, Zelensky ordered a general military mobilization ""in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations."" At the same time, the country barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service. Western leaders were united in their swift and strong condemnation of Russia's military action. US President Joe Biden said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""committed an assault on the very principles that uphold the global peace."" ""Now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin allies are really all about,"" Biden said Biden announced a raft of new sanctions to punish Moscow, some of which limit Russia's ability to do business using important global currencies such as the dollar and the euro and target Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets. ""Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,"" said Biden. Speaking in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a ""brutal act of war"" and said it put ""countless innocent lives"" at risk. ""Peace on our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on the scale and of the type we thought belonged to history,"" he said. ""NATO allies condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. It is a blatant violation of international law, an act of aggression against a sovereign independent and peaceful country."" NATO will increase land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank, the security alliance said in a statement. Russians give their rationale for invasion Putin had kept the international community on a knife's edge for months, as the world watched and waited to see what exactly the Kremlin planned to do with the estimated 150,000 troops it deployed on Ukraine's borders. After repeatedly denying any plans to invade Ukraine, Putin said in a televised address early Thursday that Russia would be conducting a military operation in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which contains Donetsk and Luhansk, the separatist-held regions that Moscow recognized as independent on Monday -- in violation of international law. Putin said earlier this week he was ordering troops to the breakaway enclaves to act as ""peacekeepers."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told foreign journalists that the ""demilitarization and denazification"" of Ukraine are among the objectives of Russia's military action in the country. ""Ideally, Ukraine should be liberated, cleansed of Nazis, of pro-Nazi people and ideology,"" Peskov said, though he refused to say if that meant regime change in Kyiv. The Russian claim of a need to ""denazify"" Ukraine is one Putin has touted repeatedly over the years and is baseless. Zelensky, the Ukrainian President, is Jewish. The Russian strongman urged Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home, saying all responsibility for possible bloodshed would be entirely on the conscience of the Ukrainian government. ""Our plans are not to occupy Ukraine, we do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,"" he said, but threatened ""those who may be tempted to intervene"" on Ukraine's behalf. ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never experienced in your history,"" he said. Invasion launched before dawn The first blasts were heard at around 5 a.m. local time Thursday, and it quickly became clear that Moscow's military assault was not limited to eastern Ukraine. CNN teams on the ground heard explosions in and near multiple Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv; the second-largest city, Kharkiv; Odessa; and distant firing from Zaporizhzhiya. Ukrainian officials said on social media that Russia was staging attacks far and wide, shelling control centers such as airfields and military headquarters in Kyiv and Kharkiv. The Russian military has, according to a senior US defense official, been targeting ""military and air defense"" targets, meaning ""barracks, ammunition warehouses, nearly 10 airfields,"" the official said. Images released by Zelensky's office showed large explosions to the east of Kyiv with huge columns of smoke rising into the air. At least seven people were killed and 17 were wounded in a missile attack on a military area northeast of the capital, Ukrainian authorities said. Zelensky said Ukrainian forces were doing ""exceptionally"" in the Donbas region, and while Russian troops were slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region in Ukraine's north, Ukrainian defenses were holding elsewhere. Russian forces did seize the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the scene of Europe's worst nuclear disaster. Ukraine's borders were reportedly under attack from Russian forces to the north in Belarus and the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. The Russian military claimed Ukraine's border service ""did not provide any resistance"" and claimed to have ""suppressed"" Ukraine's air defenses. CNN was not able to immediately verify either of those claims. Three military facilities in the western Lviv region were attacked, according to the regional governor. Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN that Ukrainian troops had retreated from ""fierce fighting"" with Russian forces for control of the strategic Antonov air base on the outskirts of the Kyiv but were staging a counterattack. Earlier Thursday, large numbers of helicopters dropped Russian troops at the air base to secure it, he said. A CNN team spoke with Russian airborne troops on the perimeter of the air base, only about 20 miles from the heart of the capital, and heard exchanges of fire with Ukrainian forces. Civilians hide in subway stations amid fighting The violence near the capital forced families to crowd into subway stations, as city authorities issued an air raid warning and urged residents to seek shelter underground. Across the country, Ukraine's subway stations are doubling as bomb shelters, as the assault continues and fears of strikes grow. Heavy traffic could be seen clogging roads heading west out of the capital as dawn broke, while further east, near the Russian border, the mayor of Kharkiv urged citizens not to leave their homes. Ukrainians have largely remained divided about the possibility of a Russian invasion, hoping that the military buildup was just the latest in Moscow's mind games. After months of ratcheting up tensions, the wide-scale military assault still came as a shock -- especially in Kyiv, where residents had, until Wednesday, continued to go about their daily lives as foreign governments withdrew their diplomatic staff from the capital. ""You wake up at 5 a.m. to a totally new reality, and you find out the world is no longer the safe place you imagined,"" one woman in Kharkiv told CNN. ""I can't believe it's happening, really."" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced a curfew from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. local time, and the capital went dark late Thursday as residents left the streets deserted and either switched off their lights or drew their curtains. While major details about the incursion -- including total casualties -- remain shrouded in the fog of war, UK military intelligence earlier said more than 80 strikes had been carried out against Ukrainian targets, while a senior US defense official said the Russians had launched more than 160 missiles. Russia also deployed 75 fixed-wing heavy and medium bombers in the initial attack and initiated ""some ground incursions"" into Ukraine from Belarus, northwest of Kyiv, the US official added. The Russian military released a statement Thursday claiming it was not targeting Ukrainian cities, saying ""the civilian population is not at risk."" Still, many Ukrainians chose to leave the capital, while others hunkered down in shelters.",17,2.53075128347294,0.4719159455725273,2.0588353379004127,10
2022-02-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/europe/russia-ukraine-putin-military-operation-donbas-intl-hnk/index.html,Russia launches military attack on Ukraine with reports of explosions and troops crossing border,"Russian forces have begun an attack on Ukraine, with reports of troops crossing the border to the north and south, explosions in multiple cities including the capital Kyiv and warnings from Russian President Vladimir Putin of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms. The offensive that Russia called a ""special military operation"" came as world leaders attempted to avert catastrophe with a meeting of the United Nations Security Council amid warnings that a possible invasion could start the biggest war in Europe since 1945. The first blasts were heard at around 5 a.m. Thursday, prompting immediate condemnation from the United States and its allies, which have threatened to enact ""full scale"" sanctions in response to Russian military aggression. As air raid sirens rang out across Kyiv early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky moved to enact martial law and government ministers accused Moscow of launching a ""full scale invasion."" As dawn broke, heavy traffic could be seen clogging roads heading west out of the city, while further east, near the Russian border, the mayor of Kharkiv urged citizens not to leave their homes. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted on his official page that ""peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strike"" and called the situation ""a war of aggression."" And an adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Minister, Anton Gerashchenko, told journalists Russia's ""invasion has begun"" with ""missile strikes on Kyiv."" CNN witnessed, through a livestream video, troops atop a column of military vehicles entering Ukraine from a border crossing with Belarus. The livestream video was taken at the Senkivka, Ukraine crossing with Veselovka, Belarus. The column was seen entering Ukraine at about 6:48 a.m. local time. In recent weeks, Russia has amassed a significant number of troops, vehicles and tanks in Belarus near the border with Ukraine. During that time, the two countries have held joint military exercises across the countries, and near the Belarus-Ukrainian border. CNN teams in Russia and Ukraine also heard blasts from several parts of Ukraine, including near the capital Kyiv and the port city of Odessa, and images released by the office of President Zelensky showed large explosions to the east of the capital Kyiv with huge columns of smoke rising into the air. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said five Russian aircraft and a helicopter were shot down early Thursday, claims Russia denied via state news agency TASS. Hours before, Putin announced a military operation in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which contains the separatist-held regions of Donetsk and Luhansk which Moscow recognized as independent on Monday -- in violation of international law. In the address, broadcast live on Russian national television, Putin urged Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home, saying all responsibility for possible bloodshed would be entirely on the conscience of the Ukrainian government. ""Our plans are not to occupy Ukraine, we do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,"" he said, but threatened ""those who may be tempted to intervene"" on Ukraine's behalf. ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never experienced in your history,"" he said. Before the announcement of military action, Zelensky appealed for peace but vowed the country would defend itself. ""If we are attacked militarily, if they try to take away our freedom, our lives, our children's lives, we will defend ourselves,"" the Ukrainian President said, in a speech in Russian and directed at Russian citizens.""When you attack, you will see our faces and not our spines, our faces."" In a second video message posted to his official Facebook page Thursday, Zelensky said Russia ""began an attack on Ukraine today"" and that Ukrainian forces had ""already taken on the first blow of the enemy and are resisting."" ""Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we've been building, everything we are living for,"" he said. US President Joe Biden issued a statement saying Russia had launched ""an unprovoked and unjustified attack"" on the Ukrainian people. ""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,"" he said. ""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable."" ""These are among the darkest hours for Europe since the end of World War II. A major nuclear power has attacked a neighbor country and is threatening reprisals of any other states that may come to rescue,"" said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in Brussels. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to ""weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernize"" following its ""barbaric attack"" against Ukraine. ""We will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets,"" she said. Russian stocks plunged Thursday after trading resumed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. The Russian ruble also crashed to an all-time low against the dollar and the euro. What's happening on the ground Ukraine's borders were reportedly under attack from Russian forces to the north in Belarus and the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Russian troops had attacked border units, patrol border and checkpoints with ""artillery, heavy equipment and small arms,"" the border service said. The Russian military claimed Ukraine's border service ""did not provide any resistance"" and claimed to have ""suppressed"" Ukraine's air defenses. CNN was not able to immediately verify either of those claims. CNN teams on the ground heard explosions in and near multiple Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, the second largest city Kharkiv, Odessa, and distant firing from Zaporizhzhiya. Ukraine Interior Minister adviser Gerashchenko tweeted that troops had landed in the southern city of Odessa and were crossing the border in Kharkiv, located in the country's northeast. In a post on his Facebook page, he also said control centers such as airfields and military headquarters were being hit by shelling in Kyiv and Kharkiv, and that there was artillery fire along the border. The Russian military released a statement Thursday claiming it was not targeting Ukrainian cities, saying ""the civilian population is not at risk."" ""The Russian Armed Forces are not launching any missile or artillery strikes on the cities of Ukraine. High-precision weapons destroy military infrastructure: military airfields, aviation, air defense facilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"" the statement read. But despite the Russian military's claims that civilians wouldn't be targeted, many chose to leave the capital. Kyiv residents had previously been told to stay at home and pack a bag with necessities, in case they needed to leave abruptly. Witnesses told CNN that subway stations had become improvised bunkers and were full of people, with supplies organized in groups. Across the city, red arrows painted on walls indicate the locations of the nearest bomb shelters. The city first put them up after the war broke out in the east of the country in 2014, but they were recently repainted. Before Putin's address, Russia issued a notice banning civil aircraft from flight routes bordering northeastern Ukraine. Separately, Ukrainian aviation authorities issued a notice restricting Ukrainian airspace in the regions around Kyiv, Dnipro, Lviv, Odessa and Simferopol. European aviation regulators warned civilian aircraft were at ""high risk"" near the Ukrainian border. ""Air operators are reminded that this is now an active conflict zone,"" said the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, known as EASA. In an apparent escalation in cyberattacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, several key Ukrainian websites were down as of 3 a.m local time on Thursday (8 p.m. ET Wednesday), including those of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, Interior Ministry, the Security Service in Ukraine, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Infrastructure, and the Ministry of Justice. Military operation comes as UN Security Council meets The launch of the military operation came as members of the UN Security Council met in New York to call for a peaceful resolution to the impending crisis. In ordering troops to enter Ukraine, Putin had ""delivered a message of war,"" said US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield. ""This is a grave emergency. The council will need to act,"" she said. ""We will put a resolution on the table tomorrow."" Her Ukrainian counterpart Sergiy Kyslytsya begged the Security Council to help stop a war, saying it was too late to speak about de-escalation. ""It is the responsibility of this body to stop the war,"" Kyslytsya said. ""So I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war,"" he added, looking around the room. Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said the aim of Russia's military operation in Donbas was to protect locals who have been ""suffering genocide"" at the hands of the Ukrainian government for over eight years. ""The route of today's crisis around Ukraine is the actions of Ukraine itself, who for many years were sabotaging its obligations under the Minsk package of measures,"" said Nebenzya.",17,0.34147315538845774,3.512593257564216,-3.1711201021757582,29
2022-02-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-2-cmd-intl/index.html,What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained,"Russia's multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding. After months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia's side of the border, Ukraine's 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations. Russia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep. Frenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country. The escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia's attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow. So how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know. How did Russia invade Ukraine? Several areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a ""special military operation"" and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms. The move came after months of speculation about what Moscow's intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials. In late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow's closest international ally. Some of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv. Missile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania. Russia's larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow's attempts. That resistance has been ""stiffer than expected"" and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated. But US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance. The US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin's move. NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a ""grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security."" And a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia's economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked. The coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation. The territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia's intended creep into Ukraine. What set the stage for the conflict? Ukraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future -- crossing a red line for Russia. Putin has seen NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act"" -- a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine's aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia. In interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe. In early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. In the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create ""a pretext for an invasion."" What does Putin want? In a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people,"" and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia's orbit through a ""forced change of identity."" That type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin's emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine's own sovereignty. But Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West's ""puppet."" In fact, Putin's efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance. In December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe -- proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters. Putin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. ""It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,"" he said at his annual news conference late last year. ""Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep."" High-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe's leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine's east -- known as the Normandy Format talks -- could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis. In a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a ""genocide"" against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress -- echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea. But less than a week later, after Russia's upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements ""no longer exist,"" adding: ""What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?"" The agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 -- which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine -- have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved. Moscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and -- although unclear in what sequence -- would also restore the Ukrainian government's control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics. Putin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. ""Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,"" Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: ""We are not his."" How has Ukraine responded?

2022-02-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-visual-explainer-maps/index.html,Six maps explaining the Ukraine-Russia conflict,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday began a military operation in Ukraine after weeks of warnings by Western powers that such an attack was imminent. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine was also precipitated by years of rising tensions. Below are six maps that help illustrate the events that led to this moment. NATO since the Cold War Since the end of the Cold War, more countries have been joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, pushing the bloc eastward. In 2008, NATO declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine -- a former cornerstone of the Soviet Union -- some day in the distant future. But Russia considered that crossing a red line. This map shows NATO's expansion eastward in Europe. Many countries in western Europe joined prior to 1991 and the end of the Cold War, while those to the east -- including the former Soviet Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- joined in the years since. Putin has indicated he sees NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act."" He has emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically, and Russia asked amid recent tensions for guarantees the European and North American defense alliance wouldn't expand further east. The United States and NATO have resisted. The alliance's ""open door policy"" states that any European country ready and willing to undertake the commitments and obligations of membership is welcome to apply for membership. And since the end of the Cold War, more than a dozen countries from the former Eastern bloc have joined. Annexing part of Ukraine In early 2014, mass protests in the Ukrainian capital forced out a Russian-backed president after he refused to sign a historic political and trade agreement with the European Union. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, highlighted in red along the Black Sea's northern coast in the map below, and fomenting a separatist rebellion that seized control of part of the Donbas region along Ukraine's southeastern border with Russia. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Inflamed tensions In the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the US State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create ""a pretext for an invasion."" Those efforts have also manifested themselves on the ground, as seen in this map, which illustrates the buildup of Russia's military presence around Ukraine in the past year. Russia has amassed more than 150,000 troops, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep. As the situation on Ukraine's border has intensified, NATO has raised the readiness of its rapid response force, while member countries put troops on standby and deployed battalions, planes and ships to defend member states in the region. The buildup of these resources, seen in this map, includes thousands of US troops deployed in Poland. Russian invasion On February 21, Putin said he officially recognized the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), highlighted in the map below in red, in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there on the pretext of protecting the local population. The territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia's intended creep into Ukraine. Hours before dawn on Thursday, February 24, Russia's assault on Ukraine finally began with a series of missile attacks and the use of long-range artillery. This map shows the locations of reported attacks and explosions as of Thursday night, including in and around major cities such as the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, Kharkiv in the east and Odessa in the south, among others.

2022-02-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-attack-timeline-intl/index.html,Here's what we know about how Russia's invasion of Ukraine unfolded,"Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, sending troops into the ex-Soviet nation from three fronts and firing missiles on several locations near the capital, Kyiv, in a broad attack that has drawn deep condemnation from world leaders. At dawn, troops and armor crossed into eastern Ukraine from the Russian border, as well as from Belarus in the north and from Russia-annexed Crimea to the south. Here's how it unfolded. Stirrings in Crimea 3:59 a.m. (8:59 p.m. ET, Wednesday): Livestream video from a border crossing station between Crimea -- which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- and parts of southern Ukraine viewed by CNN showed what may have been the first signs of the Russian invasion. In the video, a guard at the Kalanchak crossing is seen reacting to something heading towards the Ukrainian border. The guard begins moving back towards the gate, and soon another guard comes into frame. About 25 seconds later, people who had just walked across to Crimea, are seen -- suitcases in tow -- running back across the border. The lights suddenly go out at the station, and the camera switches to black and white, recording in infrared. 4:08 a.m.: An individual dressed in camouflage is seen carrying a flashlight coming around one of the border guard stations. Three minutes later, three more individuals in camouflage are seen walking around the border crossing. Minutes later, the the camera cuts out. Very soon after, another webcam at the Chongar border crossing -- the only other active border crossing station from Crimea -- shows lights suddenly turning off, and, minutes later, the camera turns off as well. Putin announces 'operation' 4:50 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin made a speech, saying he had decided ""to conduct a special military operation ... to protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years,"" repeating a baseless claim about Ukraine's Russian-separatist-backed Donbas region. He denied, however, that Russia was planning to occupy Ukrainian territories. ""We are not going to impose anything on anyone by force."" He went on to warn: ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history."" Strikes begin 5.07 a.m.: Russian forces launched a series of missile attacks against locations near Kyiv, as well as the use of long-range artillery against the northeastern city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border. Before daylight: The strikes quickly spread across central and eastern Ukraine, as Russian forces attacked the country from three sides. People in the cities of Odessa, Dnipro, Mariupol and Kramatorsk reported huge blasts. Several detonations to the east of Kyiv let off massive plumes of gray smoke rising into the night sky. One of the chief targets was the main international airport at Boryspil, which is pummeled by missiles. Video showed a cruise missile hitting a military installation at the airport at Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine. Airports were also hit in Kharkiv, Ozerne, Kulbakino, Chuhuiv, Kramatorsk and Chornobaivka. Most of the targets were military bases, but there was clearly substantial damage in and around several cities. In Kharkiv, video emerged of an apartment block that had been damaged by a missile or long-range artillery. Another video showed a rocket embedded in a road. The State Emergency Service reported that six people were trapped in rubble in Nizhyn. Ukraine's interior ministry said ballistic missiles had been used as part of the offensive, while jets were heard over the central city of Zaporizhzhye. The Russians used a wide array of weaponry in their assault, including attack aircraft and helicopters, tanks, long range artillery and missiles. 6.48 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to Putin with a minute-long speech of his own, saying he had spoken to US President Joe Biden and that the US was rallying international support for Ukraine. ""The West is with us,"" he said, and announced martial law across the country. At the same time, a livestream video seen by CNN showed troops atop a column of military vehicles entering Ukraine from a border crossing with Belarus. The livestream video was taken at the Senkivka, Urkaine crossing with Veselovka, Belarus. Dawn breaks 7 a.m.: After dawn, air raid sirens sounded across Kyiv and at around 7:45 a.m., sirens go off in the western city of Lviv. A short time later, a single, unidentifiable plane roared above the capital. 8.00 a.m.: Ukraine claimed it had shot down five Russian aircraft and a helicopter. Russia denied losing any aircraft. As the day began in Kyiv, streams of vehicles could be seen crossing the North Bridge, heading west, away from the focus of the Russian assault. Other people in the capital sought shelter in subway stations. Across the country, long lines formed at gas stations and cash machines. A few people gathered in the streets of Kharkiv to pray. An eyewitness who saw and heard the latest strike in the town of Brovary on the outskirts of Kyiv described the situation as ""terrifying."" 11.28 a.m: Ukrainian leader Zelensky made a televised address, in which he said Russia has attacked Ukraine in a ""cunning way,"" comparing him to Hitler in World War II. He called on ""everyone who is able"" to join the military and called on veterans to come forward. ""From today our countries are on opposing sides of world history. Russia is on the side of evil, but it depends on the Russian people,"" he said. ""The people of Russia will have to choose which path each of them takes. Everyone in Russia who has not lost their honor, they have time to come out and protest this war."" 12:37 p.m.: More than 40 soldiers and about 10 civilians had been killed, Ukrainian authorities said. 12:45 p.m.: CNN teams in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and Mariupol heard more strikes, though they appear to be less severe than explosions reported earlier. 12:55 p.m.: Around five blasts were heard by a CNN team in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Around 2 p.m.: A K-52 ""Alligator"" Russian helicopter was shot down in the Kyiv region, near Mezhyhirya, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry confirmed. All timings are in local Ukrainian time and are estimates.",17,3.3071159577788594,5.025881703775909,-1.7187657459970493,10

""We can confirm that the United States informed the Russian Embassy that we are expelling its Minister Counselor,"" a State Department spokesperson said, noting that the deputy chief of mission at the Russian Embassy had ""previously departed as part of a normal rotation,"" so the Minister Counselor ""is the next most senior official at the Russian Embassy."" ""We are taking these actions as a direct response to the unprovoked Russian expulsion of our Deputy Chief of Mission, who was given two weeks to depart, despite the fact that he had not completed his three-year tour,"" the spokesperson said. Russia was notified of the decision on Wednesday, and the diplomat has been given a few weeks to leave the US, the official said. The official said the decision was not related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine which took place after Moscow was notified of the expulsion. US Deputy Chief of Mission in Moscow Bart Gorman was expelled by Russia earlier this year and given two weeks to depart the country, according to a senior US State Department official. Gorman left Russia in February and has returned to the United States, the official said. ""We have been crystal clear with the Russians on where we stand -- parity and fairness,"" the spokesperson said.

2022-02-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/russia-sanctions-fbi-cyber-threats-ransomware/index.html,US officials tell businesses to watch for potential ransomware attacks after Biden announces Russia sanctions,"Minutes after President Joe Biden announced new sanctions on Russian banks and elites on Tuesday, a senior FBI cyber official asked US businesses and local governments to be mindful of the potential for ransomware attacks as the crisis between the Kremlin and Ukraine deepens. Russia is a ""permissive operating environment"" for cybercriminals -- one that ""is not going to get any smaller"" as Russia's confrontation with the West over Ukraine continues and further sanctions are announced, the FBI's David Ring said on a phone briefing with private executives and state and local officials, according to two people who were on the call. Ring asked state and local officials and business executives to consider how ransomware attacks could disrupt the provision of critical services, the people on the call said. US officials continue to say there are ""no specific, credible"" threats to the US homeland tied to tensions with Russia over Ukraine, but they are preaching vigilance. The willingness of Russian-speaking cybercriminals to disrupt US critical infrastructure has been a US concern for years, but it came to a head last year when a ransomware attack forced major fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline to shut down for days. The phone call was one in a series of briefings that FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials have had for US companies and local governments in the last two months in light of US tensions with Russia over Ukraine. It had been scheduled before it was clear that Biden would address Russia's latest moves in Ukraine on Tuesday. The US President announced the ""first tranche"" of sanctions against Russian entities for Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to recognize two breakaway regions in Ukraine and send troops there. The US could also see ""a possible increase in cyber threat activity"" from Russian state-backed hackers as a result of those sanctions, Ring said, according to the people on the call. ""DHS has been engaging in an outreach campaign to ensure that public and private sector partners are aware of evolving cybersecurity risks and taking steps to increase their cybersecurity preparedness,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. CNN has requested comment from the FBI. The extortion of Colonial Pipeline had underscored for Biden administration officials the economic and national security threat posed by ransomware. The incident triggered long lines at gas stations in multiple US states and prompted Biden to call on Putin to rein in cybercriminals operating from Russian soil. While ransomware attacks on US organizations by Russian-speaking hackers have continued, Russian authorities have dangled the prospect of cracking down on some groups in recent months, as the standoff over Ukraine brewed. US officials said last month that they believe Russia has detained the person responsible for the Colonial Pipeline hack, but any cooperation between the two governments on cybercrime could be elusive if relations further deteriorate over Ukraine, according to some analysts. After the cyberattacks on Ukrainian government and banking websites last week that the Biden administration blamed on Russia's military intelligence directorate, US officials continue to see Russian cyber operations as likely playing a role in any further military invasion. In the event of a larger conflict between Russia and Ukraine, US officials are concerned that transportation networks and broadcast media in Ukraine could be shut down by kinetic or cyberattacks, Matthew Hackner, an official in DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis, said on Tuesday's phone briefing, according to people on the call.",3,6.217284797258171,0.3897021985025242,5.827582598755646,23
2022-02-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/europe/ukraine-government-commercial-organizations-data-wiping-hack/index.html,Key Ukrainian government websites hit by series of cyberattacks,"Key Ukrainian government websites were down early Thursday morning local time following a day in which Ukrainian agencies dealt with multiple cyberattacks and as concerns mounted over Russian troop movements into Ukraine's separatist regions. The websites of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, and those of the ministries of foreign affairs, infrastructure, education and others, were experiencing disruptions. In a separate and potentially more serious hacking incident hours earlier, a data-wiping tool was found on hundreds of computers in Ukraine, according to cybersecurity researchers, raising concerns that a destructive cyberattack was unfolding amid Russia's military escalation. Taken together, the incidents represented an apparent escalation in cyberattacks on Ukrainian infrastructure as the US and its allies warned of an imminent Russian invasion in Ukraine and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and elites. In televised remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced military action in Ukraine's Donbas region Thursday morning, urging Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home. ""We are aware of multiple commercial and government organizations in Ukraine impacted by the destructive malware today,"" Charles Carmakal, senior vice president and chief technology officer for cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told CNN. The hacking incidents came as United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres made an eleventh-hour appeal to Russia to curtail military action. ""If indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart: President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine,"" Guterres told an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Wednesday night in New York. ""Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died."" US officials have warned that Russia will very likely use cyber operations in conjunction with military action in Ukraine. President Joe Biden said last month the US could respond with cyberoperations of its own if Russia conducts additional cyberattacks in Ukraine. The website disruptions early Thursday in Ukraine followed news Wednesday afternoon of a cyberattack that temporarily knocked offline the websites of the Ukrainian parliament, Security Service and Cabinet of Ministers. It wasn't immediately clear who was responsible for the destructive hacking incident, or the website disruptions early Thursday morning. The Ukrainian government did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine said the cyberattacks on websites reported earlier Wednesday were ""a continuation"" of cyberattacks that hit Ukrainian government websites on February 15. The White House blamed Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, for those hacks, which are known as distribute denial of service (DDoS) attacks because they overwhelm computer servers with phony traffic and knock websites offline. Russia's embassy in Washington denied the accusation. Of all the cyber incidents, though, the destructive data-wiping tool -- known as ""wiper"" malware -- had the potential to be the most impactful. Wiper malware typically deletes data from computers and renders them inoperable. That has the potential to hobble organizations trying to stay online in a conflict. The hack hit at least one Ukrainian financial institution and two Ukrainian government contractors, one with a presence in Latvia and the other with a presence in Lithuania, Vikram Thakur, technical director at Broadcom's cybersecurity unit Symantec, told CNN. The malicious code affected ""large organizations"" in Ukraine, according to cybersecurity firm ESET, which has multiple clients in the country. The hacking tool appears to have been created two months ago, but ""was deployed only today and we have seen it only in Ukraine,"" said Jean-Ian Boutin, head of threat research ESET. In the event of a larger conflict between Russia and Ukraine, US officials are concerned that transportation networks and broadcast media in Ukraine could be shut down by kinetic or cyberattacks, a senior Department of Homeland Security told state and local officials Tuesday. The goal right now for Ukrainian government agencies and key business is resiliency in the face of waves of hacking. Some agencies have been able to come back online relatively quickly following the DDoS attacks last week. US and numerous allied governments, along with private-sector experts, are providing cybersecurity support to Ukraine on the ground and remotely. ""With a top-tier cyber power like Russia, you're not going to keep them out 100%, so the goal is resilience,"" Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN. Asked if the US should conduct its own hacking operations in response to Russian activities in Ukraine, Warner said the US generally avoids ""opening Pandora's Box in terms of cyber escalation."" ""So far, that's been the right approach,"" Warner added. ""But we've never seen this sort of circumstance where Putin is willing to unleash 190,000 troops"" and threaten Kyiv, he added. ""We don't know what he'll do in the cyber realm."" This headline and story have been updated with additional reporting.",3,0.5995628249827837,3.4731011567326497,-2.873538331749866,23
2022-02-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/europe/russia-videos-debunking-troops-intl/index.html,Debunking the videos Russia used as a pretext to send troops to eastern Ukraine,"In the course of a day, when Russia carefully choreographed its justification for sending troops into eastern Ukraine, two strange videos popped up on social media. One video allegedly showed the Monday shelling of a Russian border post in the Rostov region, which runs along Ukraine's eastern border. Another video, which surfaced on Telegram later that day, purportedly showed a group of Ukrainian saboteurs infiltrating Russia from Ukraine, in the same region. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said that two infantry vehicles were discovered ""violating the Ukraine-Russian border in the Rostov region."" Separately, Russia's southern military district said, according to state news agency RIA-Novosti, that five people from a sabotage team were ""eliminated."" These alleged incidents were soon fodder for a rarely televised session of Russia's National Security Council, where President Vladimir Putin invited reports from his inner circle. The Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Alexander Bortnikov, spoke of ""instances of shells hitting the territory of the Russian Federation, primarily in the Rostov region"" and said that ""two Ukrainian military sabotage groups reached the border with the Russian Federation in Luhansk region, coming from Mariupol."" Bortnikov said these kinds of incidents were causing a ""degradation of the situation"" in the separatist territories and that ""the Ukrainian security forces"" were responsible. But the videos that surfaced as alleged evidence of those incidents were not quite as advertised by Russian media. The first video, which allegedly showed a border post inside Russian territory that had been shelled by Ukrainian forces, first appeared on pro-Russian Telegram channels and on RIA-Novosti on Monday morning. Russia's FSB gave this account of the incident, saying that at 9:50 a.m. a ""projectile was fired from the territory of Ukraine"" and destroyed a checkpoint which was ""150 meters from the Russian-Ukrainian border."" Other Russian media muddied the water even further -- mentioning locations both in the south, in the direction of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol -- and in the north, near the Russian village of Mityakinskaya. However, a CNN analysis of the two videos confirms that they were filmed at a common location, just a few meters from each other. They were not scenes hundreds of kilometers apart. Moreover, geolocation shows the two videos were shot at the border between the separatist pro-Russian Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Russia, not in an area on -- or close to -- the border controlled by Ukrainian forces. And, as the UK-based Centre for Information Resilience first found, the location for the video is within DPR territory. In the same location is the second video, as first identified by open source intelligence analyst John Marquee. The second video first surfaced on a pro-Russian Telegram channel which claims to show helmet footage from a Ukrainian soldier crossing the Russian border. CNN analyzed metadata for the video, but key details appear to have been wiped out. A third video then surfaced purporting to show a Ukrainian armored vehicle that was used for the alleged incursion shown in the second video. The vehicle was shown after it was destroyed. However, people were quick to spot inconsistencies in the video. Oryx, a blog that specializes in global security issues, noted the video featured a BTR-70M APC vehicle which it said was not being used by the Ukrainian army. Analysts at Janes, a defense intelligence provider, told CNN the vehicle in the video ""is likely to be a Russian upgrade"" although it is difficult to be totally certain that it is not in Ukrainian service. The Russians have also reported that one Ukrainian soldier was captured during this alleged incursion, but his identity has not been revealed. For their part, the Ukrainians say all their soldiers are accounted for. None are missing; none were killed at the border. There is no way to connect the release of the videos with any official or state-run media outlet; they all surfaced from apparently private accounts. But the fact that they emerged very soon after these alleged incidents were reported is mysterious. One Ukrainian official, who was shown the helmet camera video, described it as ""Bollywood."" The Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, described the videos as straight out of Russia's ""fake factory."" But for the Kremlin, and its carefully staged grievances laid out Monday, they served their purpose.",17,4.019267478392533,3.9375216569336025,0.08174582145893039,29
2022-02-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/europe/analysis-russia-ukraine-crisis-intl/index.html,Russia blows past another off ramp in the Ukraine crisis,"For those watching the Ukraine crisis, February 20 was supposed to be a date to watch. The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics ended on Sunday, and some observers worried the closing ceremony might be a convenient moment for Russian President Vladimir Putin to launch military action. After all, history does rhyme: Russia escalated a brief conflict with Georgia in 2008 during the Beijing Summer Olympics, and Russia began its slow-rolling annexation of Crimea at the tail end of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. But Sunday also offered Russia a potential opening for de-escalation. After all, massive joint Russian military exercises in Belarus were slated to end on February 20, and the Kremlin had suggested Russian troops would go home after they finished, without giving concrete dates. Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei even said ""not a single"" Russian solider or piece of Russian military equipment will remain in Belarus once the drills ended. Instead, Russia blew past another potential off-ramp in the crisis. In a Sunday statement released by the Belarusian military on Telegram, Belarusian Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Viktor Khrenin said the Russians and Belarusians would continue their drills, saying the ""increase in military activity near the external borders of the Union State"" -- Russia and Belarus -- and the heightened tensions in Donbas necessitated the decision. Eyes remained on Donbas Sunday, as evacuees from separatist-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine continued to cross into southern Russia and from separatist-controlled regions, while reports filtered in of more shelling. Local officials in Russia's Rostov region have declared a state of emergency after separatist leaders on Friday ordered the evacuation of civilians from the region. But Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov laid blame on separatists in the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk republics for escalating the situation, accusing Russian-backed separatists of putting heavy weaponry in civilian areas and using it to bombard areas under Ukrainian government control. Meanwhile, the massing of Russian forces around Ukraine's borders appears to have continued, according to US intelligence estimates. A US official with direct knowledge of the intelligence told CNN Russia now has arrayed close to 75% of its conventional forces parked at Ukraine's doorstep, pointing to a high level of readiness to attack. So is diplomacy dead? Not entirely. Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone Sunday and ""agreed to continue to keep the dialogue open at various levels"" regarding the situation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said. A sticking point, however, remains the Minsk Agreement, which the Kremlin insists is the only way to resolve the crisis. But the Kyiv government sees it as a hastily devised agreement it was forced to accept at gunpoint. And Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesperson, had a word of caution for leaders engaging with the Russian leader by phone. Speaking to Pavel Zarubin, host of the TV program ""Moscow. Kremlin. Putin,"" Peskov suggested the Kremlin was prepared to disclose confidential discussions of high-level talks with other world leaders to counter what he described as deliberate and misleading leaks by foreign officials. ""I hope that we will not live in a world where we have to read out the transcripts of the closed part of the presidents' talks,"" Peskov said. ""But when it is necessary to prove the correctness of our president, we can and will do anything.""",29,4.4227118325654216,3.656423533360099,0.7662882992053226,4
2022-02-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/19/europe/surprising-unity-in-europe-ukraine-crisis-intl-cmd/index.html,Vladimir Putin has succeeded in uniting his opponents,"As the world watches and waits nervously to learn if Russian President Vladimir Putin will instruct his forces to invade Ukraine, European diplomats are privately finding one small silver lining to the crisis unfolding in Eastern Europe. The European Union and NATO have been remarkably united during this entire episode, which months ago was in no way a certainty. Behind the scenes, diplomats, NATO sources and EU officials have praised the ""unprecedented levels of unity and coordination"" which has ""strengthened the transatlantic alliance"" as both institutions have worked in lockstep with each other and the US, as one EU official put it. A senior European diplomat working in NATO said they had been ""really surprised but thankful"" at the regular contact and cooperation between leaderships of both the EU and NATO which has allowed the messaging directed at Moscow to be ""coordinated and consistent at the highest diplomatic level, despite the cultural and geographical differences of all the stakeholders."" While the two institutions should on paper be natural partners, this level of unity was never certain. Relations between the two Brussels-based bodies have been strained in recent years. A particular low came in 2019, when President Emmanuel Macron of France -- the EU's biggest military power since the departure of the UK -- said that what ""we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO,"" arguing that Europe needed to start thinking of itself as a strategic, geopolitical power. Macron has been Europe's strongest proponent of what Brussels calls ""strategic autonomy,"" a catch-all term used to describe the EU's diplomatic independence from larger global powers like the US and China. A large part of this drive for autonomy has been the EU's growing differences with traditional allies like the US and UK over economic and political relations with countries such as Russia and China. Across the EU's 27 member states there are varying levels of reliance on Chinese investment and Russian gas. Some EU nations are relatively relaxed about friendly relations with Moscow as a matter of economic convenience, while others, particularly former Soviet nations, look at what is happening in Ukraine with greater concern and view Putin's Russia with a similar degree of skepticism to the UK and US. The EU has also made efforts to have a greater control of its own security -- including the ability to deploy troops in its own right. Last year, the bloc put forward plans for something called the ""Strategic Compass,"" a proposal that would give Brussels the centralized power to activate ""rapid deployment groups"" of up to 5,000 troops provided by member states to tackle specific issues. Not all member states were thrilled with the idea as they fear it would undermine the security provided by NATO, meaning the proposal could be watered down and practically ineffective. With that in mind, a crisis like the one in Ukraine could almost have been tailor-made to sow division within the EU in a way that would prohibit strong action such as hard sanctions against Russia -- and create an almighty headache when it came to working alongside NATO in a unified Western response. However, in the face of Russian aggression, the EU has been unusually united and has complemented NATO's hard line, officials say. Officials say the reason it's worked so well is because the EU has stuck to its strengths, as has NATO. One senior NATO official told CNN that the Ukraine crisis has been a ""litmus test"" for how the two should operate. ""NATO is a political and military alliance and can talk about bolstering defenses on Europe's eastern flank. The EU is more of an economic powerhouse that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the US when it comes to sanctions,"" the official added. NATO officials, who have in recent years been irritated by and privately dismissive of the EU and its global ambitions, have acknowledged that Brussels has played a role that no other body could match in the crisis. A senior NATO diplomat explained that the EU has quickly put together proposals for a package of support funds, sanctions against Russia and emergency gas supplies. ""We cannot do that, we don't have the authority, and without even the proposal the Western response would unquestionably have been much weaker,"" they said. However, for all the warm words and talk of ""blueprints for cooperation"" over Ukraine, both sides accept that once this crisis is over -- however long that might be -- a frost could return to two of the West's most important defenders of democracy. ""What's worked well in this case is a clear delineation of duties based on competences. Where it won't work in the future is where that line gets blurred. The EU has only decided it wants to be a security player very recently and has made some errors in this crisis,"" a NATO official said. Multiple sources pointed to the coordinated response to a letter sent by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to several countries, including the US, Canada and European nations, outlining Russia's security concerns. Brussels delights in pointing out that despite sending the letter to dozens of national governments, Lavrov got just two replies: from NATO and the EU. An EU official told CNN that they could ""not think of a better example of the two bodies coming together as partners than the coordinated response to Lavrov."" But the senior NATO official explained that they thought the EU ""wasted far too much effort in writing a response to a letter that had probably been dashed off in five minutes and was designed to cause disruption."" In that respect, the official believes the EU was ""naive"" and played into Russia's hands, as the coordinated response ""consumed attention here for weeks but ultimately achieved little."" The European diplomat said that this specific crisis has worked well because ""it has been handled at very high diplomatic and geopolitical level. Things like coordinated visits and visible meetings of leaders."" However they too are pessimistic that anything ""in the weeds like energy or cyber security"" will see a return to two institutions with contradictory interests. Indeed, those issues could even become factors in Ukraine. But any self-congratulation in European capitals may be premature. Obviously, the situation on the Russian-Ukrainian border continues to be stark and terrifying. Clearly, the Western response to date has only pacified Putin so far and things could still get very ugly. However, after years of private -- and sometimes public hostility, the EU and NATO have found a way to get on the same page at a time of great uncertainty for the West. And with numerous looming crises beyond Ukraine, that can only be a good thing.",29,3.0005690026268916,2.674850574278896,0.32571842834799547,22
2022-02-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/europe/ukraine-crisis-whats-next-intl-cmd/index.html,The Ukraine conflict is moving fast. Here's what to watch for,"Tensions in Ukraine are escalating. The country's eastern Donbas region -- where fighting between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces have simmered since 2015 -- experienced its worst shelling in years this week. And diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions have, so far, failed to reach a conclusion. As tensions continue to spike, here's some key moments to watch in the ongoing Ukraine crisis. Ongoing wargames and nuclear drills Over the past week, Russian President Vladimir Putin has focused international attention onto a series of military drills that have tested Russia's conventional military power. Russia's Ministry of Defense has released flashy footage of live-fire exercises in neighboring Belarus involving tanks, artillery and fighter aircraft, and the wargames have showcased Russia's air defenses and its navy. On Saturday, Russia is set to test its strategic deterrent: its nuclear forces. The Kremlin announced Friday that Putin is ""likely to be in the situation center"" during military drills on Saturday, where ballistic and cruise missiles will be launched. Three decades after the end of the Cold War, both Russia and the United States have nuclear arsenals on ""hair trigger"" alert -- that is, nuclear warheads married up to their delivery systems and ready for launch at a moment's notice. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov noted that such training exercises are ""quite regular,"" and would involve appropriate international notifications. That's true, up to a point: These readiness exercises are happening against the background of international tensions over Ukraine that could actualize into a major war. Tensions escalate in Donbas Tensions in Ukraine reached their highest in years on Friday after pro-Russian separatist leaders in the breakaway republics of Ukraine's Donbas region called on civilians to evacuate -- and after an explosion wrecked a vehicle in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, creating more war jitters. Ukrainian officials deny any plans to retake Donbas by force, saying that they see this week's incidents as an effort by Russia to create a pretext to launch an invasion. But Russian state media have already sounded the alarm, showing images of civilians departing Donbas on buses heading to Russia's Rostov oblast, just across the border. It is unclear how many civilians will be evacuated or if there will other incidents in Ukraine's east that Russia might seize on as a potential pretext for war. A diplomatic balancing act Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to attend the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, despite US President Joe Biden's administration plea to reconsider those plans to leave Ukraine amid concerns about a possible Russian invasion. It's possible that unexpected surprises could cut his visit short. The US and NATO make moves The US has already bolstered its military presence in eastern Europe; the US military announced a training mission in Hungary. How will the US and its allies react to the latest moves by Russia? Will we see more evacuations of diplomats remaining in Kyiv? Olympics end Russia has said its military drills are slated to end on Sunday, coinciding with the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Will the Olympics be remembered as a unifying international moment, or as a tragic preamble to war? That is anyone's guess.",29,3.765367441245875,3.7784386647065884,-0.013071223460713544,4
2022-02-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/politics/treasury-banks-russia-cyber-meeting/index.html,US officials prep big banks and utilities for potential Russian cyberattacks as Ukraine crisis deepens,"Officials from multiple US agencies met Thursday with executives from big US banks to discuss how they might respond to Russian hacking threats as US officials warn that Russia could invade Ukraine at any time, five people briefed on the meeting told CNN. The meeting — which covered how to defend against potential Russia-backed hacking attempts against US financial institutions should the Biden administration sanction Russian entities — shows how US officials continue to see cyberspace as a domain of risk so long as the Ukraine crisis drags on. It comes as other critical infrastructure sectors, such as electric utilities, are on alert for any Russian activity. The meeting came as President Joe Biden and his top officials spent the day laying out dire warnings about the potential for a Russian invasion. With an estimated 150,000 Russian troops positioned around the Ukrainian border, it was a day that underscored palpable concern that the pathway to a diplomatic off-ramp was growing exceedingly narrow. Biden said Friday that he was convinced Russian President Vladimir Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine, but emphasized that room for diplomacy remains. The administration's warnings have coincided with efforts to lay the groundwork for an array of sanctions the US and allies have promised would be deployed in the event of Russian military action. Officials from the White House, Treasury Department, FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) attended the cybersecurity meeting Thursday, the people familiar with the meeting said. Executives from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which is the only US bank currently operating in Ukraine, were invited. ""We have good insight into Russian capabilities, or those of aligned actors, based on past actions, so we've approached this [process] with those in mind,"" one US official told CNN. US officials such as CISA Director Jen Easterly continue to say there are ""no specific credible threats to the US homeland' stemming from the Russian military's surrounding Ukraine. But officials are also preaching vigilance and, as CNN reported Monday, asking private executives to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious digital activity to the government. As US officials keep a close eye for any Russian hacking activity on US networks, they moved quickly on Friday to blame Russia's GRU military intelligence agency for a cyberattack that temporarily blocked access to the websites of Ukrainian banks this week. The banking sector got a lesson in the cyber risks that can come with geopolitics in 2012 and 2013, when, following Western sanctions on Iran's nuclear program, Iranian hackers overwhelmed the websites of dozens of US banks with phony traffic, costing tens of millions of dollars in lost business. The experience has loomed large in the minds of cybersecurity executives at US financial institutions, which have strengthened their defenses in recent years. Experts consider the financial and electric sectors two of the more mature in its cyber defenses. A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment on Thursday's meeting. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup declined to comment. A senior administration official told CNN that the White House and federal agencies have been preparing since November for ""any potential disruptions to our critical infrastructure and possible impacts to individuals and communities."" 'Tabletop exercises' The potential cyber threat has also featured in so-called ""tabletop"" exercises that have taken place inside the administration in recent months, as officials across the government have met to game out response possibilities that come with Russian escalation and potential invasion. ""We have created a process for agencies to quickly assess the impact of cyber [and] physical incidents and to inform the White House of the same,"" the official added. One tipping point that could trigger Russia-backed hacking against US organizations is if the Biden administration imposes the ""swift and severe"" sanctions that officials have been promising if Russia further invades Ukraine. US officials have sought input on potential market effects of any new sanctions, which officials have suggested would go further than any package prior, with potential targets ranging from financial institutions and networks to export controls designed to impair critical Russian economic sectors reliant on American software and equipment. As tensions in the last several days have ratcheted up to their highest level yet, the tempo of the work to plan for what may occur in the wake of sanctions being put into place, already at a high level, has also increased, one official said. Grid regulator tells utilities to be at 'highest possible level' of preparedness Federal officials and executives from key sectors like banking and energy have been keeping a close eye on any potential spillover effects from US-Russia tensions over Ukraine. Those preparations included an Energy Department briefing on the history of Russian cyber capabilities in December for America's largest utilities, and a previous classified briefing from Treasury for big banks, CNN previously reported. North American electric utilities should be at their ""highest possible level"" of preparedness for ""potential Russia-linked cyber and disinformation activity"" in light of US-Russia tensions over Ukraine, the North American grid regulator said in an advisory to the power sector this week obtained by CNN. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) -- a not-for-profit regulatory authority backed by the US and Canadian governments -- said it was unaware of a ""specific, credible threat to the North American electricity industry from Russia [or associated threat actors]."" But the regulator said it was making a ""proactive recommendation"" for the electric industry to be vigilant for any anomalous cyber activity. ""During these heightened tensions, NERC recommends that entities adopt the highest possible security posture for their most critical system assets and have response, mitigation, and staffing plans in place for this escalating conflict,"" NERC said. NERC regularly tracks various cyber threats and communicates with utilities about them. The electric sector has also in the last year deployed additional threat-detection tools on the more sensitive industrial control systems that help deliver power as part of a US government-backed initiative. ""If one of us gets punched in the face, all of us know about it,"" said Robert M. Lee, CEO of industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos, of the greater visibility of threats in the sector. US electric utilities and officials have also carefully studied cyberattacks in 2015 and 2016 that cut power in parts of Ukraine, and which the Justice Department later blamed on Russia's GRU. The Department of Energy and the Pentagon's research arm have in recent years hosted a series of drills for US grid operators to drill for mock cyberattacks modeled after the Ukrainian incident. Patrick C. Miller, the CEO and owner of Oregon-based Ampere Industrial Security, said the NERC alert was in that spirit of preparing for advanced cyberattacks. The Ukraine cyberattacks in 2015 and 2016 ""established the fact that power systems"" are now fair game for adversaries, Miller told CNN.",3,5.742851629414115,4.428239819832518,1.3146118095815975,23
2022-02-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html,What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained,"After months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Ukraine's border, Russia is ratcheting up pressure on its ex-Soviet neighbor, threatening to destabilize Europe and draw in the United States. Russia has been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep. The aggression has sparked warnings from US intelligence officials that a Russian invasion could be imminent. A whirlwind of diplomatic efforts in recent weeks has so far failed to defuse tensions in the region. The escalation in the years-long conflict between Russia and Ukraine has triggered the greatest security crisis on the continent since the Cold War, raising the specter of a dangerous showdown between Western powers and Moscow. So how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know. What's the situation on the border? More than 150,000 Russian troops now encircle Ukraine on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials. The White House has repeatedly warned that Putin could launch a full invasion of Ukraine at any moment. On February 21, Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what could be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation. The move has been condemned by Western leaders for violating international law and breaching Ukraine's territorial integrity. A day later, Putin said Russia's recognition of the DNR and LNR actually encompasses the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Currently the pro-Russian separatists currently only control around a third of those districts, but their independence claims include the entire areas. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning an assault, but an escalation in shelling in eastern Ukraine has heightened fears that it could be stoking the violence to justify a wider conflict. As the situation on Ukraine's border has intensified, NATO has raised the readiness of its rapid response force, while member countries put troops on standby and deployed battalions, planes and ships to the region. The US ordered 3,000 additional soldiers to be deployed to Poland, bringing the total number of reinforcements sent to Europe in recent weeks to about 5,000. The US says it has no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. The US has unveiled a ""first tranche"" of new sanctions against Russia, including on two large financial institutions, the country's sovereign debt, and Russian elites and their family members. Biden and European leaders have previously warned that Russia would suffer serious consequences should Putin move ahead with a wider invasion. But that has not stopped Russia from continuing to bolster its military positions. In late 2021 and early 2022, satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow's closest international ally. Despite receiving funding, training and equipment from the US and other NATO member countries, experts say Ukraine would be significantly outmatched by Russia's military, which has been modernized under Putin's leadership. If an all-out war broke out between the two countries, tens of thousands of civilians could die and up to 5 million could be made refugees, according to some estimates. What has set the stage for the conflict? Ukraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future -- crossing a red line for Russia. Putin has indicated he sees NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act."" In interviews and speeches, he has emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe. In early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. In the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create ""a pretext for an invasion."" What does Putin want? In a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people,"" and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia's orbit through a ""forced change of identity."" That type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin's emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine's own sovereignty. But Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West's ""puppet."" In fact, Putin's efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance. In December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe -- proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters. Putin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. ""It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,"" he said at his annual news conference late last year. ""Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep."" High-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe's leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine's east -- known as the Normandy Format talks -- could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis. In a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a ""genocide"" against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress -- echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea. But less than a week later, after Russia's upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements ""no longer exist,"" adding: ""What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?"" The agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 -- which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine -- have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved. Moscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and -- although unclear in what sequence -- would also restore the Ukrainian government's control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics. Putin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. ""Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,"" Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: ""We are not his."" What is Ukraine's view? President Zelensky has repeatedly downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. There's a similar mood in Kyiv, where Ukrainians have continued to go about their daily business, despite international warnings and as foreign governments withdraw their diplomatic staff from the capital. Elsewhere in the country, residents have been preparing for the worst -- packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists. Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN. Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked.

2022-02-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/europe/russia-military-video-intl-cmd/index.html,Russia says its units are going home after exercises near Ukraine. Evidence suggests otherwise,"Don't Trust -- Do Verify: That's the unofficial mantra from Western officials in response to Russia's declarations that some of their units that have been encircling Ukraine are now returning to base. Russia appears keen to prove those declarations to the world through well-produced videos distributed by the Ministry of Defense on Tuesday and Wednesday. In several of those videos, units from the Southern and Western Military Districts were said to be going back to base from Crimea after completing their exercises there. Traffic heading east across the bridge over the Kerch Strait included tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and fuel trucks, which supported the units. Filmed from multiple angles, the videos were designed to reinforce what the Kremlin has insisted all along: that an invasion of Ukraine is not and never has been on its agenda. ""Southern Military District troops, which have completed their tasks as part of planned tactical exercises at combined arms ranges on the Crimean peninsula, have begun to return to their permanent deployment points,"" the ministry said Tuesday. But two of the units leaving, according to Russian newpaper Izvestia, were elements of the 3rd and 150th Motor Rifle Divisions. They are based close to Ukraine at Rostov-on-Don and Belgorod respectively, a short drive from the border. When those units get home, they will be closer to Ukraine than they were in Crimea. Other Russian footage from Tuesday -- including drone shots -- showed the elaborate departure of T72 tanks from an unidentified rural area. CNN geolocated the location to a training ground near Otreshkovo, a Russian village some 120 kilometers (around 75 miles) from the border. But the direction the departing tank convoy was taking is far from conclusive. The video shows tanks heading in two different directions, both to a railway station and to the training ground. The next day, the defense ministry posted more video of the same unit being loaded onto a train -- and then later published another video of the train rumbling eastwards at night. Its destination is unknown. Russian diplomats have seized on the Defense Ministry's declared pull-back to accuse the West of hysteria in amping up the threat of an invasion. Russia's Ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov told German newspaper Die Welt on Wednesday that there will be no attack on ""Wednesday, next week, neither in the coming weeks, nor months."" For the United States and NATO, the jury is still out. US President Joe Biden said Tuesday the US assessed there are some 150,000 Russian forces surrounding Ukraine. NATO's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg concurred, saying, ""just that we see movement of forces, so battle tanks, doesn't confirm a real withdrawal. It has been a bit up and down, back and forth all the way. But the trend over the last weeks and months has been a steady increase in the Russian capabilities close to Ukraine's borders."" CNN -- along with a number of independent experts -- continues to monitor and geolocate social media content emerging from Russia and Belarus that show its military on the move. The evidence to hand is that plenty of Russian armor remains close to the Ukrainian border -- and some of it is still moving closer. On Wednesday, T90 tanks were filmed moving through slush in Tomarovka, a village in the Belgorod region of Russia just miles from the Ukrainian frontier, according to multiple videos reviewed. In the nearby, village of Veselaya Lopan, satellite imagery shows a new temporary military camp. And in the past week, more helicopters -- for both combat and transport -- have arrived both in Crimea and in areas close to Ukraine's eastern border, according to satellite imagery reviewed by CNN. Those helicopters would provide important air support to any ground offensive. New satellite imagery also shows a curious development in southern Belarus, around six kilometers (approximately four miles) from the Ukrainian border and also close to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. A long pontoon bridge has been built in the last few days across the River Pripyat, not far from where Belarus and Russian forces are carrying out extensive joint exercises. While there is little military activity in the immediate area, the bridge would dramatically cut the time needed to reach the Ukrainian border and avoid population centers. An additional satellite image from Planet Labs also shows that after January 8, a new road was constructed that leads to the bridge. Western intelligence and military officials are closely tracking the construction as part of the support infrastructure Russia is putting in place in advance of a potential invasion, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Still, past exercises in the area have included the construction of pontoons, highlighting a well-known dilemma in intelligence capture: how to reconcile growing and changing capabilities with unknown intent. Another as yet unexplained development: Maxar had previously observed the establishment of a large detachment of Russian forces - including tanks - near the town of in south-eastern Belarus, some 30 miles from the border. Those forces appear to have dispersed, Maxar says, noting that a ""military convoy was seen moving west on today's imagery."" Analysts say it will take at least several days to establish whether there is a true drawdown of Russian forces from temporary positions around Ukraine, or whether -- as many western officials believe -- it's more maneuvering. The Conflict Intelligence Team, which has long experience tracking Russian military movements, told CNN: ""We are currently unable to either confirm or deny any actual withdrawal happening. We've seen vehicles of the 58th army of the Southern Military District being loaded on trains in Crimea (where they had previously deployed unannounced), but we would need some additional time and evidence to say if they are actually withdrawing to their permanent bases."" Konrad Muzyka, an analyst at Rochan Consulting, an aerospace and defense consultancy said in a tweet, ""Previously announced withdrawals meant more Russian troop deployments near Ukraine. New trains with equipment keep on arriving. The withdrawal would be a welcome development, but recent history tells us these announcements are not genuine. Need a few days to verify."" In January and early February, dozens of social media videos showed Russian forces heading towards Ukraine's borders nearly every day. So far, there's been no similar surge of content showing those forces moving in the opposite direction.",14,3.426467797822286,4.996874259550879,-1.5704064617285924,0

But the images of a shelled kindergarten in eastern Ukraine shifted international focus to the Donbas region, where the world braced itself for signs that the simmering conflict there might escalate very seriously and catastrophically. Thankfully, the shell that hit the Stanytsia Luhanska school took no lives. But they were a reminder of the very real stakes for people living near the Line of Contact that separates Ukrainian government forces from Russian-backed separatists. For weeks, world leaders have been shuttling back and forth to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and making high-level phone calls to try to put the brakes on a confrontation between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis. Yet in Moscow today, there's been no signs of a breakthrough, but a clear ratcheting up of tension. On Thursday afternoon local time, US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan paid a visit to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he received a long-awaited response from the Russian government to a written document delivered to Russia three weeks earlier. The document made clear that the Russians laid full blame on the US and its allies for stoking the Ukraine crisis, even as evidence continues to mount of that as many as 150,000 Russian troops are arrayed around Ukraine's borders. ""There is no plan for a 'Russian invasion' of Ukraine, as the U.S. and its allies have been alleging at the official level since last Autumn,"" the document, released by Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti said. ""Therefore, claims about 'Russian culpability for the escalation' cannot be interpreted as anything other than an attempt to pressure and devalue Russian offers of security guarantees."" At about the same time, the US State Department confirmed Russia had expelled the second-most senior diplomat at the US diplomatic mission in Moscow, a move that US President Joe Biden's administration called an ""escalatory"" step. That escalation has clearly been incremental: A senior State Department official said that Bart Gorman, the US deputy chief of mission in Moscow was formally expelled by Moscow earlier this year, given two weeks to depart and left Moscow last week. So where does that leave diplomacy? It's still not entirely dead. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met on Thursday with his Italian counterpart, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. Lavrov essentially laid out the same complaint that was in the written reply delivered to the US: The Americans and NATO have ignored Russia's core security concerns, he said, and none of the secondary issues -- on the technical details of arms control, for instance -- can be resolved ""until we agree on our key positions."" And on those key positions, particularly regarding the issue of who can join NATO, Russia and the West remain very, very far apart.",29,4.331360553998866,4.23715529140476,0.09420526259410611,26
2022-02-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/us-russia-defense-contractors-hackers/index.html,US says Russian hackers have collected intelligence from American defense contractors,"Russian government-backed hackers have acquired sensitive information on the development and deployment of US weapons by breaching American defense contractors over the last two years, US security agencies said in a public advisory on Wednesday. The information gathered is unclassified, but offers ""significant insight into US weapons platforms development and deployment timelines,"" and also covers export-controlled technology, according to the FBI, National Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). It's one of the clearest public statements yet from the US government on how Kremlin-linked hackers have gathered intelligence on US defense contractors — a problem Washington has faced for years. The intrusions hit contractors supporting every US military branch, including the Air Force, Army, Navy and Space Force, as well as firms that work on defense and intelligence programs, US officials said. The advisory comes as US officials warn Russia against further invading Ukraine, along whose border Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops, according to US President Joe Biden. US government agencies have for years regularly released information on state-sponsored hacking threats, and US officials continue to say there is no credible, specific cyber threat to the US homeland tied to the Ukraine crisis. Contractors targeted by Russian hackers over the last two years have been involved in aircraft design and the development of combat and weapons systems, among other things, the US agencies said. ""By acquiring proprietary internal documents and email communications, adversaries may be able to adjust their own military plans and priorities, hasten technological development efforts, inform foreign policymakers of US intentions, and target potential sources for recruitment,"" the advisory says. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the US advisory. Russia routinely denies allegations that it conducts hacking operations. ""Both the United States and Russia are continually probing, through cyber, to pick up information on weapons systems, on intelligence, etc.,"" Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday when asked about the new US advisory. ""The compromise of intelligence information is [on] both sides,"" said Reed, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""And I think we're very well prepared with our cyber operations to assist the Ukrainians."" Reed said that the US generally has a ""very active cyber operation against Russia. That was demonstrated ... before the 2020 elections, when we literally took out some Russian sites who we knew were interfering with our election."" President Joe Biden said at a January 19 news conference that the US could respond with hacking operations of its own to further Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine. US officials have been publicly and privately advising US critical infrastructure firms for weeks to check their networks for potential Russian hacking threats. Reed said that US Cyber Command, the military's hacking and cyber defense unit, ""is on full alert"" in the event of any escalation from Russia in cyberspace. US spy agencies have long used cyber tools to collect intelligence on rival powers such as Russia and China. The US National Security Agency looked for ways to exploit products made by Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, The New York Times reported in 2014, citing classified documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

2022-02-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/europe/ukraine-russia-news-wednesday/index.html,"Russian buildup continues, but insufficient for full-scale invasion, Ukrainian military intelligence says","Russia's buildup of troops at Ukraine's borders has persisted, despite Moscow's claims of a drawdown, but the number of Russian forces remains insufficient for an invasion, according to a Ukrainian intelligence report shared exclusively with CNN. The total number of Russian troops at the border has increased in recent days to more than 148,000, including more than 126,000 ground troops, the report says, echoing US intelligence about the build-up. A Ukrainian presidential spokesperson affirmed the reporting in comments to CNN ahead of an address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was sending some of its troops at the border back to base after completing exercises. On Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg rejected Putin's claim and said the military buildup was continuing, describing it as ""the most serious crisis in decades."" A statement by NATO later on Wednesday said the buildup was ""very large scale, unprovoked and unjustified."" NATO also said it was deploying additional land forces in the eastern part of the alliance, in addition to maritime and air assets. The measures, the statement said, remained ""proportionate"" and ""non-escalatory,"" in response to the ""serious threat"" of the Russian troop buildup. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said that there was ""no meaningful pullback."" ""Unfortunately there's a difference between what Russia says and what it does. And what we're seeing is no meaningful pullback,"" Blinken said on ABC's Good Morning America. ""On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border,"" he said. The US alleged on Wednesday evening that Russian forces massed along Ukraine's borders have increased by approximately 7,000 troops in recent days, with a senior US administration official saying the increase renders Russia's assertion of withdrawal ""false."" The official said that Putin's public openness to diplomacy was a guise, saying, ""Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk, and make claims about de-escalation, while privately mobilizing for war."" According to the new Ukrainian intelligence report, 87 Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) are on constant alert around Ukraine, up from 53 which are usually based in the area. BTGs are formations that consist of 800 to 1,000 Russian troops. The numbers are consistent with the latest US assessment of the Russian troop buildup, but deviates from Western statements by playing down the threat of a full-scale invasion. ""The Russian military contingent near the Ukrainian border is insufficient to carry out a successful large-scale armed aggression against Ukraine,"" the report said. Instead, Ukrainian intelligence believes that Russia has focused its efforts on ""destabilizing Ukraine's internal situation"" using punitive economic and energy-related tactics, as well as cyberattacks. Largest cyberattack of its kind A high-volume cyberattack that temporarily blocked access to the websites of Ukrainian defense agencies and banks on Tuesday was ""the largest (such attack) in the history of Ukraine,"" according to a government minister. Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who is also the minister of digital transformation, added that it is too early to tell who was responsible for the attack. The so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack -- which bombarded Ukrainian websites with phony traffic -- was coordinated and well planned, officials said. DDoS attacks often disrupt access to IT systems, but their impact can be more psychological rather than having any direct effect on a country's critical infrastructure. 'Day of Unity' Meanwhile on Wednesday, Ukraine marked a so-called ""Day of Unity"" -- called for by Zelensky -- as a show of defiance against Russia. Hundreds of people observed flag-raising ceremonies in some of Ukraine's city centers. ""This gathering is how we show our power to Putin,"" Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy told CNN. Speaking from the port city of Mariupol, which is believed to be vulnerable to attack in the case of an invasion, Zelensky vowed to ""not succumb"" to Russian provocations. ""We are not intimidated by any predictions (of war), any people, enemies, or any dates, because we will defend ourselves, whether it's February 16th, 17th, or 18th -- in March or April or September or December,"" he said. ""What's important is this is the year 2022, not 2014. We've become much stronger,"" Zelensky added, referring to Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea.

The US government is investigating the cyberattack on Ukrainian websites, a top State Department official said Wednesday, while suggesting that Russia has a history of carrying out such hacks. ""But who is best at this, who uses this weapon all around the world? Obviously, the Kremlin,"" Undersecretary of State Toria Nuland said on CBS This Morning. ""While we're still investigating and doing forensics along with the Ukrainians, I think what's most important is that these cyberattacks were not very successful,"" Nuland said. She credited Ukrainian officials for responding quickly and helping the websites recover. Internet traffic hitting Ukrainian websites during the DDoS attack was ""three orders of magnitude more than regularly observed traffic,"" according to data collected by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. Ninety-nine percent of the traffic involved a type of digital request to computer servers, ""indicating the attackers were attempting to overwhelm Ukrainian servers,"" said Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike's senior vice president of intelligence. A Ukrainian intelligence report recently obtained by CNN pointed to Russia's effort to destabilize ""Ukraine's internal situation by using economic, energy, information, cyber, social, ethnic, and other tools."" Ukraine has concluded that Russia and Belarus were responsible for a separate cyberattack that hit government websites last month. ""As a result of a massive hacker attack on the night of January 14, 2022, the web pages of the Government of Ukraine"" were shut down. The attacks were carried out by a group affiliated with the Russian and Belarusian special services,"" the Ukrainian intelligence report said. Similarities in the infrastructure used in Tuesday's DDoS attack and the one last month suggest the incidents could be connected, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday. In mid-January scores of Ukrainian government websites were targeted in a cyberattack with threatening text warning Ukrainians to ""be afraid and wait for the worst,"" and alleging their personal information had been hacked. Ukraine claimed Russia was most likely behind the attack, which affected the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies.",3,1.2333483795481286,7.255088407165205,-6.021740027617077,23

CNN has geolocated and authenticated social media videos of these movements -- though there are likely many more that are not being observed. Some of the videos come from official sources; most are from TikTok or YouTube. They are being analyzed by online observers and often complement satellite imagery. Convoys near Belgorod Here's a convoy moving near Belgorod in western Russia, just across the border from the major Ukrainian city of Kharkiv: There's plenty of other evidence of the military build-up in the Belgorod region too. CNN geolocated these videos at the village of Sereteno, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the border. They were uploaded on Sunday and show tanks moving through the area. These videos can be geolocated to this spot: Night-time movements Russian forces are also moving at night in the area -- with tanks being offloaded from trains. There's more snow here than further south -- CNN geolocated this video to a village near Belgorod: Tanks around Voronezh The area around Voronezh also appears to be getting pretty crowded. A large collection of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles was filmed in the last couple of days from a passing train. According to analysts they are part of the Russian 1st Guards Tank Army. And seen from other angles: CNN has geolocated these clips to this spot: Helicopters near Belgorod In the last couple of days, more social media videos have featured the arrival of helicopters near the Ukrainian border. They could offer important protection for ground troops in the event of an offensive. These were filmed near Belgorod: The Russian build-up includes tanks, infantry fighting vehicles known as BMPs and self-propelled artillery -- as seen here on a train on the outskirts of Belgorod: A lot of the hardware is traveling south from the city of Kursk. CNN geolocated this video, which appears to have been filmed Saturday. Missiles and artillery support Michael Kofman, Russia analyst at CNA, a nonprofit organization based in Virginia, notes that units in Kursk (such as the 6th Combined Arms Army) ""appear to be moving up to Belgorod with district level artillery support. He says the 1st Guards Tank Army has started to move too -- ""presumably to a final staging area."" Of particular concern is the movement of convoys of Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles, which seems to have picked up in the last few weeks in various parts of western Russia. If a conflict began, these would likely be used to attack fixed Ukrainian positions -- such as command and control sites. They have a range of up to 250 miles (402 km) and have been spotted in recent satellite imagery. Rocket launchers near border Russian and Belarusian troops began sizeable joint exercises last week near the Polish border, but some Russian forces are on the move many miles from where the exercises are taking place and have taken up positions close to where the borders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus meet. CNN geolocated this convoy, which includes multiple rocket launchers, to a spot about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of the Ukrainian border. Russian weaponry -- and ships -- continue to close in on the Ukrainian border. Sites where equipment had been pre-positioned more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the border have been progressively emptied as units have moved forward. There are Russian units within a few miles of Ukraine all the way from the Sea of Azov, along the Ukrainian border and into Belarus. ""Russia's current military buildup near Ukraine is unprecedented,"" tweeted Rob Lee, from the Department of War Studies at King's College London. ""This is not like previous war scares or the buildup in the spring [of 2021]. The amount of Russian aerial, ground, and naval military power near Ukraine now is quantifiably far greater.""

2022-02-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/europe/russia-troops-bases-analysis-intl/index.html,Russia says it's moving some troops to their bases. What does this mean?,"On Wednesday, Belarus' foreign minister said ""not a single"" Russian soldier or piece of military equipment would remain in its territory after joint military drills conclude, while the Russian Ministry of Defense released video showing military equipment crossing the bridge from Crimea into Russia. This all comes a day after Russia announced that some troops would be returning to their home bases after completing exercises -- but President Joe Biden said the US had not yet verified any drawdown of the 150,000 Russian troops amassed near Ukraine's borders. How significant are the latest developments? Let's start with what we know. The statement given on Tuesday by Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, was very short on specifics. Troops of Russia's Southern and Western Military Districts, he said, had begun loading up their gear to return to their bases, but gave few specifics about where those units had been exercising, what their home stations are, or how many troops in total were heading home. What's more, we know from Ministry of Defense news releases that exercises in Belarus involve a significant number of troops from around the Russian Federation, including units based in Russia's Eastern Military District -- several time zones east of European Russia, a massive region bounded at its eastern edge by the Pacific Ocean. Russia is a massive country spanning 11 time zones; its military divides the country into five administrative territories: the Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Districts and the Northern Fleet. Troops leaving exercises in Crimea -- annexed by Russia in 2014 -- were technically exercising inside Russia's Southern Military District. Troops of the Southern Military District could potentially be returning to bases in the north Caucasus or Rostov oblast. Tuesday's statements, then, gives us very little official clue about how significant this move is: It could easily be a rotation -- with fresh troops falling in -- or a gradual drawdown after exercises. And Konashenkov made it clear that Russia's current exercises at sea have a fairly global sweep, taking place in ""operationally important areas of the world's oceans"" and in the waters adjacent to the territory of Russia. There are things to watch out for in the coming days. Putin and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko are set to meet this week, and we may get some hint on when the exercises in Belarus will conclude -- and when Russian soldiers there will go home. Asked about whether a decision on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarus would be made during that meeting, Kremlin spokesperson Peskov said: ""Let's not jump ahead. Let's wait for the meeting."" In the meantime, some Western officials were skeptical of the Russian troop announcement and said there had been no proof that a de-escalation of the crisis is on the cards. ""The signs coming from Moscow about willingness to continue to engage in diplomatic efforts ... gives some reason for cautious optimism. But we will, of course, follow very closely what's happening on the ground and whether this is reflected in some real de-escalation of the Russian military build-up in around Ukraine,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Tuesday.",29,2.918013179904754,1.415640613804974,1.50237256609978,4
2022-02-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/europe/ukraine-russia-news-tuesday-troop-pullback-intl/index.html,"Putin says some Russian troops are withdrawing after drills, but skepticism in Ukraine and US remains","President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Russia was sending some troops back to base after completing drills and that while he is open to further negotiations on the Ukraine crisis, Moscow's security demands were an ""unconditional priority."" Russia's claims about troop movements were met with skepticism from Western officials, who said they had seen no evidence that any partial withdrawal had begun. United States President Joe Biden told reporters Tuesday that the US has ""not yet verified the Russian military units are returning to their home bases,"" saying that they ""remain very much in a threatening position."" Speaking earlier at a news conference in Moscow alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Putin said he continued to view Western deterrence measures as a ""direct and immediate threat to national security."" ""The responses we received from the United States and NATO members to security guarantees proposals, in our opinion, do not meet the three basic Russian requirements,"" Putin said. ""We are ready to continue this joint work further. We are also ready to follow the negotiation track but all issues must be considered as a whole, without being separated from the main Russian proposals, the implementation of which is an unconditional priority for us."" Biden said Tuesday that Russia has amassed ""more than 150,000 troops circling Ukraine and Belarus, and along Ukraine's border,"" underscoring fears from Western and Ukrainian intelligence officials that an invasion could be imminent. Among the Kremlin's demands are a guarantee that Ukraine will never be permitted to join NATO and that the alliance roll back its expansion in Eastern Europe. The US and its NATO allies have repeatedly said such proposals are non-starters. Putin also invoked the word ""genocide"" Tuesday to describe the situation in territories in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatist militants, calling out the West for what he insinuated was a double standard for justifying military intervention. Claims of discrimination against Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine were one of the justifications Russia used when it annexed Crimea in 2014. Putin's comments came hours after the Russian defense ministry said some troops from its Southern and Western military districts had begun to return to their home stations. The announcement did not specify where those troops were permanently based, where they had been exercising, or how many of them were withdrawing, and it was viewed with skepticism by officials from Ukraine, the US and NATO, who called on Russia to provide proof it was willing to deescalate the crisis on the border. ""Various statements are constantly being made from the Russian Federation, so we already have a rule: 'Do not hear and then believe. But do see and then believe,'"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a news conference in Kyiv. ""When we see the withdrawal, then we will believe in de-escalation."" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had not yet seen ""any sign of deescalation on the ground,"" but added that ""signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue"" were grounds for cautious optimism. Personnel from Russia's Southern military district began returning to base from Crimea -- the territory annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 -- following the conclusion of exercises, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported Tuesday, citing Southern military district spokesperson Col. Vadim Astafyev. ""The personnel of the battalion tactical groups made marches to the areas of railway stations, where the loading of military equipment on the echelons is organized. Heavy tracked armored vehicles -- tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery -- are fixed on the platforms of the wagons, Astafyev said. Earlier Tuesday, Major General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian defense ministry, announced the troop movements but also added that large-scale drills would continue. ""In the armed forces of the Russian Federation, a complex of large-scale operational training measures by the forces continues, with almost all military districts, fleets and airborne troops taking part in them,"" he said. ""As part of the test of the reaction forces of the Union State, a joint Russian-Belarusian exercise 'Allied Resolve-2022' is being held on the territory of the Republic of Belarus."" Konashenkov also said a series of naval drills -- involving surface ships, submarines and naval aviation -- was underway both in ""operationally important areas of the world's oceans"" and in the waters adjacent to the territory of Russia. ""Exercises are continuing with formations and military units at other training grounds on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" he added. Meanwhile on Tuesday, a cyberattack hit the websites of Ukraine's defense ministry and armed forces, and the websites of two Ukrainian banks. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the hacking incident. 'Still time to step back from the brink' The Kremlin's troop announcement came a day after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said there was still room for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. In a carefully choreographed meeting that was shown on Russian television on Monday, Putin asked Lavrov: is there a ""chance to reach an agreement with our partners on key issues that are of concern to us, or is it just an attempt to drag us into an endless negotiation process that has no logical resolution?"" Seated at the opposite end of a very long table, Lavrov responded: ""If we are ready to listen to some counter-proposals, it seems to me that our possibilities are far from being exhausted."" NATO's Stoltenberg on Tuesday expressed hope that a war could be avoided, but said the alliance would not compromise on its core principles. ""Everything is now in place for a new attack, but Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday. The flurry of high-profile diplomacy continued Tuesday with Scholz becoming the latest leader to travel to Moscow for talks. Scholz, who was meeting Putin for the first time as the German Chancellor, said it was the leaders' ""damned duty to prevent a war in Europe."" ""For us Germans, but also for all Europeans, it is important that sustainable security cannot be achieved against Russia, but only with Russia,"" Scholz said. However, while Scholz was urging de-escalation, he didn't shy away from criticizing Russia, specifically mentioning the jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who is currently facing another trial. ""As far as Mr. Navalny is concerned, my position is very clear, this is not compatible with the principles of the rule of law."" Meanwhile, US ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said Tuesday the US was ""monitoring the situation"" after the Kremlin's troop announcement, but added that the US ""will have to verify"" any claims of a potential move towards deescalation by Russia. ""We have noticed today that Russia is claiming that they are moving towards some sort of de-escalation. We are monitoring the situation,"" Smith said. ""We will have to verify whether or not that is in fact the case. Speaking during a press briefing in Brussels, the US ambassador further noted that Russia ""made a similar claim"" regarding a potential de-escalation of tensions in December, but this later proved false. But while the Kremlin was talking about troops returning home, satellite images released by Maxar Technologies revealed fresh signs of a Russian buildup. An analysis of the images showed that at least 60 helicopters had landed within the past few days at a previously vacant airbase in Russian-occupied Crimea. The helicopters are a mixture of transport and attack aircraft. Archival satellite imagery reviewed by CNN indicates the base at Donuzlav Lake on the northwest coast of Crimea has been vacant since at least 2003. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he was not encouraged by the latest intelligence on Russia's buildup around Ukraine and said western leaders were receiving ""mixed signals"" from Moscow. ""We've got Russian field hospitals being constructed near the border with Ukraine, in Belarus for [what] only can be construed as a preparation for an invasion,"" Johnson said. ""You've got more battalion tactical groups actually being brought closer to the border with Ukraine, according to the intelligence that we're seeing."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave a noncommittal response Tuesday when asked about a move by Russian lawmakers to appeal to President Putin to recognize two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent. Donetsk and Luhank have been controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Asked in a conference call with reporters about the legislative action, Peskov said: ""No one remains indifferent to the fate of Donbas. But still, Russia has repeatedly declared that it remains committed to the Minsk package of measures, and that Russia is in favor of the implementation of the entire Minsk plan as soon as possible, in the sequence that exists."" Donbas refers to the territories in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russia-backed separatist militants. Asked about the issue during the news conference with Scholz, Putin said there were ""mass and systematic violations of human rights in Ukraine and outright discrimination of Russian speaking citizens on legislative level."" Putin responded abruptly when Scholz expressed hope for a peaceful resolution in Ukraine, after recalling NATO's military intervention in response to the danger of genocide in the former Yugoslavia. ""According to our estimates, what is happening in the Donbas today is genocide,"" Putin responded. Putin has spoken repeatedly about what he describes as the violation of the rights of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine and elsewhere, and has stated that it is within Russia's rights to intervene militarily to protect them. It was not the first time he's used the word ""genocide"" to describe what he calls Russophobia or discrimination against Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. It's a term -- much like the word ""fascist"" -- that can be thrown around loosely in Russian political speech and does not necessarily imply direct comparison to internationally defined and recognized cases of genocide.",29,1.379001966486338,2.397437481992367,-1.018435515506029,26
2022-02-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/politics/russia-ukraine-politics-us-putin-diplomacy/index.html,A world on edge awaits Putin's critical move,"The world is suspended in an extraordinary moment of geopolitical limbo, on edge for a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine amid conflicting signals in Moscow, confusion in Kyiv and dire warnings from Washington. Already extreme tensions rose even further as one of the most dangerous moments in Europe since World War II stretches nerves and leaves everyone -- apart perhaps from President Vladimir Putin -- wondering what is next. On Monday, there were signs of a possible last-minute openness to a diplomatic off-ramp in the Kremlin, but the spectacle of an estimated 130,000 troops on high alert outside Ukraine's borders suggested a feint as much as a blink by Putin. And Russia announced Tuesday that some of its troops would return to their bases after completing recent drills, but stressed that major military exercises would continue. It was not immediately clear how many troops were involved, following weeks of military buildups. Still, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said signs from Moscow showed that ""diplomacy should continue."" He added: ""This gives grounds for cautious optimism. But so far, we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground."" Tuesday's developments saw confusion reigning -- not for the first time -- in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, as President Volodymyr Zelensky, a young leader facing the highest stakes, sarcastically dismissed Western projections of a possible Russian invasion on February 16. And in contrast with the foreboding signs elsewhere, couples flocked to Kyiv's bars and restaurants to celebrate Valentine's Day despite the looming threat of war. In Washington, the mood music grew even darker. While believing that Putin hasn't finally made up his mind, multiple officials suggested Russia could move against Ukraine at any moment. And one source familiar with the matter predicted an invasion was more likely this week than not -- and said Moscow could maintain its current force posture for quite some time even if it doesn't cross the border. There is a palpable sense that Russia and the West have reached a historic fork in the road. Down one route lies a return to the confrontation and tensions that prevailed for decades during the Cold War. Down the other might lie a diplomatic fudge that no key player seems able to frame given stark Russian demands. A crisis America doesn't need At a moment when many Americans are facing rising prices for basic goods and gasoline and are exhausted by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ukraine crisis seems distant and esoteric. But a Russian invasion could force up energy prices even more and rock stock markets, on which many rely for their retirements. The crisis is largely a creation of Putin and his personal and disputed version of history that holds that Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union until its breakup in 1991, should be part of greater Russia. It also stems from his deep resentment about how the Cold War ended and the admission of former Warsaw Pact nations, which had been aligned with Soviets, into NATO. In effect, Putin is holding Ukraine hostage with a demand for the withdrawal of those NATO forces from Eastern Europe -- a concession that would contradict 70 years of the West's doctrine that independent nations choose their own destinies. If America's long support for democracy and free-market capitalism is to mean anything in a new era when its power and example are being challenged by autocracies like China, it has no alternative but to stand up for Ukraine. Waiting on Putin In essence, the world was left wondering and worrying Monday what one man -- Putin -- will do next. There are plenty of reasons why the Russian leader may step back at the brink. An invasion might swiftly overcome Ukraine's forces. But the country is bigger than Germany or France and an insurgency -- perhaps supported by US weapons and funds -- could be a disaster for Russia. The sight of Russian troops being killed could further hurt Putin's declining popularity. But a burst of nationalism triggered by war abroad could boost his standing in a nation he rules with an iron fist. And Putin is not shy about wielding military might for political advantage, for instance against separatists in the Russian republic of Chechnya and in his annexation of Crimea -- in Ukraine -- in 2014. But some analysts believe that he has already achieved many of his objectives -- effectively setting back any aspirations Ukraine may have of joining NATO in the future. He has inserted Russia, disdained by many leaders as a declining power, back into the spotlight and is welcoming a parade of foreign leaders and ministers to Moscow. On Tuesday, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will visit the vastly more experienced Putin in a test of his resolve stiffened by a White House visit last week. The continuing diplomatic dance is a reason for hope that war could be avoided. But the fact that Putin has built such a massive force around Ukraine, in Russia, Belarus and in the Black Sea means that a decision not to invade may be seen as a loss of face. The former KGB officer, who was in East Germany when the Berlin Wall fell, also feels the humiliation of the Soviet collapse deeply. He seems to believe that NATO, a defensive alliance, is an offensive threat to Russia, one that may require him to build a buffer around Russian territory by invading Ukraine -- which has borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania -- all NATO members once behind the Iron Curtain. The US will not send troops to Ukraine, because it's not a NATO member. But if Putin invades, troops from the US and Russia, the world's two top nuclear powers, could soon be in close proximity in Europe, with the alarming possibility of miscalculations. Hope for diplomacy? A day that saw glimmers of hope and ended with even more chilling warnings from the United States started in Moscow, where Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had what appeared to be a scripted on-camera event. ""I must say that there is always a chance,"" Lavrov said, referring to the prospects for diplomacy. Putin had earlier asked Lavrov whether efforts to talk Russia down were ""just an attempt to drag us into an endless negotiation process that has no logical resolution."" His comment was ironic since many in the West believe this is exactly Putin's game and that talks are just a bluff until the moment is right to move on Ukraine. Still, the appearance could indicate Putin is finally seeking a diplomatic off-ramp, though NATO would never accept his demands to leave Eastern Europe. ""Signals today suggest that they may be looking at some last-minute diplomatic maneuvers,"" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN's Becky Anderson in an interview. ""I do think as Putin gets closer to pulling the trigger here, he is better understanding the costs."" Washington and its allies have threatened the most crippling sanctions ever on Russia's economy if Putin invades. Michael Bociurkiw, the former spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, also expressed tempered hope. ""It's hard to know what to believe coming out of Mr. Lavrov's mouth,"" Bociurkiw said on ""CNN Newsroom"" but added that the airing of his encounter with Putin on Russian state TV was significant. ""To me, it indicated that they're willing to hold off on a possible military solution to their Ukraine issue. There are more foreign ministers coming later in the week. ... So that was their way of saying, 'We're open to more dialogue.' "" Dark warnings from Washington Still, if US sources are to be believed, the photo op in Moscow was all for show. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Putin ""continues to add to"" his ""menu of options"" with new land, sea and air forces. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the US had closed its Kyiv embassy ""due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces."" A source familiar with the matter told CNN's Natasha Bertrand that a Russian attack on Ukraine is more likely this week than not, and if it doesn't happen on that timetable it doesn't mean that the threat has passed. Senators emerging from a briefing with national security adviser Jake Sullivan were equally pessimistic. ""This is a very dangerous situation,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters. The committee's chair, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, added: ""The forces the Russians have massed, they could launch at any point. Nothing I heard today dissuaded me from that."" Grim US rhetoric continued a trend of remarkably frank US and Western commentary on the situation based on declassified information, apparently designed both to increase pressure on Putin and to smoke out any attempt by Moscow to fake an incident as a ruse to justify an invasion. But all along, there has been a gap between Washington and Kyiv on the possibility of an invasion. Zelensky sent shock waves all the way to the US on Monday when he named February 16 a day of national unity, while referencing foreign fears of an invasion. But when CNN asked Mykhailo Podoliak, a presidential adviser, how to take his comments, he replied: ""Of course, with irony."" It seems an odd time for sarcasm. But Zelensky is a former comic actor and might feel justified in dark humor given the circumstances. This story has been updated with additional developments and reaction.",29,1.7796070195967744,3.9614658788668566,-2.1818588592700823,16
2022-02-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/world/ukraine-cyberattack-intl/index.html,Cyberattack hits websites of Ukraine defense ministry and armed forces,"A cyberattack hit the websites of Ukraine's defense ministry and armed forces, and the websites of two Ukrainian banks on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian government agencies' statements. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the hacking incident. ""It's too early to attribute"" responsibility, Victor Zhora, a deputy chairman at the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP) -- who is investigating the incident -- told CNN. The incident comes as Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops close to Ukraine's border, according to United States President Joe Biden, and as US officials warn that a fresh Russian invasion could come at any time. Russia has denied it is planning to invade Ukraine. SSSCIP identified the incident as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which floods a website with phony traffic to disrupt access to it. DDoS attacks are relatively cheap and easy to carry out. While they can be disruptive, they do not necessarily require sophistication. Ukrainian officials said that by 7:30 p.m. local time (12:30 p.m. ET) access to the websites of the banks -- PrivatBank and Oschadbank -- had been restored. CNN journalists in Ukraine reported difficulty accessing the websites of the defense agencies Tuesday night. Ukrainian government officials ""continue to monitor and cut off"" the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from which the hackers are flooding Ukrainian websites with traffic, Zhora said. DDoS attacks can be difficult to trace to their source as hackers can spoof their locations to make it seem they are in a country they are not. Matt Tait, a cybersecurity expert and former information security specialist with the UK government's signals intelligence agency, said the DDoS attack appears to ""be part of a general campaign of harassment and demoralization against the public encouraged by the Russian government."" ""That said, this is quite distinct from military/kinetic cyberattacks that might be used in direct conflict, such as to disable utilities or achieve direct military objectives,"" Tait told CNN. ""For this reason, I would urge caution in seeing this event as a direct precursor to invasion."" Russia routinely denies conducting cyberattacks. A separate cyberattack hit Ukrainian government websites last month. Ukrainian officials suggested Russian and Belarusian involvement, but investigators have not formally blamed those countries for the cyberattack.",3,7.034941008260753,1.3583486946938477,5.676592313566905,23
2022-02-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/politics/us-security-intelligence-prep-russian-hacking-threats/index.html,US security and intelligence agencies prep for potential Russian hacking threats,"Intelligence and national security agencies across the US government met on Friday to discuss how the Biden administration might respond to cyberattacks from Russia in light of the Ukraine crisis, three US officials familiar with the meeting told CNN. The meeting -- which convened officials from the White House, intelligence agencies, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies via videoconference -- underscores how the Biden administration sees cyberspace as a key front in the tensions over Russia's threat to again invade Ukraine. The focus of the meeting was how US agencies can work with companies across critical sectors of the economy to respond to potential hacking incidents, whether from criminal operations or state actors, the three officials said. One issue raised was the possibility of an uptick in ransomware attacks on US companies by Russian-speaking criminal gangs, two of the officials said. Another point of discussion was how the US can provide cybersecurity assistance for Ukraine, whose government faced a string of cyberattacks in mid-January, two of the US officials said. There's a ""specific, credible threat"" to Ukrainian infrastructure right now, but not to US infrastructure, one official told CNN. The goal is to be ready if that changes, and for federal officials to be able to respond with affected companies should any big hacks take place. The interagency meeting comes as US officials have urged companies to be on high alert for hacking threats from Russia, with the FBI surveying companies for signs of compromise. Officials from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security briefed state and local government officials Monday on potential Russian hacking threats, asking attendees to lower their thresholds for reporting unusual cyber activity, two people familiar with the call told CNN. Yahoo News first reported on the Monday briefing. Ransomware attacks from Russian-speaking hackers have hobbled US critical infrastructure companies in the past year, including an incident last year that forced major US fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline to shut down for days. Russia has historically been reluctant to crack down on cybercriminals operating from its soil -- so long as the hackers leave Russian organizations alone. But in recent weeks -- as Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border -- Russian authorities have also taken the rare step of arresting high-profile cybercriminals. White House officials believe Russia's domestic intelligence agency in January arrested the person responsible for the cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline attack. A senior administration official previously denied any connection between tensions over Ukraine and the FSB arrests. But Dmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert who is chairman of the non-profit Silverado Policy Accelerator, sees the Russian move as ""ransomware diplomacy."" It was a signal, he previously told CNN, from the Kremlin that if the US retaliates with harsh sanctions over Russian aggression in Ukraine, any semblance of US-Russia cooperation on cybercrime could disappear. A National Security Council spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""While there are not currently any specific credible threats to the U.S. homeland, we are mindful of the potential for Russia to consider escalating its destabilizing actions in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine,"" a senior administration official previously told CNN.

2022-02-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/europe/russia-ukraine-invasion-paths-map-cmd-intl/index.html,Russia has surrounded Ukraine on three sides. Here's where an invasion could be launched,"Russia has amassed more than 130,000 troops near Ukraine's border in recent weeks, according to US estimates, raising fears from Western and Ukrainian intelligence officials that an invasion could be imminent. As frantic diplomatic efforts are made to avert war, Russia announced Tuesday that some of its troops would return to base after completing recent drills on Ukraine's doorstep, but said that major military exercises would continue. Still, Western leaders and analysts are warning that Russia's military poses an immediate threat to Ukraine. If an invasion were to occur, it is not clear where it would begin. Russia has created pressure points on three sides of Ukraine -- in Crimea to the south, on the Russian side of the two countries' border, and in Belarus to the north. Here are the three fronts Ukraine and the West are watching, and the recent Russian movements detected in each. Eastern Ukraine Most attention has been paid to the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists have been in conflict since 2014. The foremost assumption of those watching Russian movements is that Moscow could boost the military might it already possesses in the region, therefore making eastern Ukraine the easiest position from which to launch an invasion. Satellite imagery obtained by CNN shows that a large base at Yelnya, which held Russian tanks, artillery and other armor, has been largely emptied, with the equipment apparently being moved much closer to the frontier in recent days. Large amounts of weaponry were moved to the base late in 2021 before disappearing -- including some 700 tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and ballistic missile launchers. Social media videos since show some of that equipment on trains and roads much further south in the Bryansk region, which is close to Ukraine. The armor and vehicles are identifiably from the same units that had pre-positioned at Yelnya. Stephen Wood, senior director at satellite imagery company Maxar, told CNN: ""It looks to me like a considerable amount of the vehicles [tanks, self-propelled artillery and other support vehicles] have departed from the northeastern vehicle park; additional armored vehicles departed from the more central vehicle park."" Meanwhile, heightened activity in the Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts, which border northeastern Ukraine, has added to concerns. ""We are seeing a massive influx of vehicles and personnel in Kursk,"" Konrad Muzyka, an expert in tracking military movements with Rochan Consulting, warned on Twitter. Phillip Karber of the Potomac Foundation in Washington, who has also studied Russian troop movements in detail, told CNN this month: ""Russia's strongest offensive formation -- the First Guards Tank Army, which is normally stationed in the Moscow area -- has moved south 400 kilometers (250 miles) and is assembling in the optimum area for a rapid armored offensive on the Khursk-Kyiv invasion route."" Belarus Concerns have also grown over a vast build-up of Russian troops in Belarus, a country closely allied to Moscow that could provide another way into Ukraine. Russia and Belarus began 10 days of joint military drills on February 10, the size and timing of which has sparked fears in the West. Moscow's deployment into Belarus is believed to be its biggest there since the Cold War, with ""an expected 30,000 combat troops, Spetsnaz special operation forces, fighter jets including SU-35, Iskander dual-capable missiles and S-400 air defense systems,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on February 3. It is also the largest exercise the Belarusian armed forces have conducted at any time of year, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed the purpose of the drills, called ""Allied Resolve-2022,"" included repelling ""external aggression."" Some fear the build-up points to a Russian plan to surge towards Kyiv from the north. One European diplomat told CNN earlier this month that the massing of forces is a ""big, big worry,"" noting this would be the missing piece that Moscow would need to launch a quick attack on the Ukrainian capital. The joint drills would also provide cover for a flanking movement through Belarus and into northern Ukraine, CSIS warns. Satellite images released by Maxar in early February appeared to show that Russia's military had advanced deployments at several locations in Belarus. The deployments are likely linked to the joint exercises, but other photographs show camps being established close to the border with Ukraine, hundreds of miles from where the exercises are taking place. Troops and equipment deployed to an area near the Belarusian city of Rechitsa -- less than 30 miles (45 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine -- appeared on February 14 to have departed, though it was not clear to where, according to the Maxar imagery. But if Russia were to focus on the Belarusian border as its entry point to Ukraine, the route would be fraught with difficulties. Russian soldiers would have to negotiate the Pinsk Marshes, also known as the Pripet Marshes, one of Europe's largest wetlands, which straddles the border between Belarus and Ukraine -- a dense, waterlogged and densely forested terrain stretching across 104,000 square miles. That region impeded Nazi forces during Operation Barbarossa, Germany's doomed invasion of the Soviet Union, in 1941. According to the Institute for the Study of War, ""the marshes can be difficult, in some places likely impossible, for mechanized forces to traverse when wet."" Crimea The peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014 would provide a natural staging ground for any new operation, but it is unclear whether Moscow would attempt to launch a move into Ukraine from Crimea. At least 60 helicopters have landed within the past few days at a previously vacant airbase at Donuzlav Lake on the northwest coast of Crimea, according to Maxar's satellite images dated February 13. The arrival of the helicopters coincides with a major Russian naval exercise in the Black Sea, involving more than 30 ships. And large deployment of troops and equipment have been observed by Maxar, which assesses that more than 550 troop tents and hundreds of vehicles have arrived north of the Crimean capital, Simferopol. A new deployment was identified by Maxar for the first time on Thursday near the town of Slavne on the northwest coast of Crimea, including armored vehicles. Those new deployments were observed on the same day that several Russian warships arrived in Sevastopol, Crimea's main port. The Russian Defense Ministry posted images Thursday of six large amphibious landing ships at the port. Ukraine's Navy responded that ""Russia continues to militarize the Black Sea Region, transferring additional landing ships to put pressure on Ukraine and the world."" Ukraine's naval forces ""are ready for development of any scenarios and provocations, to defend the country from the sea,"" it added. Any move into southern Ukraine could be aided by troops in Transnistria, the Russian-supported breakaway region of Moldova, where build-up has also been reported. CSIS analysts say Russian troops could attempt a coup de main on Odessa, a Ukrainian port city the northwest of Crimea, by ""sailing its amphibious ships straight into Odessa's port and moving directly into the city."" It calls such a move ""a high gain but also a high-risk operation."" Odessa is a well-populated city and urban combat there would favor those defending it, while Russian forces would need to eliminate Ukraine's air defenses and then link up with troops arriving from the east of the country.",14,7.0873359226686965,3.7945184447876406,3.292817477881056,0
2022-02-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/politics/biden-administration-russia-intelligence/index.html,How the Biden administration is aggressively releasing intelligence in an attempt to deter Russia,"For months, the Biden administration has fueled alarming headlines and surprised Washington with a remarkable drumbeat of official disclosures of previously classified intelligence revealing Russian moves as Moscow masses troops on the Ukrainian border. Administration officials tell CNN the disclosures have been carefully coordinated among the National Security Council, the intelligence community and other national security agencies in an effort to disrupt Russian planning, blunt the effectiveness of any ""false flag"" operations and, ultimately, deter military action. And there are signs the strategy is working, US officials say. The Biden administration believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has been caught off guard by some of the releases, according to one senior US official, and intelligence intercepts have picked up Russian military and intelligence officials grumbling about the exposure of their plans, CNN has previously reported. ""The hope is that the Russians are surprised about the allied knowledge of these things, and that they have an internal reaction,"" a senior Western intelligence official told CNN. ""Usually, what you'd expect to see would be the Russians wondering if they have a mole."" ""That's useful to make them doubt themselves. It's useful to make them question whether they can actually execute some of these plans and still have secrecy and surprise,"" this person continued. ""Sometimes, if you put enough doubt in the system, they may actually remove some competent people who they suspect of being spies who, in fact, aren't spies at all."" Although the United States has downgraded and publicized classified information in the past in service of other foreign-policy goals -- sometimes effectively; sometimes, as in the run-up to the Iraq War, disastrously -- the sheer volume of disclosures makes Biden's approach to the slow-rolling crisis notable. Clashes with the media The strategy has also led to clashes with the US media over the administration's unwillingness to show proof of its claims. The disclosures have largely come in the form of statements from agency spokesmen and officials have provided little by way of evidence -- in effect, asking reporters to report the material without confirmation. (Other media reports on the crisis, of course, have come from conventional reporting and unauthorized leaks.) ""If you doubt the credibility of the US government, of the British government, of other governments and want to, you know, find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said when challenged last week. He subsequently called the reporter in question to apologize. Last week, spokespeople for multiple US agencies said the US had intelligence showing Russia planned to release a scripted video showing staged attacks by Ukrainian forces to drum up a pretext for military action. In January, the US said it had credible information indicating Russia had prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a separate false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine. And in December, the White House released a declassified document that said Russia was planning an offensive in early 2022 involving up to 175,000 troops. Officials have also been remarkably detailed in public about the number of Russian troops they see amassed on the border -- intelligence that has been backed up by commercial satellite imagery released by private companies. ""We're not instrumentalizing the press. What we're doing is conducting a strategic communications campaign,"" the Western intelligence official said. ""Keep in mind that there are many potential audiences of these disclosures, whether they're made from the podium or they're made in a background briefing or in other formats. I would judge that the State Department was probably also trying to tell the American people that 'This is the nature of this crisis. This is what we see.' "" The tactic has some high-profile Cold War precedents. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy's administration released photographs of Soviet ballistic missiles positioned in Cuba amid the escalating crisis there, in part to convince a skeptical press corps in the US and the UK. In 2022, the goal is more operational: It's an effort to deny Russia the same element of surprise that it took advantage of in 2014, when it annexed Crimea. Many of the same US officials in government now had front row seats to the decision-making in 2014 and are ""absolutely"" responding to lessons learned from that experience, Western diplomats told CNN. In 2014, Western officials were caught flat-footed by Russia's denials that it was sending unmarked troops into the peninsula ahead of the actual assault, according to one Western diplomat. Officials told reporters on background that they were skeptical of the ""little green men"" on the ground, but did not go on the record to counter Russia's denials. The United States has long struggled to respond to Russia's use of so-called ""grayzone"" warfare tactics -- things like disinformation and false-flag operations -- which the US military historically isn't set up to carry out or counter. Intelligence officials have for decades debated how and when to make early disclosures of intelligence to disrupt those sorts of asymmetric tactics. Those discussions have only escalated as Putin's Russia has capitalized on the digital age to conduct sophisticated information warfare, current and former officials say. But the Biden administration's strategy of repeated disclosures offers one of the first sustained examples of a relatively new and untested doctrine. ""The new doctrine is the potential to use intelligence as an information operations weapon,"" said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who noted that the Obama administration had made similar disclosures after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Case-by-case basis The releases have also drawn attention because much of the information could not have been learned from satellite images alone -- which are often duplicated in public channels -- instead signaling clear US access to Russian military and intelligence channels. Satellite images offer comparatively limited insights, current and former intelligence officials note. It's impossible to glean Putin's intent from mere tank formations, which can be used as decoys. US officials are aware that Russian military doctrine explicitly embraces deception -- a concept known in Russian as ""maskirovka,"" or ""masking."" But the intelligence releases on alleged false-flag operations are also the riskiest to the United States, former officials say. ""Obviously, the downsides to doing stuff like this is, 'Is whatever source we got that from going to dry up on us?' "" Clapper said. ""That's always the risk-gain assessment that you have to do."" Another source familiar with the intelligence admitted that he has been ""personally a little surprised at how much has been publicly revealed, though I can appreciate the balance between revealing Russian schemes and burning sensitive sources and methods."" Current US officials say the decision to downgrade any one piece of information has gone through normal processes, led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and that no disclosure has been made that could expose the means by which the United States gathered the information in the first place. ""The intelligence community used its standard declassification procedures, which are in place to protect sources and methods,"" said a US intelligence official. Meanwhile, an extraordinary amount of the Russian buildup has played out in public, freeing the administration to publicly discuss the kind of hard intelligence about troop numbers and force positioning that in past confrontations would have been classified. As commercial satellites have proliferated and advanced in recent years, high-resolution photos of Russian troop and tank formations that would once have been the sole purview of government satellites are now made public by private companies like Maxar. The strategy has also been part and parcel of a larger effort by the Biden administration to share intelligence to keep its partners and allies on the same page about the nature of the threat. ""I have never seen it work like this. It is a whole-of-government approach. US officials are thinking about who should we bring into the conversation in a very proactive way,"" said a State Department official familiar with the process. ""And a lot of these conversations about intelligence sharing are happening because certain countries just do not believe what we are saying is true."" Publicly, Russia has responded by flatly denying the American reports, characterizing them as propaganda and hysteria. ""So far, all these statements have been unfounded and have not been confirmed by anything,"" Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for Putin, said after a recent disclosure. Reporters, often explicitly recalling credulous reporting of Bush administration claims of intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq War, have pressed officials to provide evidence backing up the releases. In 2003, much of the intelligence deliberately released to reporters and the global community, alleging evidence that Saddam Hussein was reconstituting a nuclear weapons program, turned out to be grievously wrong -- in part thanks to the US reliance on a single, unreliable source. A National Security Council spokesman said Tuesday that the administration cannot make any of the underlying information public ""without compromising intelligence sources and methods,"" adding that ""there is value to the public in exposing these operations and to dissuading Russia from pursuing them."" Still, Biden's disclosures have broadly earned positive reviews as a judicious and effective use of intelligence, according to sources across the US government who are familiar with the underlying information. ""I think it's a good thing to do, because by diming out the Russians, particularly if you can do it preemptively, then you may prevent that very thing from happening -- and it would appear, at least so far, that may be the case,"" Clapper said.",3,4.79214707706596,4.821925173808129,-0.029778096742169247,3
2022-02-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/europe/nato-troops-eastern-europe-map-intl-cmd/index.html,Here's where Alliance forces are deployed across Eastern Europe,"The threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine has placed heightened importance on the United States' and NATO's defenses across eastern Europe, which for decades have acted as a buffer between Russia and the West. NATO has four multinational battalion-size battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which operate on a rotational basis. Each is led by the UK, Canada, Germany or the US, and contains troops from several member countries. The alliance said last month that all four groups are ""robust and combat-ready forces."" Its Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has also said it is prepared to rapidly reinforce that presence further by sending additional forces and capabilities into the area. And the NATO deployments are supported by US troops. The US has its own bases in Lithuania and Romania, along with several in Poland. President Joe Biden last week formally approved the deployment of 3,000 more US troops to Poland, Germany and Romania, with 8,500 others personnel on heightened alert. NATO does not have any troops in Ukraine, and no plans have been announced to send troops from the alliance into the country. But although Ukraine is not a NATO member, the alliance also provides strategic-level advice to the country and has described the relationship as ""one of the most substantial of NATO's partnerships."" Other assets at NATO's disposal in the region include a missile defense system in Romania, designed to ""detect, track, engage, and destroy"" ballistic missiles in the atmosphere. A similar facility in Poland is set to become operational this year.",29,5.337648502177596,2.994143231635639,2.3435052705419572,9
2022-02-10,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/europe/russia-military-buildup-images-intl/index.html,New satellite images show continuing Russian military buildup on three sides of Ukraine,"New satellite images released by a US-based technology company appear to show continuing Russian military buildup in Crimea, western Russia and Belarus, as pressure continues to mount on Ukraine from three directions, underscoring fears that the Kremlin is planning an incursion into Ukrainian territory. In Crimea, a large deployment of troops and equipment was observed by Maxar in images collected Thursday, according to Stephen Wood, a senior director at the company. The deployment is at the formerly disused Oktyabrskoye airfield, north of the Crimean capital Simferopol. Maxar assesses that more than 550 troop tents and hundreds of vehicles have arrived at the site. Other sites in Crimea have also seen an influx of troops and equipment, including at Novoozernoye, where there have been extensive artillery deployments and training exercises. A new deployment was identified by Maxar for the first time near the town of Slavne on the northwest coast of Crimea, including armored vehicles. The new deployments in Crimea were observed on the same day that several Russian warships, including large amphibious landing ships, arrived in Sevastopol, Crimea's main port. The warships are expected to participate in scheduled naval exercises that would block off large parts of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, raising protests from Ukraine that commercial shipping routes would be choked. The Kremlin has denied that shipping routes will be blocked. The exercises are part of joint military drills by Russia and its ally Belarus, starting Thursday in Belarus' territory and expected to last 10 days. Moscow's deployment in Belarus is believed to be its biggest there since the Cold War, and the United States has expressed reservations about the buildup of Russian troops in the country, which shares a border with Ukraine. In Belarus, Maxar observed what it calls a ""new deployment of troops, military vehicles and helicopters"" at the Zyabrovka airfield near the city of Gomel, some 15 miles (25 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine. It is the first time helicopters have been seen in the area. There also appears to be a field hospital at the site. Additionally, troops and multiple battle groups remain deployed near the Belarusian city of Rechitsa -- less than 30 miles (45 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine. Previous satellite imagery had shown the establishment of tent encampments near Rechitsa. When combined with recent videos, they suggest a growing Russian presence in the area, which is some 200 miles (320 kilometers) east of where joint Russian-Belarus exercises got underway Thursday. Social media videos have shown substantial movements by Russian military units in the past few days to the east of Ukraine, around the cities of Kursk, Rostov-on-Don and Bryansk. Maxar reports what it calls ""a large deployment of troops and military forces"" that have ""recently arrived at the Kursk training area to the east of the city -- approximately 110 kilometers (75 miles) to the east of the border with Ukraine. "" ""Additional equipment continues to arrive in the area and preparations are being made to accommodate more troops and equipment,"" Maxar said. As Western nations look for diplomatic avenues to ease the crisis, US President Joe Biden urged Americans in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, warning that things could go sour very quickly. Speaking to NBC News' on Thursday, Biden said: ""It's not like we're dealing with a terrorist organization. We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly."" ""There's not"" a situation that could prompt him to send US troops to rescue Americans attempting to exit Ukraine, Biden told NBC, adding, ""that's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another."" HIs remarks came after a frosty exchange in Moscow between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. The latter described their talks as ""a dialogue of the deaf,"" while Truss warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would have ""massive consequences."" Discussion has turned to the Minsk Agreement, which was hammered out during talks in 2015 but never fully implemented, as a possible way out of the current crisis. But the Normandy Format -- a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France that has been aimingjoi to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014 -- failed to come to an agreement after nine hours of talks in Berlin on Thursday. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, despite Moscow's massive troop buildup in the region. The Kremlin is believed to have assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine's borders that Russia would need for a full-scale invasion, according to two US officials familiar with Washington's latest intelligence estimates.",29,2.369595992376446,0.8346064363053396,1.5349895560711062,0

The military drills, called ""Allied Resolve-2022,"" began in Belarus and will end February 20, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced Thursday in a statement. ""The purpose of the exercise is to work out the tasks of suppressing and repelling external aggression while conducting a defensive operation, countering terrorism and protecting the interests of the Union State,"" the statement said. Russia is also planning naval exercises that would block off large parts of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, raising protests from Ukraine that commercial shipping routes would be choked. The Kremlin has denied that shipping routes will be blocked. Moscow's deployment into Belarus is believed to be its biggest there since the Cold War, with ""an expected 30,000 combat troops, Spetsnaz special operation forces, fighter jets including SU-35, Iskander dual-capable missiles and S-400 air defense systems,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said last Thursday. The United States has also expressed concerns about the buildup of Russian troops in Belarus, a close ally of Russia. On Thursday, the top US general spoke with his Belarusian counterpart, marking the first time the two have had any official communication. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley tried to ""reduce chances of miscalculation"" in his call with Belarus Maj. Gen. Viktor Gulevich, according to a readout of the call. Milley has frequently spoken with NATO allies and European partners over the past few months. On Wednesday, he spoke with Lt. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the top Ukrainian general. It was the fourth time the two had spoken in about one month. But even as European leaders have held occasional talks with Russia, including French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the Kremlin earlier this week, most of the US engagement has been with allies and partners. Milley hasn't spoken to his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, since late-December. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, despite Moscow's massive troop buildup in the region. The Kremlin is believed to have assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine's borders that Russia would need for a full-scale invasion, according to two US officials familiar with Washington's latest intelligence estimates. On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry posted images of six large amphibious landing ships at the port of Sevastopol in Crimea, after they transited into the Black Sea earlier this week. Russia has declared a wide swath of the Sea of Azov and Black Sea unsafe as it performs missile and artillery fire exercises between February 14 and 19, the Ukrainian Naval Forces Command said in a Thursday statement shared by the Defense Ministry. ""By blocking the recommended sea lanes, the Russian Federation has made it literally impossible to navigate in these areas and allow ships to enter Ukrainian seaports, especially in the Sea of Azov, that is a clear violation of both the spirit and the conditions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea,"" it said. The planned exercises would restrict commercial traffic, warned Michael Carpenter, US ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, on Twitter. ""We see Russia escalating its brinksmanship by conducting provocative exercises along Ukraine's borders and in occupied Crimea, as well as in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. This chokes off commercial traffic in both bodies of water."" The Ukrainian Defense Ministry appealed for international help over the planned exercises off the Black Sea and Sea of Azov. ""We expect a strong response from the partners: when the Russian Federation's vessels will be not able to entry easily civilized ports, they will see the price for their impudence,"" Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in a statement. ""If there is no joint reaction from the world to these attempts of pressure, the Kremlin, and not just the Kremlin, could use such tactics around the globe,"" Reznikov said. The US Navy is increasing the presence of warships in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean amid rising concerns over the Russia-Ukraine crisis, according to a US defense official. Four US Navy Arleigh Burke-class destroyers have deployed in recent days to Europe to support NATO, the official said. Russia has denied that the exercises would block off shipping traffic. When asked to comment, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday: ""All military maneuvers and movements of Russian ships in the water area of the Black Sea are carried out in strict accordance with international regulations of maritime law."" The day before, Peskov said the military drills have scaled up as both Russia and Belarus face ""unprecedented threats"" from NATO. ""[The drills] are held regularly,"" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. ""Yes, the scale may be larger than before, but the situation is much more tense now."" Pressed further on the purpose and political meaning of these exercises, Peskov said both countries feel a growing threat from NATO. ""Yes, we can say so,"" Peskov said. ""Both Russia and Belarus are facing unprecedented threats, the nature and concentration of which, unfortunately, are now much higher and much more dangerous than before."" While Russian President Vladimir Putin is not scheduled to attend the drills, Gerasimov, the Chief of the Russian General Staff, arrived in Belarus ahead of the joint exercises, Russian state news agency TASS reported Wednesday. ""During the exercise, measures will be taken to strengthen the protection of the state border to prevent the penetration of armed groups of militants, block the channels for the delivery of weapons and ammunition, search, block, destroy illegal armed formations and sabotage and reconnaissance groups of a mock enemy,"" the Russian Ministry of Defense statement said. The drills are taking place around Belarus, including ""Domanovsky, Gozhsky, Obuz-Lesnovsky, Brestsky, Osipovichsky training grounds,"" while the ""airfields of Baranovichi, Luninets, Lida and Machulishchi are also involved,"" it wrote. Satellite images, taken Saturday, by US-based technology company Maxar showed camps being established close to the Belarusian border with Ukraine, hundreds of miles from where the exercises are taking place. More diplomacy The exercises begin as Western nations look for diplomatic avenues to ease the crisis. US President Joe Biden is expected to speak Friday with European and NATO leaders about Russia's buildup of troops near Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the plans. Biden spoke Wednesday with Emmanuel Macron about the French President's diplomatic efforts in Moscow -- after which the Kremlin poured cold water on reports that the two leaders had agreed to de-escalate the tense standoff on Ukraine's border. Press secretary Jen Psaki said she expected Biden ""will speak with a number of other European counterparts as the week proceeds."" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in an interview Thursday that a further round of talks between the countries in the so-called Normandy Format would be a ""good sign."" The Normandy Format is a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France that has been trying to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Talk has turned to the Minsk Agreement, which was hammered out during talks in 2015 but never fully implemented, as a possible way out of the current crisis. Advisers from all four countries are due to meet Thursday in Berlin to discuss tensions around Ukraine. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson met NATO's Stoltenberg in Brussels on Thursday, where the UK Prime Minister ""set out his plan to bolster UK military commitments to NATO"" by sending warships to Eastern Europe and increase the number of British fighter jets stationed in southeast Europe, ""to provide reassurance and support to allies in the region,"" according to Downing Street. ""Today I have agreed with the Secretary General a package of support to strengthen further our collective security, sending troops, planes and ships to defend NATO from north to south,"" Johnson said during a news conference. Johnson later traveled to Poland where he met Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. The leaders ""agreed that European security was vital for wider global stability and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions on the Ukrainian border,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss met in Moscow with her counterpart Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who gave a gloomy assessment of their talks. Lavrov called it a ""a dialogue of the deaf,"" saying at a joint press conference Russia was considering withdrawing non-essential diplomatic personnel from Ukraine. ""We are listening but we can't hear each other,"" he added. ""Our most detailed explanations fell on unprepared ground."" Truss in turn urged Russia to take a diplomatic route to avoid war over Ukraine. ""There is no doubt that the stationing of over 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border is directly put in place to threaten Ukraine,"" she said, noting that Russian authorities have also attempted to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine through cyberattacks and other activities. ""No one is undermining Russia's security. That is simply not true,"" Truss added. ""And it is perfectly proper for sovereign nations such as Ukraine to defend themselves and to seek defensive alliances.""",29,1.5504813114667886,3.4436725775611365,-1.893191266094348,0
2022-02-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/europe/ukraine-russia-weather-climate-intl/index.html,Experts are speculating over Russia's next move. They may want to check Ukraine's weather forecast,"Even in the 21st century, warfare is affected by weather -- and that may become a factor in any Russian offensive into Ukraine. The question on the lips of Ukrainians, and maybe Russian generals: ""Has Rasputitsa come early?"" Rasputitsa is the term for the mud of spring, when travel in Russia and Ukraine by road becomes more difficult. Usually its impact is most felt in March, as the snows begin to melt. So far, this winter has been unseasonably mild in much of Ukraine. As CNN drove from the eastern port city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzia in central Ukraine on February 1, it began to rain. The driver shrugged in disbelief. ""Should be snow,"" he laughed. In Zaporizhzia, crusted banks of snow were melting into a trickle of brown water. Even at midnight, as a shroud of mist lay over the River Dnieper, the temperature hovered at freezing. Sleet turned to drizzle and back again. Military analysts are debating whether a continuation of the mild winter might affect any plans for an offensive. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it has any intent to attack Ukraine, but more than 100,000 Russian troops are gathered close to the borders of Ukraine, along with heavy weapons, tanks and ballistic missiles. Social media videos from several areas where Russian forces are deployed -- some posted by soldiers themselves -- show soft and flooded ground, and plenty of mud. Data from Copernicus, the EU's Earth Observation program, shows that much of eastern Europe experienced well-above-average temperatures in January. Ukraine saw temperatures between 1 to 3 degrees Celsius higher than the average of the past 30 years, one of many changes that the climate crisis has brought this region. Copernicus also notes that in January, ""eastern Europe was predominantly wetter than average"" and the soil in Ukraine was wetter than normal. The combination means less frost and more mud. That's no surprise to Svitlana Krakovska, head of the Applied Climatology Laboratory at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute in Kyiv. ""What we're seeing on a long-term trajectory is a lower number of days with snow cover as well as frost nights. We definitely see much stronger warming happening here than the global average,"" she told CNN. The US assessment is that a Russian incursion would be easier if the temperature falls. ""[Russian President Vladimir Putin] is going to have to wait a little bit until the ground is frozen so he can cross,"" US President Joe Biden said at a news conference last month. At a Pentagon briefing at the end of January, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said that when Ukraine's ""high water table"" freezes, ""it makes it for optimal conditions for cross-country tract and wheeled vehicle maneuver."" US officials have said Putin would understand that he needs to move by the end of March. But Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, says that ""while frozen ground would be a 'nice to have' for Russian forces, it's not a determining factor. It's important to keep in mind that precision-guided missiles and airstrikes are not influenced by this factor."" Russian forces have substantially improved over the last decade, says Massicot. The air force has acquired better targeting and communications -- and many of its pilots have gained combat experience in Syria. ""The Russian military trains year-round so they have experience with different weather conditions."" Russian tanks -- hundreds of which now sit within reach of Ukraine's border -- are not much impeded by soft ground, though they'd likely make quicker progress over frozen ground. Even so, armor moves only as fast as its logistical tail, vehicles that could be slowed by bad weather ""if they had to go off-road for some reason,"" says Massicot. She notes that Russia has forward-deployed logistical equipment to help overcome such problems, including recovery vehicles and bridging materials. Pontoon bridges have also been observed on rail convoys traveling into Belarus since late January. Ground conditions would matter more in some places than others. Eastern Ukraine is rolling farmland, ideal tank country. But the northern border with Belarus includes thousands of square miles of bog and marsh that would impede an attacking force (as it did the Nazis in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa.) According to the Institute for the Study of War, ""The marshes can be difficult, in some places likely impossible, for mechanized forces to traverse when wet."" Much depends on the sort and scale of military operation that Russia might have in mind. In the early stages of a conflict, air and missile attacks would be more important than a surge of mechanized units. ""The skies would not be a factor for Russian precision guided cruise or ballistic missiles, or even some of their more accurate long-range artillery systems,"" says Massicot, who was formerly a senior analyst at the Pentagon on the Russian military. ""Cloud cover is especially not a factor for fixed locations like military facilities or command and control where coordinates are known."" Russia has moved a substantial number of Iskander ballistic missiles, which have a range of about 300 miles (450 kms) close to Ukraine in the last month. In the east, Ukrainian frontline positions have not moved for years; missiles and long-range artillery could target them regardless of weather -- perhaps providing a breakthrough point for Russian armor. Attack aircraft, which would be tasked with attacking Ukrainian units on the move, would need relatively clear skies. So would planes for dropping air assault troops into the conflict zone; according to defense analysts Janes, ""multiple airborne forces (VDV) units have also been identified deploying into Belarus."" A low cloud-base hinders air operations as well as satellite reconnaissance, and might blunt Russia's considerable air superiority, making for what one military analyst called ""a fairer fight."" But it's a double-edge sword. Dense cloud (and night) cover would allow the Russians to move troops forward to start-lines without being detected from above. Should the Kremlin decide to attack, a period of bad weather followed by clear skies once operations are underway would be optimal. The skies would matter to the Ukrainians too. If they opted for a highly maneuverable defense, they would require airborne intelligence provided by the US and NATO to focus limited resources on key points to blunt the Russian advance. Of course, weather conditions are not the only -- nor the major - consideration for the Kremlin. The progress (or lack thereof) of negotiations on Russia's published demands sent to the US and NATO will likely be the decisive factor. Devising some justification -- a casus belli -- for going to war would provide important messaging for a skeptical Russian public. Shaping the information war is a key part of Russian strategy. A changing climate Krakovska, an author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report published last year, says there is a clear connection between climate change and Ukraine's changing winters. That's particularly pronounced in Eastern Ukraine, where winter temperatures are around 3 degrees Celsius warmer on average than they were in the 1960s. ""Thirty years ago, we would have had snow cover, especially in [eastern Ukraine], for at least three months of the cold season, and we'd have frost nights for around five months,"" Kralovska said. ""In 2020, we didn't really have a winter at all, just a few days were under zero, and we didn't have much snow, just a little."" Russian President Vladimir Putin used to be ambivalent about global warming. Back in 2003, he even said that ""Maybe climate change is not so bad in such a cold country as ours? 2-3 degrees wouldn't hurt."" More recently he has acknowledged the damage it is doing to Russia's environment. Now it might affect his generals' calculations. The winter weather in Ukraine can be fickle, but the outlook for the rest of February in Kyiv is milder than the average, local meteorologists say, with most daytime temperatures well above freezing and the very occasional splash of sunshine. Timko, Ukraine's very own groundhog, apparently thinks the Rasputitsa mud may be a little earlier this year. He didn't see his shadow when he emerged from hibernation last week.",14,4.05323655540472,4.747749512298277,-0.6945129568935577,0
2022-02-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/europe/ukraine-russia-news-tuesday-intl/index.html,"Russia pours cold water on Ukraine crisis de-escalation, as Macron meets with Zelensky","As French President Emmanuel Macron visited his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Tuesday for diplomatic talks on the country's crisis with Russia, Moscow indicated there were ""points of convergence"" laid out by Macron during his five-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin a day earlier. But the Kremlin has poured cold water on reports that the two leaders had agreed to de-escalate the tense standoff on Ukraine's border, where tens of thousands of Russian forces have massed in recent months, drawing warnings from Western officials of an impending invasion. The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday would not confirm any tangible steps toward a resolution, casting a cloud over the French president's shuttle diplomacy as he addressed the media in a joint press conference alongside Zelensky. Macron told journalists in Kyiv that his trip to Moscow had delivered concrete solutions for stability on the European continent and that Putin said he ""would not be the cause of an escalation."" He added that the Russian president had promised to respect the Minsk agreements, a ceasefire protocol signed by Ukraine and Russia in 2015 after Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a rebellion in Ukraine's east. Despite the agreement, the two sides have not seen a stable peace. Putin on Monday insisted in no uncertain terms that Zelensky must implement the peace plan in a press conference with Macron on Monday. ""Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,"" Putin said of Zelensky. Zelensky recently stated that he does not like a single point of the Minsk agreements, which requires Ukraine to give autonomy to two Russian-backed separatist regions in the country's east. To critics, the accord could give Moscow sway over Ukrainian politics. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: ""We are not his."" As Putin tests the West's resolve, Macron has thrust himself to center stage, taking former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's place as leading mediator for Europe as he readies himself for a re-election bid at home. Currently at the helm of the European Union's rotating presidency, Macron has spoken several times per week with Putin, and placed his third phone call in a week to Biden on Sunday evening. The Elysee Palace trumpeted a list of key takeaways from Macron's meeting with Putin, including Russia's ""commitment not to take new military initiatives, which allows for de-escalation"" and that Moscow would withdraw troops from Belarus. But when asked about the statement from the French presidency, Peskov said he did not know anything about it: ""I can't comment on it, I do not quite understand what French colleagues were talking about."" And though Putin's spokesman did confirm that Russian military forces will leave Belarus once joint exercises between the two countries conclude, he did not give further specifics or a sense of the timeline for withdrawal. Ukrainian intelligence officials fear Russia could use Belarus as a ""full-fledged theater of operations,"" having ramped up its military presence from several thousand troops in January to an estimated 30,000 sometime this month. ""We are talking about allied exercises, and it is understood that upon completion of these exercises, the troops will return to their permanent bases,"" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Asked if a concrete date had been given by Putin, Peskov said, ""No."" Based on the latest US intelligence estimates, Putin has assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons it would need for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but US officials say they still don't know whether Russia's leader has decided to launch an attack. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning an incursion, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat to Russia. Speaking at the joint press conference, Zelensky said: ""We stand for the de-occupation of our territory."" He added that the talks with Macron were ""fruitful."" Ongoing diplomacy As Russia deploys more troops onto Ukraine's border and the US moves thousands of forces to bolster NATO's eastern front, the Kremlin's noncommittal comments on Tuesday have put a damper on another busy diplomatic day for Macron. The French President also met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday in Berlin. Macron, who in 2019 said bluntly that Europe was facing the ""brain death of NATO,"" caused by American indifference to the transatlantic alliance, and has called on the EU to take on a larger role in Europe's defense, is now getting a chance to lay out his vision for what a Europe more independent from US influence might look like. Speaking alongside Scholz and Duda, Macron told reporters that diplomatic efforts in the last few days have ""allowed the emergence of new leads"" to de-escalate the tensions between Russia and Ukraine. He said the first objective of the ongoing diplomatic efforts is to ""avoid war."" The second objective, Macron said, is to ""defend Europe and its allies"" with the third being the defense of ""principles that have made Europe in the past 30 years, in particular the respect of the sovereignty of all states, the territorial integrity, and values."" Macron also reiterated the importance of dialogue with Russia to avoid any escalation and to ""build stability and peace on the long run."" To Moscow, Macron has presented himself as a ""quality interlocutor,"" as Putin described him, according to an official in the French presidency. The stakes could not be higher. Macron is seeking to stop the massive Russian military buildup of more than 100,000 soldiers from bubbling over into war and soothe Russia's security grievances. ""No one is naive,"" Macron told reporters Tuesday. ""France, since the beginning of this crisis, has never made excessive statements on the subject, but in the same way I do not believe that this crisis can be resolved by a few hours of discussion.""",29,4.086201192785829,0.26917213414496455,3.8170290586408644,26

As the United States moves forces to Eastern Europe to support its NATO allies and Russia deploys more troops onto Ukraine's border, Macron visited his counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, in Moscow on Monday to demand a de-escalation to the crisis, before traveling to Kyiv. The two men appeared at a press conference after spending more than five hours locked in head-to-head talks. Macron said that he and Putin were able to find ""points of convergence"" over the crisis and that it was ""up to us to agree, jointly, concrete and specific measures to stabilize the situation and to de-escalate tensions."" ""There is still time to preserve peace,"" Macron said. Putin, who had sharply critical words for NATO and Ukraine, suggested ""further steps"" were possible on the diplomatic front. ""A number of his proposals and ideas, about which it is too early to speak, I consider quite possible in order to lay a foundation for our further steps,"" Putin said, adding that the pair would speak again after Macron's trip to Kyiv on Tuesday. Despite the diplomatic overtures, Putin accused Ukraine of violating the rights of its Russian-speaking population and said that its government is ""ignoring all possibilities for a peaceful resolution of the situation in Donbas,"" referring to the separatist regions in Ukraine's east. Putin has assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons it would need for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, based on the latest US intelligence estimates, but US officials say they still don't know whether Russia's leader has decided to launch an attack. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning an incursion, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat to Russia. Macron praised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's ""sangfroid"" on Monday, saying that he has shown ""self-restraint"" in the face of growing Russian military activity on its borders. ""President Zelensky is the president of a country on whose borders there are 120,000 Russian troops, and I would say that that would make one worry,"" Macron said. The crunch talks between Putin and Macron came as US President Joe Biden met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Washington, DC on Monday. Ukraine was top of the agenda, Biden said. The US President said that the two leaders ""developed a strong package of sanctions that clearly demonstrate international resolve and impose swift and severe consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's sovereignty,"" warning that ""it cannot be business and usual if Russia invades."" While the Biden administration has sought to demonstrate a united Western front against Putin's aggression, Scholz has largely watched from the sidelines as the crisis escalates -- drawing criticism and questions over Germany's willingness to confront Moscow. On Monday, one key sticking point between the US and Germany appeared to remain: the future of the contentious Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is meant to bring natural gas from Russia to Germany. Biden was explicit the project wouldn't go forward if Russia invades Ukraine, however Scholz refused to even name the project during a news conference, and declined to commit to ending the pipeline if an invasion moves ahead. Scholz, who succeeded Angela Merkel in December, has, so far, taken a softer approach on Russia than the US and its allies. Germany has not joined the US, France, Spain and other allies in bolstering troops along NATO's eastern flank. It has also been reluctant to provide lethal aid, refusing to allow NATO ally, Estonia, to send German-made howitzers to Ukraine and drawing mockery for sending thousands of helmets instead of weapons. Some experts have suggested that the pipeline project may be the reason why it's not taking a more prominent role. In an apparent attempt to refute that criticism, Scholz will visit Russia and Ukraine later this month. As Putin tests the West's resolve, Macron has thrust himself to center stage, taking Merkel's place as leading mediator for Europe as he readies himself for a re-election bid at home. Currently at the helm of the European Union's rotating presidency, Macron has spoken several times per week with Putin, and placed his third phone call in a week to Biden on Sunday evening. According to a statement from the Elysee Palace, Macron and Biden agreed Sunday to capitalize on the ""positive progress"" made in the Normandy Format -- a grouping of France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia -- to bolster the Minsk agreements, a ceasefire protocol signed by Ukraine and Russia in 2015 after Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a rebellion in Ukraine's east. Despite the agreement, the two sides have not seen a stable peace. The French president, who in 2019 said bluntly that Europe was facing the ""brain death of NATO,"" caused by American indifference to the transatlantic alliance, and has called on the EU to take on a larger role in Europe's defense, is now getting a chance to lay out his vision for what a Europe more independent from US influence might look like. To Moscow, Macron has presented himself as a ""quality interlocutor,"" as Putin described him, according to an official in the French presidency. The official told reporters Friday that among Macron's agenda for the talks was to try to balance ""the new order of security in Europe, including guarantees of regional security and the role and capacity of the European Union in taking charge of its own security,"" alongside his commitments to the US and NATO. The stakes could not be higher. Macron is seeking to stop the massive Russian military buildup of more than 100,000 soldiers from bubbling over into war and soothe Russia's security grievances, which include demands that Ukraine and Georgia be blocked from ever becoming members of the alliance and a drawdown of troops in the region. ""I'm reasonably optimistic but I don't believe in spontaneous miracles,"" Macron told reporters on the flight to the Russian capital, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV, which was traveling with the French president. Moscow, on the other hand, had been more cautious about the planned meeting. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier on Monday the Russian government had seen ""nothing new"" in response to its security demands.

2022-02-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/europe/yelnya-russian-hardware-ukraine-border-intl/index.html,"Russia accelerates movement of military hardware towards Ukraine, satellite images show","New satellite imagery obtained by CNN shows that a large base which held Russian tanks, artillery and other armor near the Ukrainian border has been largely emptied, with the equipment apparently being moved much closer to the frontier in recent days. The base is at Yelnya, southeast of the city of Smolensk and some 160 miles from the Ukrainian border. Large amounts of weaponry were moved there late in 2021 -- including some 700 tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and ballistic missile launchers. Much of that equipment is now gone, according to radar satellite imagery acquired on February 6. Cloud cover had prevented photographic imagery of the site for several days previously. The images show the tracks of departing vehicles. Stephen Wood, senior director at satellite imagery company Maxar, told CNN: ""It looks to me like a considerable amount of the vehicles [tanks, self-propelled artillery and other support vehicles] have departed from the northeastern vehicle park; additional armored vehicles departed from the more central vehicle park."" 'Entering the new stage of the build-up' Konrad Muzyka, an expert in tracking military movements with Rochan Consulting, says what has happened at Yelnya is one of several ""important changes in Russian force compositions and their locations."" He told CNN: ""We are entering the new stage of the build-up where we are seeing pre-positioned units being manned with additional personnel and that equipment is being moved probably to staging areas."" Social media videos shot in the last few days show some of that equipment on trains and roads much further south in the Bryansk region, which is close to Ukraine. The armor and vehicles are identifiably from the same units that had pre-positioned at Yelnya. ""We know that Yelnya hosts elements of the 41st army of the CMD [Russia's Central Military District] that arrived from Siberia last spring to a training ground near Voronezh and whose vehicles were later moved to Yelnya,"" Russian journalist Rusland Leviev of the Conflict Investigation Team (CIT), a Russian open-source intelligence group, told CNN. Social media videos around Bryansk show military vehicles with ""76"" and ""87"" codes on their number plates which denote the CMD, he pointed out. Leviev added that the CIT believes the vehicles are moving to Bryansk, ""because we saw two videos of the same convoy in Smolensk region and then in Bryansk region to the south,"" which the group geolocated against crowdsourced dashcam footage and satellite imagery. ""We also saw videos of several trains that were posted by social media users from Bryansk region. On the carriages we could read 8-digit identification codes, which, when checked against openly accessible databases, trace the train's origins to Yelnya."" ""This is important because those vehicles previously were several hundred kilometers away from the border, and now [they] are stopping in mere dozens [of kilometers away]."" Thomas Bullock, an analyst at Janes, wrote: ""There are now multiple indicators suggesting troops have begun deploying to forward camps to join up with their prepositioned equipment."" He also added that videos posted on social media indicate that troops from Siberia, whose equipment has already been moved to sites in Smolensk and Bryansk, are in the process of deploying. A US intelligence document dated December 3, 2021 included satellite imagery showing that the site at Yelnya was empty in June -- but by November was home to five Battalion Tactical Groups, each of which contains about 1,000 troops and supporting elements. Much of the equipment belongs to the 41st Combined Arms Army, which is normally based in Russia's CMD and has its headquarters in Novosibirsk in Siberia. Muzyka says there are substantial Russian movements elsewhere. ""We are seeing a massive influx of vehicles and personnel in Kursk,"" he tweeted Sunday. Kursk is some 70 miles (100 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine. Phillip Karber of the Potomac Foundation in Washington, who has also studied Russian troop movements in detail, told CNN: ""Russia's strongest offensive formation -- the First Guards Tank Army, which is normally stationed in the Moscow area -- has moved south 400 kilometers and is assembling in the optimum area for a rapid armored offensive on the Khursk-Kyiv invasion route."" On Sunday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told ABC News: ""We believe that there is a very distinct possibility that Vladimir Putin will order an attack on Ukraine. It could take a number of different forms. It could happen as soon as tomorrow or it could take some weeks yet."" Separately US officials told CNN at the weekend that Russian President Vladimir Putin has now assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine's borders he would need for a full-scale invasion of the country. This includes a growing force in southern Belarus. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any plans for a military offensive against Ukraine.",14,5.8608071156423165,8.757259722876858,-2.896452607234542,0
2022-02-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/politics/homeland-security-terrorism-bulletin/index.html,DHS updates terrorism bulletin in the wake of recent violent events and Russia-Ukraine tensions,"The spread of conspiracy theories and disinformation is fueling the ""heightened threat"" environment in the United States, warns the latest national bulletin issued Monday by the Department of Homeland Security. The terrorism bulletin is in part a response to recent events, including a hostage attack on a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, and threats directed at historically black colleges and universities, as well as a shift in Russian influence campaigns related to Ukraine. This bulletin ""outlines the key factors that have increased the volatility, unpredictability, and complexity of the current threat environment, and highlights resources for individuals and communities to stay safe,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. For example, supporters of foreign terrorist organizations have encouraged copycat attacks following the attack last month on the synagogue in Texas, the bulletin says. And ISIS or its affiliates ""may issue public calls for retaliation due to the strike that recently killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi,"" according to the bulletin. The National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin is the principal way DHS informs the public about any changes to the terrorism landscape in the US. The last one, issued in November, was set to expire this week. Threats against the United States are increasingly unpredictable and complex amid a host of conspiracy theories, foreign interference and calls for violence, the new DHS bulletin says. Although Russia is not named in the bulletin, a senior DHS official said it is ""one of those foreign hostile powers that has engaged in a sustained level of information influence operations targeting the US."" Those efforts have in part been aimed at undermining credibility in the US government, the official added. Russia has promoted content through various means to US populations, particularly focusing on government response to Covid-19 and issues of race and immigration, as well as the 2020 election, according to the official. However, in recent months Russia has included messaging about Ukraine, according to a law enforcement source and a DHS memo that was shared with state and local officials in late January. Since September, Russia has also promoted narratives pointing to the US as the aggressor that is exacerbating the situation between Russia and Ukraine, according to the source. ""This campaign constitutes the most significant Kremlin-driven messaging campaign in the last year and we expect this to continue to increase as the crisis over Ukraine worsens,"" reads the memo, obtained by CNN. What stands out in Monday's bulletin, according to Thomas Warrick, director of the Atlantic Council's Future of DHS Project, is the emphasis on false and misleading narratives and conspiracy theories, originating with or amplified by foreign and domestic threat actors. ""Most notable in recent months have been Russian disinformation efforts relating to Ukraine,"" he said, adding that DHS and US intelligence officials have previously pointed to state actors Russia, China and Iran, as well as terrorist groups, for their efforts to mislead and confuse the US public. ""What is most important, as the DHS NTAS Bulletin advises, is for the American people to recognize that hostile nation-states and terrorist groups alike are trying to mislead the American people on a wide range of issues,"" he said. Last month, a 44-year-old British national held four people hostage at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas. All the hostages escaped and the attacker was killed after an hours-long standoff that prompted federal government outreach to Jewish communities across the US. The synagogue attack highlights the continuing threat of violence based on racial or religious motivations, as well as threats against faith-based organizations, the bulletin says. During and after Colleyville, DHS began seeing content posted online pointing to the attack ""as an example of the types of activities that lone offenders or others should be taking ... in support of ISIS or al Qaeda,"" the senior DHS official said. There was also an increase in calls for attacks among those who are supportive of Aafia Siddiqui, an al Qaeda operative who is in custody in Texas, and the hostage taker referenced, according to the official. Investigators believe the hostage taker may have been motivated by a desire to release Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year sentence, CNN previously reported. ""Ironically,"" the official said, there have also been calls on White supremacist platforms ""noting the events in Colleyville."" The primary terrorism threat to the US continues to be from lone offenders or small groups who are motivated by a range of foreign and domestic grievances ""often cultivated through the consumption of certain online content,"" the bulletin says. Both the Colleyville incident and the threats against universities and colleges are examples of continued calls for violence directed at US critical infrastructure, mass gatherings, faith-based institutions, institutions of higher education, racial and religious minorities, government facilities and personnel, and perceived ideological opponents, according to the bulletin. To combat the threats, DHS has been sharing information and intelligence with state and local officials, as well as impacted communities. While we are ""very concerned about a threat environment,"" the DHS official said, ""I feel that we are much better prepared to deal with that threat as it is evolving than we were, say, a year ago."" Mayorkas has called for a ""significant enhancement"" in the funding allocated for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which provides money to organizations to invest in physical security enhancements, for example, another DHS official said. The synagogue in Colleyville was a recipient of one of these grants. This story has been updated with further details.",3,6.281691094379168,6.757579343366707,-0.47588824898753934,23
2022-02-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/europe/ukraine-chernobyl-belarus-intl-cmd/index.html,Ukrainians prepare for war at the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster,"It's a frigid Friday in Ukraine's Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, and dozens of journalists in fluorescent yellow vests are frantically elbowing each other as they vie for camera position in a town where no one has lived since 1986. Chernobyl has been abandoned since the world's worst nuclear disaster here three decades ago. But with tens of thousands of Russian troops amassing on Ukraine's border with Belarus just a few miles away, the ghost town is now playing host to security forces training for war. Ukraine is using Chernobyl to prepare for another potential cataclysm. Russian President Vladimir Putin has consistently denied that the Kremlin is planning an incursion into Ukraine. Russia's deployments in Belarus are ostensibly linked to joint exercises due to begin on Thursday. However, satellite photographs show Russian camps being established close to the border with Ukraine, hundreds of miles from where the exercises are taking place. If Russia were to invade Ukraine, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is a possible conduit to Kyiv. American and NATO officials say President Putin is steadily increasing his military presence in Belarus from 5,000 troops in January to an estimated 30,000 sometime this month. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that the deployment into Belarus is Russia's biggest since the Cold War, and many of those forces are just a two-hour drive from Kyiv. Propaganda battle The air is thick with sulfur as national guard troops clear the town of imagined enemy soldiers, firing hundreds of rounds of live ammunition into plywood cutouts in the windows of surrounding buildings. A sniper fires into an orange target high in an apartment block. A mortar is launched into a snowy clearing. An armored vehicle trundles past roadblocks to confront assailants held up in the second story of a building. More than 35 years ago, an explosion at the Vladimir Lenin Nuclear Power Plant forced a region-wide evacuation, sending radioactive fallout billowing across Europe. Thirty-one people died in the blast, while millions were exposed to dangerous radiation levels. Estimates of the final death toll from long-term health problems are as high as 200,000. Now, in training for war, Ukraine has brought the world's media along to see. Denys Monastyrsky, Ukraine's internal affairs minister, told journalists that security forces were using the Chernobyl exercises to demonstrate how far they have come in urban combat tactics since Russia annexed Crimea and pro-Russian separatists seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine nearly eight years ago. ""All these scenarios are taken and summarized from the cases that have occurred since 2014,"" Monastyrsky said. The spectacle, however, is also an attempt by Kyiv to match the glitzy propaganda effort coming out of Moscow. On the diplomatic front, Russia has repeatedly accused NATO of being the party responsible for the crisis, arguing the alliance's eastward expansion poses an existential threat. Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, is pumping out propaganda videos worthy of a Hollywood production, with tank columns driving at maximum speed across the frozen steppe and ground-attack fighters swooping into bases in southern Belarus. The exact nature of Russia's threat to Ukraine remains unclear and a point of contention. Ukrainian officials have spent much of the past few weeks playing down the US estimation that a Russian invasion could be ""imminent,"" concerned that the dire language was causing panic and destabilizing the economy. ""We have the same facts, but the different perception, or a different estimation,"" Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told CNN after watching the exercises in Chernobyl. The White House is no longer calling a potential invasion ""imminent"" due to concerns, they say, that the term suggests Putin has already made a decision to invade Ukraine. Nonetheless, Ukraine admits that Russia's military buildup in Belarus is worrying. 'Only a fool would start a war' War is far from the minds of many Ukrainians who live near the border where Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia meet. ""They've been saying 'a war is coming' for five years now,"" said one man who asked not to be named. ""Only a fool would start a war,"" he said. ""There won't be any winners."" At the Three Sisters Cafe, named for the three former Soviet republics, 64-year-old Masha pours espresso in paper cups for the weary drivers who wander in.

2022-02-06,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/06/europe/russia-military-images-intl/index.html,New satellite images show advanced Russian military deployments in Belarus,"New satellite images released by a US-based technology company appear to show that Russia's military has advanced deployments at several locations in Belarus, a move likely to concern Ukraine and NATO amid fears that the Kremlin is planning an incursion into Ukrainian territory. The deployments are likely linked to joint exercises between Russian and Belarus forces that are due to begin on Thursday. However, other photographs show camps being established close to the border with Ukraine, hundreds of miles from where the exercises are taking place. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, despite Moscow's massive troop buildup in the region. The Kremlin is believed to have assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine's borders that Russia would need for a full-scale invasion, according to two US officials familiar with Washington's latest intelligence estimates. However, it is unclear how long it would take Russian forces to ramp up further, or if they would need full capabilities in order to invade. The images from Maxar -- taken Saturday -- are consistent with recently posted social media videos showing Russian forces moving through Belarus and creating field camps within 20 miles of the Ukrainian border. Some of the imagery shows Belarus' Luninets airfield, where Russian fighter jets have deployed ahead of the exercises, dubbed Union Resolve 2022. Photographs show Russian S-400 air defense systems and Su-25 attack aircraft at the airfield. The Russian Defense Ministry released video on Saturday of the arrival of the planes at Luninets. One of the S-400 battalions has traveled from Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East, a journey of more than 5,600 miles (9,000 kilometers), according to Zvezda, a Russian Ministry of Defense publication. Other photographs from Maxar show Russian forces establishing themselves at some distance from where the exercises are planned -- including at Rechitsa, a Belarusian city about 170 miles (270 kilometers) east of Luninets close to where the borders of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine meet. The force gathered there includes tanks, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles. The images show that for the first time several tent encampments have been created at Rechitsa. That development and recent footage from the area suggest a growing Russian presence there. Videos posted to social media show Russian troops entertaining local people in Rechitsa, with music and demonstrations at an event called Two Nations, One History, One People. Several other images from Maxar show a growing Russian presence southwest of Rechitsa, and within 15 miles (25 kilometers) of the Ukrainian border, in rural areas close to the town of Yelsk. Maxar assesses the deployment near Yelsk to include short-range Iskander ballistic missiles, which have a range of about 250 miles (400 kilometers.) Analysts at IHS/Janes, a military intelligence firm, believe there are elements of at least three Russian Battalion Tactical Group at Yelsk. The massive troop buildup has caused alarm among US and European leaders. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that Moscow's deployment into Belarus is the biggest since the Cold War. One European diplomat called the massing of forces a ""big, big worry,"" noting this would be the missing piece that Moscow would need to launch a quick attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, which is less than two hours from the border of Belarus. Based on publicly available weather calculations, the optimal time for a Russian invasion would be while there is a hard ground freeze, so heavy equipment can readily move. US officials have said Putin would understand he needs to move by the end of March. The White House, however, has stopped saying a potential Russian invasion is ""imminent"" due to concerns that the term suggests President Vladimir Putin has already made a decision to invade Ukraine. ""We still don't know that he's made a decision,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week. Ukraine presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Sunday there was no evidence Russia will take ""critical steps for a full-scale invasion"" of the country, but added that Kyiv and its partners are preparing for any possible scenarios. ""The situation is completely under control. One way or another, we are not reducing the activity of diplomatic work to ensure a sustainable and full-fledged de-escalation,"" Podoliak told state media. He noted that the ""threatening concentration"" of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders remains, but stressed that it has been ""going on for several years.""",29,1.4850959586924217,2.666107811032002,-1.18101185233958,4
2022-02-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/politics/president-authority-deploy-us-troops-explainer/index.html,Here's why presidents send US troops abroad,"President Joe Biden has approved the deployment of 3,000 US troops to Poland, Germany and Romania to bolster NATO countries in Eastern Europe. The deployments, US officials have told CNN, are a show of support to NATO allies feeling threatened by Russia's buildup of troops near Ukraine's border. To be clear, there is no plan for US troops to engage Russian troops, and the White House and the Pentagon have stressed that American service members will not be entering Ukraine. ""They are moves designed to respond to the current security environment,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday, adding that these forces ""are not going to fight in Ukraine."" While the shuffling of troops marks the most significant sign yet that the US is preparing for the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, US troop movement is not unusual at all. And there are a number of options under which a president can deploy troops. Here's what you need to know: Exercises and basing The US can, and does, frequently send troops to Europe to participate in exercises with partner nations. US troops are stationed at bases across the continent, and these exercises and stations are built upon agreements with each nation individually or with a treaty alliance such as NATO. Bilateral agreements or requests These deployments are made in consultation with ally nations and with the agreement of both countries. This is the dynamic playing out now, with the US' NATO allies having asked for US troops to bolster their own defenses and to send a stronger message of deterrence to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But while NATO allies are receiving US troops, the deployment is a US deployment done in consultation with these allies -- not a NATO deployment. NATO As part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US also has commitments to come to the assistance of ally countries and to provide for the overall defense of NATO. Part of that defense entails the NATO Response Force, a multinational, 40,000-strong force. In 2014, partially in response to the Russian invasion of Crimea, NATO created the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which is part of the Readiness Action Plan for quick responses to a changing security environment. NATO has not activated the NATO Response Force -- which has also been used in disaster relief -- in regard to Russia's actions on Ukraine's border, but the Pentagon has said that it has 8,500 troops on heightened readiness in case it does. And the US and NATO have tens of thousands of other troops already in Europe to draw on for any additional deployments to Eastern European allies. Kirby said Wednesday that the troops being deployed were separate from the 8,500 US troops on heightened alert. The Pentagon is ""not ruling out the possibility that there will be more"" US troop movements in the coming days, Kirby said. In 2005, aircraft from the NATO Response Force delivered NATO relief supplies to the US in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and last August, the NATO Response Force was activated to support the evacuation of Afghans who had previously worked alongside NATO. Authorized use of military force This is the most controversial option on the list, but one that has been used repeatedly to send troops to war since the September 11 attacks. As of now, there has been no move to seek congressional authorization to use force in regard to the Russia-Ukraine tensions. The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force comprises only one long sentence. But its 60 broadly written words have helped pave the way for years of military activity. According to official documents, Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump all invoked it during their tenures. While Republicans and Democrats alike have expressed a desire to update the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorized the global war on terror, and the 2002 authorization for the Iraq War, the consensus has been bogged down amid disputes over how a new authorization would deal with the scope of the mission, time constraints and the use of US ground troops. The Constitution, meanwhile, states explicitly that only Congress has the authority to declare war, a power that has been invoked five times in US history: The War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, and World Wars I and II.",29,3.857545726642306,0.9760831880624719,2.881462538579834,4

Its engines are idle and it's already unbearably loud on the flight deck of the USS Harry S Truman. A flight director on the United States Navy carrier gestures towards the jet, giving the go ahead for a catapult like-system to sling the aircraft towards the edge of a seemingly impossibly short runway. Within seconds, it's in the air and nearly out of sight. This intricate process is one that pilots and crew on this Nimitz-class carrier -- an emblem of US military might -- repeat over and over again, with uncanny precision. And they're doing so unfazed by the circumstances of their presence in the Adriatic Sea as tensions between the US and Russia reach fever pitch. This is the first time since the end of the Cold War that a carrier strike group, which includes the Truman and five other ships escorting it (plus at least one or two submarines whose presence is never publicly acknowledged) has been under NATO command. ""This is the first time I've worked with NATO out on a carrier,"" F/A-18 fighter jet pilot Lt. Cmdr. Alex Tidei told CNN. ""It's the first time for a lot of our pilots -- so that's been a great experience,"" he added, seemingly unaffected by the tensions around him. The Truman -- which carries 90 aircraft on board, including a fleet of F/A-18s -- was on its way to the Middle East in mid-December, but the Pentagon decided to keep it in Europe as tensions began to escalate. Rear Adm. Curt Renshaw, commander of Strike Group Eight, of which Truman is a part, told CNN: ""I think it sends the message to allies that they can count on us. We're committed to our alliances or partnerships -- we're able to operate, plug and play anywhere in the world."" With the Truman near European shores, its jets can get to most of Eastern Europe in less than an hour, and its presence in the region gives NATO members like Bulgaria, Romania and Poland additional security guarantees. While US President Joe Biden has said that the US will not intervene militarily but rather impose economic sanctions if Russia further invades Ukraine, he has decided to reinforce its deterrence capabilities in Europe. On Wednesday, the Pentagon approved the deployment of additional troops to NATO's Eastern flank. ""It's totally consistent with what I told (Russian President Vladimir) Putin in the beginning,"" Biden told CNN's Kaitlan Collins Wednesday. ""As long as he's acting aggressively, we're going to make sure we reassure our NATO allies and Eastern Europe (that) we're there and Article V is a sacred obligation,"" Biden said, referencing the cornerstone of the NATO alliance: An attack against one ally is considered an attack against all. And that's what the Truman's exercises are preparing for. ""What we bring to strategic decision makers is that we are able to execute absolutely to perfection, we're able to integrate with partners,"" Renshaw said, adding: ""If at the tactical level, we're on our game, then that that allows the options that I think the senior decision makers need to do."" The Truman just wrapped a two-week-long exercise with NATO allies in the Adriatic Sea, alongside Norwegian and Turkish warships, additional vessels and aircraft from other NATO member states. According to the alliance, thousands of NATO forces were involved in the exercise. Lt. Cmdr. Jeannette Lazzaro, who flies the US Navy's E-2 Hawkeye -- an early warning aircraft that plays a key role in coordinating with NATO allies -- told CNN she's not concerned about rising tensions between the US and Russia. Still, she believes the exercises are important to ensure that the US and NATO ""are all working together."" ""If we ever do have to do anything, we are all on the same page,"" she said.",29,1.694765638429279,1.8678835558974642,-0.17311791746818517,4

US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said earlier this week that Russia had moved nearly 5,000 troops into Belarus, along with short-range ballistic missiles, special forces, and anti-aircraft batteries, with the intention of massing more than 30,000 troops near that country's border with Ukraine. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that Moscow's deployment into Belarus is the biggest since the Cold War, with ""an expected 30,000 combat troops, Spetsnaz special operation forces, fighter jets including SU-35, Iskander dual-capable missiles and S-400 air defense systems."" One European diplomat called the massing of forces a ""big, big worry,"" noting this would be the missing piece that Moscow would need to launch a quick attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, which is less than two hours from the border of Belarus. On Thursday, a top State Department official spoke with the Belarusian foreign minister ""about the concerning buildup of Russian troops in Belarus,"" and warned that Minsk would face harsh consequences if it allowed its territory to be used to launch an invasion of neighboring Ukraine. According to the US State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Karen Donfried ""reiterated concern about Russia's announced plan to bring 30,000 troops into Belarus for military exercises, particularly with more than 100,000 troops already stationed on Russia's border with Ukraine."" ""Assistant Secretary Donfried also emphasized that Belarus would face commensurate consequences as Russia if it were part of a plan to further invade Ukraine,"" the Department said. Belarusian and Russian officials have said they would conduct joint military exercises this month. Russian Ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Thursday that he didn't ""see any reason for those exercises that had been previously announced and will be conducted according to plan, to be a source of concern to anybody."" Estonian Ambassador to the US Kristjan Prikk told CNN Thursday that he thinks it is ""highly likely"" that Russia could use the exercises as a pretext to leave ""a sizable military contingent"" in Belarus. ""They may rotate this contingent, may not declare it to be permanent, but it is possible that they are going to stay there. And this is something that changes the sort of defense calculus in our region considerably,"" he said. Prikk also noted that Russia's deployment of troops and equipment to Belarus ""serves a dual purpose."" He noted that the southern part of Belarus gives Russia ""a suitable staging ground"" for threatening and potentially attacking Ukraine, noting that Russia ""can even threaten and attack Ukraine without crossing the border from Belarus."" ""With the air defense assets that they have deployed, the S-400 air defense missiles, and with the artillery and missiles...and long range artillery, they can, in fact, threaten Kyiv and some of the key vital infrastructure from Belarus,"" he said. He also noted that the other purpose ""is to signal the West, NATO and to put some military coercion to NATO by having Russian troops in great numbers right across the NATO Eastern border, the areas bordering Latvia, Lithuania and Poland."" Another European diplomat told CNN they find the buildup very concerning, both in terms of what it could mean for Ukraine but as an overall reflection that both the US and Europe ""have underestimated, not to say largely ignored, the strategic and military consequences of the Russian de facto political and military takeover of Belarus, which has been ongoing since 2020 and is now being finalized, with their joint exercise as a highly symbolic crowning event.""",29,1.6732248188922314,1.365218103962068,0.3080067149301633,4

Russian forces have moved into Belarus in the last two weeks. The Russian and Belarus defense ministries say the deployments are ahead of a major training exercise this month. The imagery was collected and analyzed by Maxar. In an accompanying note, Maxar said the deployments ""reflect an increased level of activity and readiness."" Maxar and other satellite imagery providers said they have noticed the expansion of existing Russian military training grounds and garrisons within some 150 miles of the Ukrainian border over the last few months. Some are within a few miles of the border. Maxar said the most recent images show a new phase of Russian activity. It said that previously, ""in most cases, few troops or new housing for additional personnel were observed near the deployments, suggesting that some of the units may have been pre-positioned or forward deployed."" That has begun to change. ""During the past couple of weeks, several new significant military deployments have been observed in Belarus,"" Maxar said. ""Also, troop tents/shelters for personnel have been seen at virtually every deployment location in Belarus, Crimea and western Russia, which suggests that the units are now accompanied with troops and have increased their overall readiness level."" Maxar compared images from September and late January of the same military camp at Novoozerne in Crimea. The images show a significant increase in activity, with an area of tents being erected. That implies the camp is ready to house troops, although there is no evidence of troops arriving as of now. Maxar also note that ""local military training activity (including live-fire artillery and maneuver training) has been observed in progress at numerous training areas."" The imagery shows impact craters at two training areas in Russia: Pogonovo and Persianovsky. Persianovsky is some 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the Ukrainian border. Pogonovo is some 150 miles (220 kilometers) from the border. Konrad Muzyka, a defense analyst focusing on Russia and Belarus at Rochan Consulting, an aerospace and defense consultancy, said he believes there are now between 74 and 76 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) ranged around Ukraine. Battalion tactical groups typically comprise of about 1,000 soldiers, along with support units. Muzyka says that since the first week of January, Russia has been moving its forces from the Eastern Military District -- thousands of miles away in Siberia -- to Western Russia and Belarus. ""The size of this deployment is significant, perhaps as many as 15-20 BTGs,"" Muzyka wrote in a note. He also said that Russian Ground Forces have deployed units that include Iskander short-range ballistic missiles to Belarus and parts of Russia close to Ukraine. He calculates there are at least 48 launchers near Ukraine. While Russian capabilities and movements can often be observed, the Kremlin's intentions are much more difficult to read. US President Joe Biden said last week that an invasion of Ukraine in February is ""a distinct possibility."" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said that ""it is highly likely that [President Putin] is likely to invade Ukraine."" ""There is a real threat of invasion, but we don't know what's going to happen,"" she told the BBC on January 30.

What Putin's Ukraine comments told us","The press conference that followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's five-hour meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban Tuesday was long on rhetoric but short on new facts: The Kremlin leader aired many of his longstanding grievances, but declined to point the way to an exit from the tense international standoff over Ukraine. It's a script Putin has read from before. In concluding remarks, he complained about what he characterized as NATO's history of deceptions, saying the alliance had previously promised to expand ""not an inch"" eastward. ""They said one thing, they did another,"" Putin said. ""As people say, they screwed us over, well they simply deceived us."" He also mentioned another key moment: The US decision to quit the landmark Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a decision President George W. Bush announced in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. That, too, has been a longstanding irritant for Putin: The move paved the way for the stationing of US missile-defense assets in eastern Europe. Back in 2016, Putin said the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was what spurred him to develop new strike capabilities that could defeat US missile defenses. Since then, Putin has unveiled a number of advanced weapons systems, to the consternation of the West and Washington. The other points Putin raised -- a halt to NATO expansion eastwards and the return of NATO's infrastructure in Europe to its 1997 footprint -- were also not new. On those issues, Washington and Moscow remain far apart: The US and NATO insist on an open-door policy for new members and say Russia has no veto over new membership. So what, exactly, was the takeaway? Putin has yet to give a full, formal response to the US and NATO letters sent a week ago in response to Russia's security demands, and it is unclear when a reply is forthcoming. What was striking was Putin's return to his obsession with Ukraine and his vision of its proper relationship with Russia. In his remarks, Putin insisted the aim of the US was to ""draw us into armed conflict"" over Ukraine by using the country as a springboard for NATO operations. ""Their main task is to contain the development of Russia,"" Putin said. ""In this sense, Ukraine itself is simply a tool to achieve this goal. This can be done in different ways. Draw us into some kind of armed conflict and force -- among other things -- their allies in Europe to impose the very tough sanctions against us that are being talked about in the United States today. Or draw Ukraine into NATO, set up strike weapon systems there and encourage some Banderites [Ukrainian nationalists] to resolve the issue of Donbas or Crimea by force of arms. And thus draw us into an armed conflict!"" Putin -- who published his own history paper last year outlining his belief in the unity of Russian and Ukrainian peoples -- has a thing for history. Thankfully, he spared us the lecture on the convoluted history of Ukrainian nationalism in the 1930s and 1940s. But he made one thing clear: He had yet to decide on whether to take action, military or otherwise. ""I hope that we will eventually find this solution, although it is not an easy one, and we are aware of this,"" he said. ""But what that will be, I'm not ready to say today, of course."" The initiative, in that respect, remains Putin's.",29,4.73668842193782,2.4118451876566676,2.3248432342811522,26
2022-02-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/politics/us-troops-europe-russia/index.html,US troops to deploy to Eastern Europe amid Ukraine crisis,"President Joe Biden has formally approved the deployment of 3,000 US troops to Poland, Germany and Romania, the Pentagon announced Wednesday, in a move to bolster NATO countries in Eastern Europe with tens of thousands of Russian troops amassed along Ukraine's border. The deployments to Eastern Europe, which were first reported by CNN, are a show of support to NATO allies feeling threatened by Russia's military moves near Ukraine and the threat of an invasion, US officials said. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the deployments included roughly 2,000 troops that would deploy from the United States to Poland and Germany. In addition, approximately 1,000 troops currently based in Germany were moving to Romania. Kirby said the moves, which would happen in the coming days, were not permanent and emphasized, ""These forces are not going to fight in Ukraine."" The move is the most significant sign to date that the US is preparing for the prospect of Russian President Vladimir Putin launching an invasion of Ukraine, as Russia has shown no signs of de-escalating after several rounds of diplomatic talks with the US and NATO. Biden signed off on the additional troops following a meeting on Tuesday morning at the White House with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, an official said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN's Matthew Chance in an exclusive statement later Wednesday that the ""US de facto is continuing to pump up tension in Europe."" Peskov said the deployments are ""the best proof that we, as Russia, have an obvious reason to be worried."" Biden told CNN's Kaitlan Collins Wednesday that the decision was ""totally consistent"" with what the US has told Russia throughout discussions. ""It's totally consistent with what I told Putin in the beginning,"" Biden said in a brief exchange in the White House East Room. ""As long as he's acting aggressively, we're going to make sure we reassure our NATO allies and Eastern Europe we're there and Article V is a sacred obligation."" At the same time the US was preparing to send troops to Europe, the White House said Wednesday it was no longer describing a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as ""imminent,"" suggesting the word sent an unintended message. ""I used that once. I think others have used that once. And then we stopped using it because I think it sent a message that we weren't intending to send, which was that we knew President Putin had made a decision,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. Last week, Psaki said an invasion by Russian troops of Ukraine continued to be ""imminent,"" a description that drew anger in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, disagreed, arguing the descriptions could cause panic and economic turmoil. A Ukrainian official told CNN that Kyiv welcomed the reinforcement of NATO's eastern flank, but ""hopes it will be accompanied with continued supplies of defensive weapons to Ukraine, including sophisticated air defenses."" More US troops could be deployed Kirby stressed these additional troop movements don't mean the US believes Putin has decided to invade Ukraine or any other country, but ""if he does invade Ukraine, obviously there's going to be consequences for that."" ""We want to make sure that he knows any move on NATO is going to be resisted, and it's going to trigger Article Five, and we're going to be committed to the defense of our allies,"" Kirby said. Last week, the US placed 8,500 troops in the US on heightened alert in case a NATO Response Force is called up and US forces are needed quickly. But the US and NATO have tens of thousands of other troops already in Europe to draw on for any additional deployments to Eastern European allies. Kirby said that the troops being deployed were separate from the 8,500 US troops on heightened alert. The Pentagon is ""not ruling out the possibility that there will be more"" US troop movements in the coming days, Kirby said. The US deployment to Poland consists of about 1,700 troops from an 82nd Airborne Division infantry brigade combat team based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. There are about 300 service members from the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg deploying to Germany. And the US is moving a stryker squadron of about 1,000 troops from Germany to Romania, Kirby said. The troops will operate on a bilateral basis with their host countries, since NATO has not yet activated the multinational response force. CNN reported last week that the US and a handful of allies had been in discussions to deploy thousands more troops to Eastern European NATO countries before any potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as a show of support in the face of Moscow's ongoing aggression. A Latvian diplomat told CNN Wednesday that Latvia, which borders Russia and Belarus, ""is ready and willing to host more troops from the US -- it's been a long standing topic of discussion with the Pentagon and those discussions are still ongoing."" Allies welcome announcement The announcement of US troop deployments to Poland was welcome news to Polish officials, according to a senior Polish diplomat. Polish officials had been discussing the possibility of sending more US troops to the country with their American counterparts in recent days, the diplomat said. Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau visits Washington beginning Thursday, and he will meet with White House officials and lawmakers, the Polish diplomat said. On Friday, Rau will meet Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department. Biden said last Friday that he would be moving the forces ""in the near term,"" as Russia has continued to build up forces near Ukraine, sparking fears of a renewed invasion even as diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions have continued. New satellite images showed a further expansion of Russia's military presence at multiple locations in Belarus, Crimea and western Russia. On Wednesday, the Spanish newspaper El Pais published confidential written responses that the United States and NATO sent last week to Russia, which rejected Moscow's demand to never admit Ukraine into NATO. El Pais published five pages of what it said was a US government document and four pages of what it said was a NATO document, and said both were sent to Russia on January 26. Kirby confirmed Wednesday the US written response to Russia was authentic, saying that its publication ""confirms to the entire world what we have always been saying."" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the US decision to deploy additional forces to Europe. ""This is a powerful signal of U.S. commitment, and comes on top of other recent U.S. contributions to our shared security -- including 8,500 troops at high readiness for the NATO Response Force, and the USS Harry S.

""Have you identified any efforts by known or suspected Russian [hacking groups] to test exploitation capabilities, develop new malware or otherwise prepare for cyber operations?"" the FBI asked in a January 21 request for information to US businesses obtained by CNN. The FBI told US firms to email the bureau if they had found ""any increased [cyber] activity against Ukraine or US critical infrastructure,"" including against financial, health care and energy companies. It's just one of a series of quiet preparations that US officials have made to guard against any potential hacking threats from the Kremlin should the US levy heavy sanctions on Russia for a renewed invasion of Ukraine. There haven't been any reports of specific, significant Russian hacking threats to US infrastructure. But US officials aren't taking that for granted -- given the history of Russian cyber campaigns against US organizations, including an effort a few years ago to breach energy and water firms. At least one previous Russian cyberattack in Ukraine has had global ramifications. A 2017 cyberattack that the Justice Department blamed on Russian military intelligence began by infecting a Ukrainian software provider, but spread around the world, causing billions of dollars of damage. Now, US officials are watching closely in case any US response to Russia's military build-up portends an increase in the digital threats facing US organizations. ""We have the weather forecast [of potential Russian cyber threats],"" a US official told CNN. ""Now we're trying to see if there will be any inclement weather in the form of actual cyber incidents."" In addition, top White House cyber official Anne Neuberger is in Europe this week to talk with US allies about how to support Ukraine in the event of Russian cyberattacks. Russia knows that ""disabling or destroying critical infrastructure"" through cyberattacks can pressure another country into ""ceding to Russian objectives,"" Neuberger told reporters Wednesday. ""We've been working closely with Ukrainians to harden their defenses and will continue to do so in the days ahead."" Lessons from past Russian hacking White House and federal agencies charged with cybersecurity have been on heightened alert, with officials checking in with critical infrastructure firms regularly. The departments of Energy and Treasury, and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, have in recent weeks held a series of briefings for industry executives on Russian hacking capabilities. While US officials say they are unaware of any credible and specific Russian hacking threats to the US homeland, they have told US businesses and state and local governments how that could change. Russia would consider conducting a cyberattack on the US homeland if Moscow perceived that a US or NATO response to a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine ""threatened [Russia's] long-term national security,"" the Department of Homeland Security said in a January 23 intelligence bulletin first reported by CNN. DHS analysts, however, assessed that Moscow's threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive cyberattacks on the US homeland ""probably remains very high."" The government is, to some degree, reliant on private companies to report emerging hacking threats because those companies own and operate the majority of US critical infrastructure. The concern among US officials has long been that Russian hackers could gain a foothold into industrial networks that, for example, help distribute electricity or provide other critical services. In 2018, DHS accused Russian government-backed hackers of engaging in a multi-year effort to infiltrate US energy, water and manufacturing firms. In some case, the hackers took screenshots of sensitive industrial computer systems that help operate machinery. US critical infrastructure operators have in recent years grown more aware of the threat and invested more in cyber defenses as Russian hacking groups have stayed active around the world. Rob Joyce, who heads the National Security Agency's Cybersecurity Directorate, said in September that US officials had previously ""seen evidence of [Russian] prepositioning against US critical infrastructure."" The FBI and other agencies want to know if anything new on that front is happening right now. The questionnaire the bureau sent US businesses last month asked if they were aware of any industrial control systems that had been recently compromised by Russian hackers. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the request for information. The intelligence sharing has gone both ways. Robert M. Lee, CEO of Maryland-based cybersecurity firm Dragos, told officials at the National Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in January that a foreign hacking group had probed the computer networks of US electric utilities that operate liquefied natural gas facilities, Lee told CNN. The activity, detected in December, involved ""high-level reconnaissance,"" and did not lead to any compromises, Lee said. The hacking group -- known in the cybersecurity industry as Xenotime or Temp.Veles -- developed tools used in an incident that forced a Saudi petrochemical plant to shut down in 2017, according to cybersecurity researchers. The Treasury Department in 2020 sanctioned a Russian government institute for its alleged involvement in that incident. ""Right now, the biggest concern we have are preparations for potential impacts to US utilities and industrial critical infrastructure,"" Sergio Caltagirone, Dragos' vice president of threat intelligence, told CNN. An NSA spokesperson said the agency's Cybersecurity Collaboration Center uses it expertise to ""proactively engage the defense industrial base and its service providers to disrupt ongoing nation-state threats in real-time."" What happens in Ukraine may not stay there The US effort to anticipate Russian hacking threats draws on information on the ground in Ukraine, which has had to fend off a string of cyberattacks since mid-January. One component of the hacks involved destructive malicious code that wiped data from at least two Ukrainian government agencies. The incident has been contained and not widely disruptive, but it had echoes of the 2017 cyberattack in its use of destructive computer code that was disguised as ransomware. US companies that do business in Ukraine should be wary of spillover from cyberattacks on Ukrainian networks, government and industry executives have warned. ""[D]isruptive and destructive attacks against Ukraine are likely to have broader implications, including potential impacts to organizations based outside the country,"" US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said in an intelligence assessment. Health care organizations with a presence in Ukraine -- or that work with suppliers there -- are isolating computer networks serving that part of the business to guard against potential hacking threats, according to Errol Weiss, chief security officer of the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a global cyber threat sharing group for health care providers.",3,7.583210548926571,7.6610383790784695,-0.07782783015189843,23
2022-02-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/europe/vladimir-putin-west-ignored-russia-concerns-intl/index.html,Vladimir Putin says the West has 'ignored' Russia's key concerns over Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that his government was studying the responses from the United States and NATO to his security demands related to Ukraine but that it was clear the Kremlin's main complaints ""had been ignored."" For weeks, Putin had said little publicly about the crisis sparked by Russia's buildup of tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders, which has raised fears of a possible invasion. But speaking at a Tuesday news conference following a five-hour meeting in Moscow with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Putin said: ""It is already clear -- I informed the Prime Minister about this -- that the fundamental Russian concerns were ignored. We did not see an adequate consideration of our three key requirements."" Putin added that Russia had not seen ""adequate consideration of our three key demands regarding NATO expansion, the renunciation of the deployment of strike weapons systems near Russian borders, and the return of the [NATO] bloc's military infrastructure in Europe to the state of 1997, when the Russia-NATO founding act was signed."" Putin also accused the US directly of attempting to ""draw us into armed conflict"" over the Ukraine crisis by using the country as a ""tool"" for NATO operations. He claimed that Washington's main goal is to force ""allies in Europe to impose the very tough sanctions against us,"" or ""draw Ukraine into NATO."" The US and NATO have said Putin's demands -- which include a promise to never expand eastward to countries including Ukraine -- violate NATO's open-door policy and are non-starters in negotiations. Putin did not offer any solutions on Tuesday, but did say he was open to more talks. ""I hope that this dialogue will continue,"" he said, adding: ""I hope that we will eventually find this solution, although it is not an easy one, and we are aware of this. But what that will be, I'm not ready to say today, of course."" Putin ended the news conference with a short lecture about what he characterized as NATO's history of deceptions, claiming that the alliance promised to expand ""not an inch"" eastward. ""They said one thing, they did another,"" Putin said. ""As people say, they screwed us over, well they simply deceived us."" Russian officials have repeatedly made this claim in the past; the US and NATO have denied making such promises. Putin also reiterated his opposition to the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO, and said Kyiv was attempting to retake Crimea -- the Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014 -- by military force, potentially bringing the alliance into open conflict with Russia. ""This [Crimea] is sovereign Russian territory, the question is closed for us,"" he said. ""Let's imagine that Ukraine is a NATO country and starts these military operations. Then what, we should fight against the NATO bloc? So, has anyone thought about this? Looks like no."" Diplomats from the US, Russia, Ukraine, NATO and the European Union have been engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held a phone call Tuesday. Following that call, a senior State Department official said Lavrov did not give an indication that Moscow will de-escalate from the border with Ukraine. Blinken told Lavrov that if Putin ""does not intend war or regime change,"" then it was time to pull back troops and heavy weaponry and engage in serious, diplomatic discussions, the official said. Lavrov responded that the escalation that the US was claiming was not occurring, the official said, but that it was merely Russia moving troops within its own borders. US State Department officials confirmed Monday they had ""received a written followup from Russia"" to a document of proposals the US sent to the Kremlin last week on how to defuse tensions and pave the way for further security talks in response to Russia's demands on security. On Tuesday, however, the Kremlin said that Russia had not yet sent its ""main reply"" to the US. ""There was a mix-up,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call. ""It [the Russian correspondence] regarded a different matter. The main reply on this issue hasn't been handed over, it's still being prepared."" Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a press conference alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Tuesday. Johnson accused Russia of ""holding a gun to Ukraine"" and warned that a potential invasion of Ukraine by Russia would be a ""political"" and ""humanitarian disaster."" ""The potential invasion completely flies in the face of President Putin's claims to be acting in the interests of the Ukrainian people,"" Johnson said. Zelensky said that should a war between Russia and Ukraine start it will be a ""big war in Europe,"" adding that there ""will be no occupation of any territory or city in Ukraine... but there will be a bloody tragedy if the invasion of our country starts.""",29,5.005947873703381,2.2666478180804717,2.739300055622909,26
2022-02-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/politics/cybersecurity-europe-russia-hacks/index.html,US cyber chief in Europe to hold talks on potential Russian hacks,"A senior White House official will meet with European allies this week to discuss ways to support Ukraine's digital defenses in the event of Russian cyberattacks, a senior Biden administration official told CNN. The trip to Brussels and Warsaw by Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, comes after still-unidentified hackers targeted multiple Ukrainian government agencies in January, and as US officials try to anticipate any potential shift in Russian hacking threats to US networks. Neuberger will meet with North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Union officials to discuss ""ways to enhance national and Alliance resilience in cyberspace,"" the official said, ""including deterring, disrupting and responding to further Russian aggression against Ukraine, neighboring states, and in our respective countries."" Neuberger also has meetings scheduled with Baltic, French, German and Polish officials in an effort to ensure US allies are on the same page in responding to any cyberattacks, the official said. Neuberger's visit underscores how US officials see cyberspace as a potential front in any further incursion into Ukraine by Russia, which has amassed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border. Ukrainian officials have told CNN that they expect hacking to play a role in any new military offensive. The US could respond with cyberoperations of its own should Russia conduct additional cyberattacks in Ukraine, President Joe Biden said at a January 19 press conference. Days earlier, a pair of cyberattacks targeted several Ukrainian government agencies that in some cases posted threatening messages to Ukrainians, and in other cases deleted data from government computer systems. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested Russia could be involved in the hacks, but investigators are still analyzing forensic data and have not officially laid blame for the incidents.",3,4.158019828854074,4.04672930600934,0.11129052284473406,23

""It [the Russian correspondence] regarded a different matter. The main reply on this issue hasn't been handed over, it's still being prepared."" The world might yet get a rare glimpse of Vladimir Putin's thinking on the tensions later on Tuesday. The Russian President is expected to make an appearance in front of the press in Moscow after meeting the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Diplomats from the US, Russia, Ukraine, NATO and the European Union have been engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks. On Tuesday, there is also a planned phone call between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will meet Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Putin himself has so far remained tight-lipped, making scant public remarks about the crisis, but the news conference following the meeting with Orban may offer some insight. Hungary is a member of both NATO and the European Union, but Orban has cultivated a close relationship with the Russian President. In the past, the Hungarian government has sometimes sided with Russia over Ukraine. In 2019, Budapest vetoed a joint declaration of NATO ambassadors on Ukraine, effectively blocking Ukraine's attempts at a closer cooperation with the alliance. However, as tension have risen in recent weeks, Hungary, which shares a border with Ukraine, said it was in discussions with the US about the possibility of accepting around 1,000 US and allied troops into Hungary. Meanwhile, Blinken is expected to speak with Lavrov on Tuesday, according to a State Department spokesperson. This call comes on the heels of a heated exchange between the US and Russian ambassadors to the United Nations during a Security Council meeting Monday, with the US saying Russia didn't give the answers they hoped for and Russia accusing Western UN colleagues of ""whipping up tensions and rhetoric."" Build-up of troops continues While the US and its allies continue to pressure Russia to de-escalate the situation, floating the idea of new sanctions and boosting their presence in Eastern Europe, the Pentagon said Russia has continued the buildup of forces around its border with Ukraine. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Monday that additional Russian troops moved ""in again around Belarus and around the border with Ukraine"" over the weekend, adding that Russia was also increasing its ""naval activity in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic."" ""They have put to sea more ships, they are exercising at sea, they are clearly increasing the capabilities they have at sea, should they need it,"" Kirby said. Both the added ground troops in Belarus and near the Ukrainian border as well as the Russian fleet vessels at sea are creating ""options available to Mr. Putin,"" Kirby said. Wider diplomatic efforts will also continue on Tuesday with a series of meetings involving Ukraine officials. UK Prime Minister Johnson was traveling to Kyiv Tuesday for talks with President Zelensky. In the runup to the meeting, Johnson announced £88 million ($118 million) in new funding for Ukraine aimed at helping the country achieve ""stable governance and energy independence,"" according to a statement from Downing Street. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was also scheduled to visit Ukraine on Tuesday. In a statement posted on his official Twitter account on Monday, Rutte said he spoke with the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and would speak to the French President Emmanuel Macron before his trip on Tuesday. Macron himself spoke to Zelensky and to Putin on Friday, and then again to the Russian President on Monday. A readout of the call from the Elysee Palace said Putin and Macron wished ""to continue the dialogue"" in the Normandy Format, a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France that has been trying to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014.",29,1.9553301086843389,0.5048764449635715,1.4504536637207672,26
2022-02-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/politics/blinken-lavrov-call/index.html,Call between top US and Russian diplomats doesn't ratchet down Ukraine tensions,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov did not give an indication that Moscow will de-escalate from the border with Ukraine in a call with Secretary of State Antony Blinken Tuesday, a senior State Department official said following the latest diplomatic effort between the two sides amid the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The official said the phone conversation between the two top diplomats lasted about 30 minutes and they described the tone as ""professional and fairly candid."" The call between Blinken and Lavrov came one day after a tense UN Security Council meeting where the US and Russia traded accusations over Moscow's escalations on the Ukrainian border, where Russia has massed thousands of troops. Blinken told Lavrov that if Russian President Vladimir Putin ""does not intend war or regime change,"" then it was time to pull back troops and heavy weaponry and engage in serious, diplomatic discussions, the official said. Lavrov responded that the escalation that the US was claiming was not occurring, the official said, but that it was merely Russia moving troops within its own borders. Blinken raised Russia's troops buildup in Belarus -- which US officials said could reach 30,000 by early February -- but there was not an ""extensive"" exchange on it, according to the official. Blinken reiterated the US commitment to pursuing diplomacy, officials and State Department spokesman Ned Price said, and the two top diplomats agreed they should speak again after the US receives a formal written reply from Moscow, which Putin would review. In Moscow Tuesday alongside Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Putin made his first public comments in weeks, saying that the written responses from the West had ""ignored"" Russia's main security concerns. Russia has demanded that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine and that NATO countries pull back troops and military equipment from Eastern European countries admitted to NATO since 1997, including Romania and Bulgaria. The US and NATO have said these demands violate NATO's open-door policy and are non-starters in negotiations with Moscow. 'Serious differences' According to Price's written readout of the call, Blinken ""further reiterated the US commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of all countries to determine their own foreign policy and alliances."" At a press briefing Tuesday afternoon, Price did not respond to any specific remarks made by Putin, while saying that the US remains focused on the formal response from the Kremlin that will be coming in a matter of days or weeks. ""We heard from President Putin a variety of things. I will leave it to the Kremlinologists out there, budding, professional, amateur or otherwise, to read the tea leaves and try to interpret the significance of those remarks,"" Price said. ""For our part, we don't necessarily need to do that because we know that a formal response from the Russian Federation is forthcoming. We heard that again today from Foreign Minister Lavrov."" Once the US receives the written response from Russia, they will chart the diplomatic path forward,"" Price said. The US did receive a written response from Russia on Monday, but the Kremlin said Tuesday that it was not its ""main reply"" to the US over Russia's security concerns, saying there had been a ""mix-up."" Russia's foreign ministry released the text the letter Tuesday, which it said was given to the United States, Canada and several European countries. In the letter, Lavrov wrote that the US and NATO responses to Russia's proposals ""demonstrate serious differences in the understanding of the principle of equal and indivisible security that is fundamental to the entire European security architecture."" A second senior official said that the ""continued engagement on the Russian side is evidence"" that Russia has not fully shut the door on diplomacy. ""I do think they agree that ideas in those in that non paper could be the basis for a constructive conversation about how you enhance security in Europe,"" they said. Several European diplomats told CNN they will be watching closely to see what happens on the diplomatic track in the coming weeks. Blinken spoke with top officials at NATO, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) following his call with Lavrov, and they ""agreed to continue to coordinate closely and committed to seek a diplomatic solution to prevent further aggression against Ukraine,"" according to a State Department readout. 'Holding a gun' British Prime Minister Boris Johnson traveled to Ukraine Tuesday, where he met in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. At a news conference, Johnson portrayed Russia's escalation as a threat not just to Ukraine but to all of NATO and Europe. ""Vladimir Putin is trying, by holding a gun, intimidating Ukraine, to get us to change the way we look at something that was fantastic,"" Johnson said of NATO. ""What is happening now is President Putin is trying to undermine those gains and re-draw the security map of Europe and new zones of influence. It wouldn't be just Ukraine, it would be Georgia, Moldova -- this moment is critical."" There have been some differences within NATO over how to respond in the event of Russian action in Ukraine -- which President Joe Biden alluded to at his news conference last week. Biden and Zelensky also clashed in a phone call last week over US rhetoric saying an invasion was ""imminent."" However, US officials and European diplomats have said there is broad consensus about the threat and the need to be prepared to respond in a significant way if Russia invades. One European diplomat said they ""would not use the word rift"" to describe the differences on possible sanctions between the US and its European allies. ""There are clearly differences and there are clearly national interests being looked after, all of which is was entirely predictable,"" they said. The diplomat noted that it makes sense to deliberately keep quite a bit of ambiguity in public communication about what the consequences could be, but it's a difficult balance to strike because if one is too general, then the of the threat might appear less credible to the Russian leadership. ""I think I think it wouldn't hurt to be a little bit more specific for sure,"" the diplomat said.

""Let them console themselves with saying that it is 'defensive.' It does not make things easier for us,"" Lavrov told Russia's Channel One evening show on Sunday. ""The line of defense has already come close to us."" ""It turns out each time that the line they are supposed to defend is moving further east.

2022-01-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/europe/ukraine-russia-explainer-war-threat-cmd-intl/index.html,Ukraine-Russia crisis: How soon might a war be and what would it look like?,"The Ukraine crisis is the classic case of a known unknown: We know that we don't know what Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to do as he amasses troops on the Ukrainian border. So how imminent is the threat of a full-scale war? Some fears appear to have receded slightly following key talks that included Russian and Ukrainian officials. But the Pentagon also says the Russian troop buildup continues, and President Joe Biden told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on a call Thursday that there was a distinct possibility Russia could launch an invasion in February, according to National Security Council Spokesperson Emily Horne. Zelensky, however, restated his position that the threat from Russia remains ""dangerous but ambiguous,"" and it is not certain that an attack will take place, a senior Ukrainian official told CNN. Diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis continue. Taking that into account, here's a look at how soon an invasion could happen and what it might look like. How imminent is the threat of war really? Analysts say Russia has a menu of options to attack at any moment it chooses, from shock-and-awe style air strikes to a ground invasion along a broad front. But while it has moved large amounts of military equipment into place in areas bordering Ukraine, not all the personnel needed for a ground operation are ready. ""At the moment, Russia has a lot of equipment pre-positioned along with its own border with Ukraine,"" said Janes, a global agency for open-source defense intelligence. ""(This) reduces the amount of time it requires for them to fill that area with more forces if they decide to fight because all of their heavy equipment's there."" Troops can be deployed in less than 72 hours, the agency said, since they need only be sent from their bases by plane or train across the country. Russia is also in the process of deploying ""quite a sizable formation"" in Belarus from its Eastern Military District (EMD), which extends from Russia's Pacific Coast to Siberia, Janes said. This formation, which Janes first detected moving west early this month, appears to include troops, logistics and communications resources as well as military equipment. Russia has said the force is there for a Russian-Belarusian training exercise. But according to Janes, the troops ""are essentially deploying as close to ready to go as you can be."" Judging by what has been pre-positioned on Russian soil near Ukraine's border, it considers Russia would require ""maybe a maximum of two weeks of intense movement to bring all of the pieces into position"" if it were to launch an invasion. Whether Russia would want to put large numbers of boots on the ground remains unclear, particularly given the risk of casualties. ""The important thing to realize is that (Russia) is quite wary of what it calls contact warfare,"" that is, forces fighting each on the ground, said Sam Cranny-Evans, a research analyst with the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). ""We've seen (this) in Chechnya, in Afghanistan, in Georgia and its covert deployments to Ukraine, that military losses actually do generate political pressure."" Russia could instead opt to use its very long-range intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets to target critical national infrastructure within Ukraine, such as military bases or even power plants and bridges, Cranny-Evans said. ""The goal is to either stop a contact conflict from emerging or shape the battlefield so that when one does emerge, it's much more favorable to the Russian forces,"" he said. US intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine ""as soon as early 2022."" Since then, US officials have stuck to that line. However, Ukrainian officials say the latest military intelligence suggests Russian forces are not yet prepared to stage a full-blown invasion into the country. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, a source close to the Ukrainian leadership said defense and intelligence chiefs were analyzing satellite images of Russian forces ""from US and other western agencies"" on an hourly basis, but were not yet seeing Russia ""getting into combat mode, or positioning themselves to attack."" Ukrainian intelligence assesses that the threat from Russia is ""dangerous, but not imminent,"" the source told CNN, and that if any Russian order to attack were given it would still take one to two weeks for Russian forces near the border to be ready. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba struck a similar note Wednesday, saying Russian troops could attack Ukraine at any time, as had been the case since 2014, but that its forces were not yet fully assembled. ""We can say 100 times a day invasion is imminent, but this doesn't change the situation on the ground,"" he said. ""In terms of timelines, what we've seen up until now has been very overt signaling of the intention for the ability to invade Ukraine,"" said Cranny-Evans. But the Russians are ""taking their time"" to get the final pieces into place in order to leave space for conversations which might allow them to achieve their political goals, such as installing a pro-Kremlin or even neutral leader in Kiev, without having to fight, he suggested. If it does come to an invasion, he considers that Russia could move the necessary troops into place in the space of 72 hours. ""It's the forces that Russia already has in the Southern Military District on the borders with Ukraine that would probably take on the first bit of fighting,"" Cranny-Evans said. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that it is NATO's support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- that constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. What else could influence the timeline for a potential invasion? There may also be non-geopolitical factors to take into account, such as the weather and the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing. If Putin orders his forces to invade, some analysts have speculated it would come before the spring thaw. ""The best time to do it is winter because it's going to be a mechanized advance and the mechanized divisions need hard frozen ground,"" journalist and author Tim Marshall told CNN. However, Cranny-Evans does not believe the weather would play a major role in any decision to invade. ""Russia has quite a long history of just fighting when it suits Russia. There's no real indication that it's bothered by mud,"" he said, adding that Russian forces are experienced in operating on this terrain. ""Armored fighting vehicles, particularly tracked ones, have generally very good mobility even on very soft soil, and it would have to be extremely degraded before they couldn't move on it at all."" Ukraine has a pretty good road system, he added. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman suggested this week that the Winter Olympics beginning next week in China could influence Russia's thinking. Putin plans to be there when the Games kick off and Chinese President Xi Jinping ""would not be ecstatic if Putin chose that moment to invade Ukraine,"" Sherman said. Sherman added that she suspects that ""even the people around"" Putin don't know what he will do with regards to Ukraine, but that the US sees ""every indication that he is going to use military force, sometime perhaps now and (up to the) middle of February."" A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman noted on January 14 that United Nations members had adopted an Olympic Truce resolution which urges countries to ""cease hostilities from seven days before the start of the Olympic Games until seven days after the end of the Paralympic Games."" That period would extend from January 28 to March 20. What would an invasion look like? It's hard to predict -- but recent history may give some clues. Russia has, after all, already invaded Ukrainian soil twice in the past decade. When Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 it did so on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian speakers. First, thousands of special-operations troops, dubbed ""little green men"" and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the southern peninsula. Then, within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate. Shortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known as the Donbas, declared their independence from Kiev, prompting months of heavy fighting. Russia's de facto invasion of the Donbas region ended in 2015, when a ceasefire was signed, but Russia still props up the separatist movement there. CNN global affairs analyst Michael Bociurkiw, a former spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said this week he believed Putin might choose to invade through the Donbas because he ""knows he will get away with it."" The area -- heavily damaged in places by shelling -- is wrongly regarded by some in the West as ""a territory that is dispensable,"" Bociurkiw said. ""Putin has been giving out hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to pro-Russian residents of the Donbas -- now he has an even further pretext to go in and say they need to be protected,"" he said. At its most minor, Russian action could involve ""normalizing"" the country's grip on the Donbas region by sending in Russian troops to lock down their control of the area, or even to slightly widen its buffer zone against the rest of Ukraine, said CNN's International Security Editor Nick Paton Walsh. Other analysts suggest that a narrow land corridor along the Azov Sea, through the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, could be easily achieved through an amphibious landing on the Azov Sea coast, said Paton Walsh -- although such a corridor would be hard to defend. Another option that's been mooted is a wider invasion of the country, Paton Walsh added, but this would be costly for Russia in terms of Russian lives and Western sanctions. Kuleba said Wednesday that his country was focused on ""every scenario,"" not just the threat of military invasion. ""We see a scenario of destabilization of Ukraine and that scenario is imminent, it's already taking place -- by spreading panic, by putting pressure on Ukraine's financial system, by conducting cyber attacks against Ukraine,"" the minister said. What forces does Russia have in place? According to a Ukrainian Defense Ministry intelligence assessment shared with CNN last week, Russia had more than 106,000 ground personnel near Ukraine's borders, with another 21,000 or so air and naval personnel on hand. The assessment also said Russia supports more than 35,000 rebels in eastern Ukraine and has about 3,000 of its own military personnel based in rebel territory. Moscow denies having any forces in eastern Ukraine.

2022-01-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/world/nato-explainer-intl-cmd/index.html,What is NATO and when does it act?,"As tensions rise between Russia and Ukraine, the role that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plays in the region has come into focus. NATO is a European and North American defense alliance set up to promote peace and stability and to safeguard the security of its members. It was created as the Cold War escalated and is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. The aim of the United States-led alliance was to protect Western European countries from the threat posed by the Soviet Union and to counter the spread of Communism after World War II. Here's what you need to know. Which countries are in NATO? Twelve founding countries -- the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and eight other European nations -- signed the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949, pledging to protect each other by political and military means. Over the decades since, the alliance has grown to include a total of 30 members. In alphabetical order, they are: Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Montenegro, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the UK and the US. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but has long hoped to join the alliance. This is a sore point for Russia, which sees NATO as a threat and vehemently opposes the move. Amid recent tensions with the West, Russia has asked for iron-clad guarantees that the alliance won't expand further east -- particularly into Ukraine. But the US and NATO have resisted those demands. The alliance has always had an ""open door policy,"" which states that any European country ready and willing to undertake the commitments and obligations of membership is welcome to apply for membership. Any decisions on enlargement of the alliance must be agreed unanimously. Following the end of the Cold War, NATO made it clear it would welcome expansion to the east and in 1997, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were invited to begin accession talks. Since then, more than a dozen countries from the former Eastern bloc, including three former Soviet republics, joined the alliance. Despite the major geopolitical changes since NATO's foundation, its stated purpose remains the same. The key principle underpinning the alliance is one of collective defense: ""An armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all."" What does that mean in practice? The principle of collective defense is laid out in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. It guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance can be used to protect any single member nation. This is crucial for many of the smaller countries who would be defenseless without its allies. Iceland, for example, has no standing army. Since the US is the largest and most powerful NATO member, any state in the alliance is effectively under US protection. In reality, the first and only time Article 5 has been invoked was in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US; as a result, NATO allies joined the invasion of Afghanistan. However, NATO has taken action on other occasions too. It put collective defense measures in place in 1991 when it deployed Patriot missiles during the Gulf War, in 2003 during the crisis in Iraq, and in 2012 in response to the situation in Syria, also with Patriot missiles. All three were based on requests from Turkey. Does it have its own army? No. NATO relies on its member countries contributing forces, meaning it is essentially as strong as the individual forces of each nation. It is in the interest of the entire coalition to make sure each country is putting enough resources into its defense. This has been one of the main sticking points in the alliance, with the US and the UK often criticizing other member states for not putting in their fair share. American military spending has always eclipsed other allies' budgets since NATO's founding in 1949. But the gap grew much wider when the US beefed up its spending after the 9/11 attacks. Under the NATO guidelines, each country should be spending 2% of its GDP on defense, but most countries are not reaching that target. Former US President Donald Trump was particularly vocal on this topic, demanding European countries do more and at one point even suggesting they ""repay"" the US for their past shortfalls. According to the most recent estimates from NATO, seven member states, Greece, the US, Croatia, the UK, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, Romania and France hit the 2% goal in 2021. Still, this is a significant improvement. In 2014, only the US, the UK and Greece were spending more than 2%. At that time, all member countries that were below the threshold, committed to ramp up military spending to reach the target within a decade. Most are sticking with the promise. How has the organization's remit changed over time? After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO evolved and expanded. Over the years since, its members have served as peacekeepers in Bosnia, fought against human trafficking, and been deployed to intercept refugees in the Mediterranean. The alliance is also responding to the new ways conflicts can unfold, for example by setting up a cyber defense hub in Estonia and, in 2019, recognizing space as a new operational domain. What's it doing about the Ukraine crisis? As Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border in recent weeks, NATO has sought to boost its presence in eastern member states. According to NATO, there are four multinational battalion-size battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, on a rotational basis. These battle groups are led by the UK, Canada, Germany and the US. NATO said on January 7 they are ""robust and combat-ready forces."" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance is prepared to rapidly reinforce that presence further by sending additional forces and capabilities into the area. The Biden administration has put as many as 8,500 US troops on heightened alert for a possible deployment to eastern Europe. More immediately, several NATO countries have started sending weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. The US has sent two shipments of weapons to Ukraine, including 300 Javelin anti-tank missiles, 800 bunker-busting bombs and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. The UK has supplied Ukraine with new light anti-tank weapons, and the Czech government agreed on Wednesday to donate more than 4,000 152-millimeter caliber artillery shells. NATO does not have any troops in Ukraine, and no plans have been announced to send troops from the alliance into the country. But although Ukraine is not a NATO member, the alliance also provides strategic-level advice to the country and has described the relationship as ""one of the most substantial of NATO's partnerships."" Since Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014, the alliance has launched a number of projects to support Ukraine's capacity-building in key areas, including cyber defense, logistics and the modernization of the nation's command and control. Since then it has also implemented what it said was the biggest increase in collective defense since the end of the Cold War, ramping up its presence in member states closest to Russia. Why is Germany being criticized? Berlin has come under criticism recently for its policy of not exporting weapons to crisis areas. Germany has so far refused to send arms to Ukraine, promising instead to give Kyiv a field hospital, medical training and 5,000 military helmets. Germany's complicated history means its governments have always been cautious about military spending and the idea of getting directly involved in a conflict is a difficult one to sell there. It has also been criticized for failing to reach the 2% GDP spending target, along with other countries. As Europe's largest economy, Germany is already NATO's third biggest net spender on defense. In 2021, it invested an estimated $64 billion into defense, trailing only behind the UK, which spent $72 billion, and the US which poured $811 billion into its defense -- more than twice the total amount spent by all other NATO members. The new German government has committed to increasing spending further to reach NATO's 2% goal, but it has stood firm on the issue of weapons exports. ""The German government has very clearly agreed that we will not send any lethal weapons, or arms deliveries to conflict areas because we do not want to fuel these conflicts further,"" German Defense Secretary Christine Lambrecht said Thursday. Germany hosts more than 30,000 US military forces and their families. It is also one of several NATO countries to host US nuclear weapons on its soil. The UK came to Germany's defense on the issue on Thursday, with British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace saying his country doesn't judge Germany for its decision. ""The advantage of being in NATO is there are 30 allies, so we can all assist Ukraine in our own way,"" he said. ''Obviously, the United Kingdom has taken a view that lethal aid of a tactical defensive nature is something that the Ukrainians need, but we're not sitting in judgement over other countries,'' Wallace said.",29,4.6773922878538325,3.7840457643098153,0.8933465235440172,9
2022-01-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/europe/ukraine-russia-news-thursday-lavrov-intl/index.html,"US and NATO responses fail to address Russia's main concerns, says Foreign Minister Lavrov","The written responses presented by the United States and NATO to Russia's security demands fail to address Moscow's concerns over the eastward expansion of the military alliance, Russia's Foreign Minister said Thursday as fears of a possible invasion of Ukraine remain high. ""There is no positive reaction on the main issue in this document,"" Sergey Lavrov told journalists in Moscow. ""The main issue is our clear position on the inadmissibility of further expansion of NATO to the East and the deployment of strike weapons that could threaten the territory of the Russian Federation."" Tensions between Moscow and Kyiv are at their highest in years, with a large Russian troop buildup near the shared borders of the two former Soviet republics. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning an invasion but has argued that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on its western flank. Lavrov explained the US and NATO had previously agreed within the context of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) not to expand at the expense of Russia's safety. ""We present non-verbal promises, written documents signed by the leaders of all the OSCE countries, including the President of the United States (Istanbul Declaration of 1999, Astana Declaration of 2010), our Western partners have to get out from a more serious situation,"" Lavrov explained. ""This principle is clearly stated. It has two main interrelated approaches. First, the right of every state to freely choose military alliances is recognized. Second: the obligation of each state not to strengthen its security at the expense of the security of others."" ""In other words, the right to choose alliances is clearly conditioned by the need to take into account the security interests of any other OSCE state, including the Russian Federation,"" Lavrov concluded. The Russian Foreign Minister conceded the responses by the US and NATO could lead to serious discussions but only on secondary issues. ""There is a reaction there that allows us to count on the beginning of a serious conversation, but on secondary topics,"" he said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov echoed the same concerns on Thursday, saying on the surface, Russia's prime concerns had not been addressed. He however refused to give an official definitive answer to the responses presented by the US and NATO. Peskov told journalists during a conference call that Vladimir Putin had read the written responses from both the US and NATO, but added that Russia's President and his government won't be rushing into any conclusions. ""The President already read the written responses,"" he said. ""All the papers are with the President. It will take some time to analyze them, we will not rush to any conclusions."" Russia's official response would not take long but Peskov cautioned it wouldn't happen straight away. NATO sees 'room for progress' US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the US's written response to Russia ""sets out a serious diplomatic path forward should Russia choose it."" The US has repeatedly said Putin's central demand, that the US and NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine to the alliance, is non-negotiable. Blinken declined to detail specifics presented to Moscow in the written response, but reiterated the West's public response to uphold NATO's ""open-door policy,"" rejecting Moscow's demands that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine. ""There is no change. There will be no change,"" Blinken said of US and NATO support for the alliance's open-door policy. ""We make clear that there are core principles that we are committed to uphold and defend, including Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the right of states to choose their own security arrangements and alliances,"" he added. NATO's Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday that the alliance's written response was sent in ""parallel with the United States."" Although the positions of Moscow and the alliance are ""far apart,"" the NATO chief outlined three main areas where NATO sees ""room for progress."" He asked that Moscow and NATO reopen their ""respective offices in Moscow and in Brussels."" It is unclear whether the latest diplomatic overture, which Moscow had sought, will change the course of talks between Russia and the West that have continued over the past several weeks. Russian Deputy Foreign Ministry Alexey Zaytsev told journalists Thursday that they consider the idea of war between Russia and Ukraine ""unacceptable"" adding that a discussion on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine in Paris ""was not easy"" and ended without result. He was referring to Wednesday's meeting of the so-called Normandy Format -- a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France -- that has been trying to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Zaytsev said he hoped for a different outcome when the four countries meet again in Berlin in two weeks. ""There is no alternative to the Minsk agreements,"" he said in reference to the framework for peace in the region that has repeatedly failed since it was first partially implemented in 2015. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a positive assessment of the talks, in a Thursday statement that described the discussion as meaningful. Zelensky also spoke with US President Biden on Thursday in a call that ""did not go well,"" according to a senior Ukrainian official, with disagreements resurfacing on the ""risk levels"" regarding a possible Russian attack. The White House, however, disputed the official's account, warning that anonymous sources were ""leaking falsehoods."" They did state that Biden warned Zelensky an imminent invasion is a ""distinct possibility."" On the call, which the Ukrainian official described as ""long and frank,"" Biden warned his Ukrainian counterpart that a Russian attack may be imminent, saying that an invasion was now virtually certain, once the ground had frozen later in February, according to the official. Zelensky, however, restated his position that the threat from Russia remains ""dangerous but ambiguous,"" and it is not certain that an attack will take place, the official said. Troop buildup rings alarm bells Ukrainians -- who have been at war for nearly eight years since Russia annexed Crimea and Russia-backed separatists took control of the eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Luhansk -- are desperate for reprieve from the drumbeats of war. In an opinion article published on CNN, Olesia Markovic described how the Russian troop buildup at the border was ringing alarm bells for Ukrainian society. ""People admit the uncertainty and the lack of clear emergency instructions are draining their intellectual and emotional resources, making it hard to focus on current tasks and their ability to make long-term plans,"" she writes. On Thursday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow, not Kyiv, must make concessions to defuse tensions in the region. ""The logic that Ukraine always has to make concessions in order to prevent Russia from being more aggressive... doesn't work this way,"" Kuleba told journalists during a visit to Copenhagen. ""I firmly believe that it's important for Western countries to succeed in this particular crisis, for the reasons that I mentioned, because in recent years, Russia has been attacking not only Ukraine,"" he said, pointing to Moscow using gas supplies, alleged cyberattacks and other tactics to hit the West.",29,2.414806063574041,5.468686899705283,-3.0538808361312415,26

A woman was among the dead, and doctors are ""fighting"" to save the lives of those injured, Ukraine's Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said on Facebook, where he sent his condolences to the victims' family and friends. There was no immediate sign of a motive for the shooting rampage, the interior ministry said. A commission will investigate what led to the soldier's actions, and evaluate his mental health when he was issued with a weapons permit, Monastyrsky said on Facebook. ""On my orders, a commission will be set up to investigate the circumstances that ... led to the actions of a 21-year-old serviceman, who was called up to learn how to defend the country and take care of security, not to shoot his colleagues,"" Monastyrsky added.

The announcement came after a meeting at the Elysee Palace of the so-called Normandy Format -- a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France -- that has been trying to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Tensions between Moscow and Kyiv are at their highest in years, with a large Russian troop build-up near the shared borders of the two former Soviet republics -- spurring fears that Russia could launch an invasion. Speaking after Wednesday's meeting, Moscow's chief negotiator Dmitry Kozak said the ceasefire must be observed ""unconditionally"" but that many other issues in eastern Ukraine remained unresolved. Western officials are continuing to push for a diplomatic solution to the tensions through the full implementation of the Minsk agreements -- a ceasefire protocol signed by Ukraine and Russia in 2015. ""We agreed that regardless of different discrepancies of the Minsk agreements that exist between Ukraine and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the truce in Donbas must be observed unconditionally,"" Kozak said. He added that the ""obligation"" to implement such agreements ""lies with the armed forces of Ukraine and the armed formations of the (eastern separatists) Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic."" Ukrainian negotiator Andriy Yermak said all parties were in support of a permanent ceasefire and Ukraine was ready to negotiate around the clock to prevent war and to de-escalate tensions around the border. Yermak called the renewal of the Normandy Format talks -- first held after Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea -- a ""very positive signal"" and the first such substantive agreement since the end of 2019. He called talks ""really substantial, but not an easy discussion"" and while there were still disagreements there was an interest in working through them. ""The work continues and I can tell you that Ukraine as usual is ready to negotiate, to meet 24-7. Because for us, for (Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelensky, for the entire team, the goal of stopping the war, of ending the war and returning our territories -- and today that this also includes easing the tensions -- the de-escalation around the Ukrainian border, is the priority,"" Yermak said. Kozak and Yermak said the talks would resume in about two weeks in Berlin. Russia's NATO concerns As many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Russian President Vladimir Putin order an invasion. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning an invasion but has argued that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on its western flank. On Thursday, Russia's Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev accused NATO of failing to keep its non-expansion ""promise,"" saying the alliance had moved closer to Russian borders, state news agency TASS reported. Medvedev said a process of negotiations on security guarantees is the only way to settle the current tensions between Russia, Ukraine and the West. ""They promised not to expand NATO, but didn't keep the promise,"" Medvedev said, according to TASS. ""They say that 'we did not sign anything.' But we all know well who and when granted to whom such promises, such assurances."" Medvedev added: ""Everything must be done to avoid any war."" NATO's 'open-door' policy As the Normandy Format got underway on Wednesday, the United States delivered a written response to Russia's concerns over Ukraine.

2022-01-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/us-allies-discuss-deploying-more-troops/index.html,US and allies discussing deploying more troops to Eastern Europe prior to any Russian invasion of Ukraine,"The US and a handful of allies are in discussions to deploy thousands more troops to Eastern European NATO countries before any potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as a show of support in the face of Moscow's ongoing aggression, three US officials familiar with the discussions tell CNN. Among the countries considering accepting the deployments are Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The deployments would number approximately 1,000 personnel to each country and would be similar to the forward battle groups currently stationed in the Baltic States and Poland. The US and UK are among those considering the new, pre-invasion deployments, but not all 30 NATO members are willing, according to a European diplomat. NATO allies have not been entirely on the same page about the severity of the threat, and Germany, for example, has refused to sell new weaponry to Ukraine. Therefore, the US is in discussions to send the additional forces on a bilateral basis or, as one official described it, as a ""coalition of the willing."" Broadly, the US military goal would be to ""meet the capability"" NATO allies in the region are asking for, another defense official said last week. US forces could operate, as they already do, unilaterally in Europe, but could also operate under existing NATO command structures. The possibility of deploying some forces closer to Russia's doorstep before an invasion marks a shift by the administration, which had previously been wary of the risk of further provoking Moscow. The move could be weaponized by the Kremlin as an example of the kind of aggressive NATO posture that Russia has been using to justify its buildup of forces along Ukraine's borders. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said on Monday that the US has put 8,500 troops in the US on heightened alert in case a NATO Response Force is called up and American forces are needed quickly. However, the vast majority of these forces are intended for activity supported by the full NATO alliance. The US and NATO have tens of thousands of other troops already in Europe to draw on for any additional deployments to Eastern European allies. Kirby told CNN on Tuesday that some troops are also on heightened alert ""just for our own United States purposes to see if there's a need for us to continue to reassure on a bilateral basis with some of our NATO allies over in Europe."" And President Joe Biden also said on Tuesday that he ""may be moving some of those troops in the nearer term, just because it takes time"" and because the US' eastern European allies have ""reason for concern."" President Biden was originally planning to deliver remarks to the public on the situation with Russia as early as this week, two sources said, but it is now unclear whether he will as the White House continues to try and engage with Russia diplomatically. The military planning comes as the US has become increasingly concerned that a further Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any time and on short notice. ""When we said it was imminent, it remains imminent,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a daily briefing on Tuesday. ""But again, we can't make a prediction of what decision President Putin will make. We're still engaged in diplomatic discussions and negotiations."" Ukrainian officials pushed back on Psaki's language on Tuesday, calling the situation with Russia ""dangerous"" but not ""imminent."" A source close to Ukrainian leadership said Tuesday that the defense and intelligence chiefs are analyzing satellite images of Russian forces ""from US and other western agencies"" on an hourly basis, but are not yet seeing Russia ""getting into combat mode, or positioning themselves to attack."" If any Russian order to attack is given, the source added, Ukraine believes it would still take between one and two weeks for Russian forces near the border to be ready. In its written responses to Russia's security demands, which US officials could present to the Kremlin as soon as Wednesday, the US is unlikely to allow any room for negotiation on NATO's open-door policy, which is President Vladimir Putin's central grievance. For that reason, there is some concern within the administration that Moscow will use the US response as a pretext to say diplomacy has failed.

Kuleba told reporters in Kyiv that Russian troops could attack Ukraine at any time, as had been the case since 2014 when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, but currently would not be able to mount a full offensive. ""The number of Russian troops amassed along the border of Ukraine and in occupied territories is large, it poses a threat -- a direct threat to Ukraine,"" said Kuleba. ""However, as we speak this number is insufficient for a full-scale offensive along the entire Ukrainian border. They also lack some important military indicators and systems to conduct such a large full-scale offensive,"" he added. ""We can say 100 times a day invasion is imminent, but this doesn't change the situation on the ground."" Ukraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. Kuleba told reporters that a military invasion is not the only threat to Ukraine. ""We see a scenario of destabilization of Ukraine and that scenario is imminent, it's already taking place -- by spreading panic, by putting pressure on Ukraine's financial system, by conducting cyber-attacks against Ukraine,"" he said. ""I am certain President [Vladimir] Putin would be happy to see this plan succeed so he doesn't even have to resort to military force to put Ukraine in an extremely vulnerable position."" He added: ""Priority number one today is to keep things under control, to be realistic in the assessment of immediate threat while not diminishing the threat of potential military invasion."" Earlier Wednesday, Sergiy Korsunsky, Ukraine's Ambassador to Japan, said he does not expect all-out war with Russia. ""I am optimistic. I believe that full scale war is very, very, very difficult to expect but we may see more localized conflict, unfortunately,"" Korsunsky said during a speech in Tokyo about Ukraine-Japan relations. ""But if it comes to military terms, let me tell you, we are very much ready. Our army is very well prepared. And you have a population which is very well motivated,"" Korsunsky said. ""It is an absolute nonsense to think, as some Russian analysts say, that once we see the approaching of Russian forces, there will be uprising, there will be change in the government. No way,"" he added. A source close to the Ukrainian leadership told CNN on Tuesday that the latest military intelligence suggests Russian forces are not yet prepared to stage an imminent invasion into the country. Russia will not allow 'endless discussion' Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov addressed the country's State Duma on Wednesday and repeated his desire for assurances from the US regarding security measures. Lavrov met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Geneva, Switzerland, on January 21, and Russia has submitted ""concrete requests,"" he said. Russia has asked the US and NATO for certain security guarantees, including binding pledges that NATO won't admit Ukraine or expand further east. ""We will not allow any attempts to wind up our initiative in endless discussion,"" said Lavrov on Wednesday. ""If there won't be any constructive response and the West will continue its aggressive line, then as the President said multiple times, Moscow will take appropriate response measures."" The US gave Moscow its written responses aimed at deterring a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Blinken announced Wednesday. The response was delivered in person to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan. The written document outlined areas where the US has publicly said it sees potential for progress with Russia -- arms control, transparency and stability, the top US diplomat told reporters at the State Department. The purpose of providing the response in written form -- a demand Russia has made since they put written ideas forward in December -- is to fuel the diplomacy the US hopes will deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine, State Department officials said earlier. ""We're taking this step by step, but we don't want to be the ones to foreclose the possible diplomatic solution,"" a senior State Department official told reporters after the meeting in Geneva. Blinken said in Geneva that US and Russian officials would meet again after the written proposal was sent to Russia. Later on Wednesday, Ukrainian negotiator Adriy Yermak said that all parties were in support of a permanent ceasefire and that Ukraine was ready to negotiate around the clock to prevent war and to de-escalate tensions around the border. Yermak was speaking after hourslong talks between Ukraine and Russia at the Elysee Palace in Paris under the Normandy Format -- a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. He said that the renewal of the Normandy Format talks, first initiated after the 2014 Crimea invasion, was a ""very positive signal,"" and that talks would resume in about two weeks in Berlin. Meanwhile, Kristina Kvien, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, told CNN's Sam Kiley that arms shipped to the country on Wednesday are ready to be deployed. ""We are trying to make it very clear to Russia that if they go in, it will not be easy,"" said Kvien, the US chargé d'affaires. The 300 Javelin anti-tank missiles, 800 bunker-busting bombs and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition delivered by the US ""can be deployed immediately,"" she added. ""They can be deployed to the border."" Kvien also warned Putin to expect stiff resistance from Ukrainians if Russia does invade. ""I have been here over two-and-a-half years,"" she said. ""I can tell you, Ukrainians will fight. They are patriotic, they will stand and fight."" Moscow risks being made ""an international pariah"" if it invades its neighbor, she added. ""I don't think that's necessarily a legacy you want to leave,"" she said of President Putin.",29,1.0795538744077848,0.8594249020672213,0.2201289723405635,26
2022-01-26,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/us-russia-ukraine/index.html,Blinken announces US has delivered written responses to Russia over Ukraine crisis,"The United States has given Moscow its written response aimed at deterring a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday. Blinken said the US response to Russia ""sets out a serious diplomatic path forward should Russia choose it,"" telling reporters Wednesday that he expects to have a follow-up discussion with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the coming days now that the document has been received in Moscow. The response was delivered in person to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan. The written document is intended to address concerns Moscow has publicly released and to outline areas where the US has said it sees potential for progress with Russia -- arms control, transparency and stability, the top US diplomat told reporters at the State Department. ""The document we've delivered includes concerns of the United States and our allies and partners about Russia's actions that undermine security, a principled and pragmatic evaluation of the concerns that Russia has raised, and our own proposals for areas where we may be able to find common ground,"" Blinken said. It's not yet clear whether the latest diplomatic overture, which Moscow had sought, will change the course of talks between Russia and the West that have continued over the past several weeks. US officials have said that Russia has shown no signs of de-escalation and they have warned that an invasion could be imminent as Moscow masses tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border. The US has repeatedly said Russian President Vladimir Putin's central demand -- that the US and NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine to the alliance -- is simply a nonstarter. While Blinken declined to detail specifics presented to Moscow, he said the US response reiterated the West's public response to uphold NATO's ""open-door policy"" rejecting Moscow's demands that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine. ""There is no change. There will be no change,"" Blinken said of US and NATO support of the alliance's open-door policy. ""We make clear that there are core principles that we are committed to uphold and defend, including Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the right of states to choose their own security arrangements and alliances,"" he added. The ball is now in Russia's court, Blinken said Wednesday. ""I think there are important things to work with if Russia is serious about working. And that is up to President Putin. We'll see how they respond,"" he said. 'Not a formal negotiating document' President Joe Biden was ""intimately involved"" in the US written response to Moscow, Blinken said. ""We reviewed it with him repeatedly over the last weeks, just as we were getting, as you know, comments, input, ideas from allies and partners,"" Blinken said in response to a question from CNN's Kylie Atwood. Blinken contended that the document, which was delivered Wednesday, is ""not a formal negotiating document."" ""It's not explicit proposals. It lays out the areas and some ideas of how we can together, if they're serious, advance collective security,"" he said. Blinken underscored that the US response was ""fully coordinated with Ukraine and our European allies and partners,"" and a source familiar said Ukraine had received a copy of the US document. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak told CNN Wednesday that the US response was ""the right strategy,"" adding that Russia should take the opportunity to use diplomacy to ""avoid a negative scenario."" ""The comprehensive, well-thought-out, factual, and well-argued response of the United States to Russia's demands was coordinated with Ukraine and other European partners of America,"" Podoliak said. Blinken said the document had also been shared with Congress and that he was briefing congressional leaders. He said the US would not release its document publicly, ""because we think that diplomacy has the best chance to succeed if we provide space for confidential talks."" ""We hope and expect that Russia will have the same view and will take our proposal seriously,"" Blinken said, adding, ""there should be no doubt about our seriousness of purpose when it comes to diplomacy."" However, US officials have acknowledged there is a high possibility that Russia publishes the full document after receiving it. The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed that it had received the response. ""Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia Alexander V. Grushko received US Ambassador to Moscow John Sullivan at his request,"" the ministry said in a statement. NATO also sent a written response to Moscow's security demands on Wednesday, alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. The NATO proposal was sent in ""parallel with the United States,"" he said during a news conference in Brussels, Belgium. Although the positions of Moscow and the alliance are ""far apart,"" the NATO chief outlined three main areas where NATO sees ""room for progress."" He asked that Moscow and NATO reopen their ""respective offices in Moscow and in Brussels."" ""We should also make full use of our existing military-to-military channels of communications, to promote transparency and reduce risks,"" he said. ""And look also into setting up a civilian hotline for emergency use."" Still hopes for fueling diplomacy US officials said they had decided to provide responses in writing -- a demand Russia has made since it put written ideas forward in December -- in an effort to fuel the diplomacy that the US hopes will deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""We put these ideas forward because they have the potential, if negotiated in good faith, to enhance our security and that of our allies and partners while also addressing Russia's stated concerns through reciprocal commitments,"" Blinken said Wednesday. ""We're open to dialogue. We prefer diplomacy and we're prepared to move forward where there is the possibility of communication, cooperation, if Russia de-escalates its aggression toward Ukraine, stops the inflammatory rhetoric and approaches discussions about the future security in Europe in a spirit of reciprocity,"" he said. But some allies and experts are skeptical of how much emphasis should be put on this document from the US, as it is not expected to give room for negotiation on Russia's key demands, and there is concern that Moscow will use the US response as a pretext to say diplomacy has failed. The top US diplomat acknowledged that it ""may well be right that Russia's not serious about this at all."" ""But we have an obligation to test that proposition, to pursue the diplomatic path, to leave no diplomatic stone unturned, because for sure it's far preferable to resolve these differences peacefully consistent with our principles than it would be to have renewed aggression, renewed conflict, and everything that will follow from that,"" he said. ""But the point is we're prepared either way,"" Blinken said. This story has been updated with background and further developments Wednesday.",29,0.8425288247525177,0.916818446597127,-0.0742896218446093,2
2022-01-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/25/europe/dmytro-kuleba-ukraine-interview-clarissa-ward-intl/index.html,"Ukraine 'will not accept' concessions to Russia, Foreign Minister says","Ukraine ""will not allow anyone to impose any concessions on us"" as part of efforts to de-escalate the threat of conflict with Russia, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told CNN in an exclusive interview Tuesday. Kuleba emphasized that the country would not accept any compromises aimed at placating Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid fears Russia may be planning to invade Ukraine -- something Moscow denies. ""If anyone makes a concession on Ukraine, behind Ukraine's back, first, we will not accept that. We will not be in the position of the country that picks up the phone, hears the instruction of the big power and follows it,"" said Kuleba. ""We paid a lot -- including 15,000 lives of our citizens -- to secure the right to decide our own future, our own destiny,"" he insisted. Ukraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. Kuleba said he has no doubts about the US's commitment to defending Ukraine, despite comments from President Joe Biden suggesting that a ""minor incursion"" by Russian troops might not lead to a severe response from the NATO military alliance. ""First, President Biden is personally committed to Ukraine. He knows this country, and he doesn't want Russia to destroy it,"" said Kuleba. ""Second, we heard from those US officials, speaking openly to the media, but also speaking to me and to other Ukrainian officials directly on the phone, that the United States will remain absolutely committed to slashing Russia if any type of incursion, invasion, interference takes place,"" he added. 'We have to be strong' Kuleba called the US's plan to reduce staff levels at its embassy in Kyiv, beginning with the departure of nonessential staff and family members, ""premature."" He said he respected every country's right to protect its citizens, but added that an evacuation ""spreads panic"" and plays into Putin's aim ""to destabilize Ukraine from the inside and to make us weaker without resorting to military force."" The minister said the US was ""definitely not"" overstating the threat from Russia. On Monday around 8,500 US troops were placed on heightened alert for possible deployment to Eastern Europe. Kuleba praised the decision and rejected suggestions that the move could anger Putin and escalate the crisis further. ""If we learned anything since 2014, it's that it's flawed logic to handle President Putin from the perspective: 'Let's do nothing in order not to make him angry.' This is not how it works,"" he said. ""Strength, resolve, deterrence; these are the three elements that work with Putin, he respects strength, this is the fact."" In March 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. ""We have to be smart, we have to be reasonable, but we have to be strong,"" said Kuleba. ""If he feels the slightest signs of weakness, it will only prompt him to further escalate and to resort to war. And that's what we have to avoid."" 'Space for diplomacy' Kuleba believes Putin has ""shot himself in the foot"" with the troop build-up, adding that there is very little Moscow can gain from the current situation that would save face. ""He put himself in this situation, no one else pushed him in that deadlock,"" Kuleba said. ""The set of demands put forward by Russia is designed in a way that if Russia is willing to act in good faith, there is a possibility to walk out of the negotiating room and say we made a deal."" Russia has asked the US and NATO for certain security guarantees, including binding pledges that NATO won't admit Ukraine or expand further east. Putin has emphasized that these demands are not an ""ultimatum,"" and Kuleba believes Russia is willing to talk. ""There is a space for diplomacy,"" he said.",29,1.1588700125159273,1.5049070505848348,-0.3460370380689075,4
2022-01-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/25/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-russia-china-iran/index.html,US enemies are lining up to test Joe Biden,"President Joe Biden is confronting a series of distinct but interlocking global crises and hotspots with US foes lining up to test the mettle of an under-pressure leader and their own sense that the United States is a retreating global power. Biden made the kind of fateful decision on Monday that might be more at home in the tense 1970s, putting up to 8,500 troops on alert to rush to Eastern Europe to counter the Kremlin's move to force the US away from its Western flank. But his trial of nerves with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is holding Ukraine hostage in a bid to reverse the West's expansion after the Cold War, is far from his only global headache. On the other side of the globe, a strategic ballet of military might is playing out as the US and China maneuver armadas and warplanes amid tensions over Taiwan, and other disputed territories, in a long-term duel for dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. While the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine is fixating the world right now, a future Chinese strike against the self-governing democratic island is the more likely trigger for a disastrous superpower conflict. Then there is the Middle East, from which America has been trying to extricate itself for years. US forces at a base in Abu Dhabi leapt into action early Monday, using Patriot missiles to shoot down several missiles flung at the Gulf emirate by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The emergency was a reminder that despite some hopes of renewed nuclear talks with Iran, the Islamic Republic's regional power plays are a grave risk to US personnel. And the vicious war in Yemen, prosecuted by Washington ally Saudi Arabia with terrible civilian consequences, endangers the US by association. And if Washington was tempted to forget the frightening prospect of a nuclear North Korea, its leader Kim Jong Un has other ideas. One of a string of recent missile tests by Pyongyang triggered extraordinary ground stops at some US West Coast airports, which underscored the nightmare scenario for any US President that the extreme hermit state could have the US mainland in its sights. Putting American power to the test Each of these challenges concern foreign states and nationalistic leaders making hard-eyed decisions to advance strategic goals, seeking to increase their power, expand or cement anti-democratic political systems and dominate their spheres of influence outside their own sovereign territory. They also know that with the US under pressure elsewhere, they may have an opening. Putin, for example, is well aware that Biden wants to pivot to the China threat -- so it makes sense to probe to see whether the US is distracted. Beijing, for one, would be happy for the US to get bogged down in Europe. The US probably needs China to help cool North Korea's provocations. And Russia is a key player in the Iran nuclear talks. It didn't go unnoticed in Washington that Iran, Russia and China held a third set of naval drills in the Indian Ocean last week. Since the US is, still, the world's dominant power, with allies across the globe, and the leader of the democratic bloc of nations, each thrust by one of its adversaries draws it deeper into a confrontation and preventive diplomacy. The building challenges to US authority come at a moment when there is a widespread perception abroad that Washington is not the power it was for the second half of the 20th century. Despite Biden's assurances that ""America is Back,"" the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year raised questions about US competence and commitment. US adversaries know Americans are exhausted by 20 years of war abroad, a factor that may lead some to calculate that Washington could waver on its strategic obligations for political reasons. And foreign leaders understand domestic US politics too. With a significant percentage of the country convinced Biden is illegitimate thanks to former President Donald Trump's election lies, and Republicans lambasting him as weak under Putin's challenge, there's rarely been a better time for foreign nations to test a modern President's character and stamina. The possibility that Trump, who was a four-year force for global instability, could return to office, meanwhile, has some allies doubting that the US can keep any commitments it does make. Some foreign leaders might look at events in Washington on Monday and wonder whether the stress is beginning to weigh on the President. After a White House event, Biden was asked about inflation by a Fox reporter and in a stunningly unguarded moment on an open mic, he responded: ""What a stupid son of a bitch."" The President later called the reporter to apologize. Putin's infuriating maneuvering Each of the geopolitical factors listed above are on display in Putin's challenge to the West over Ukraine as he seeks to restore some of the strategic sway once held by the Soviet Union over Eastern Europe around the symbolic 30th anniversary of his beloved empire's collapse. After massing more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border, the Russian leader made a series of demands for US concessions, including an assurance that the Kyiv government will never join NATO and for the alliance to pull back troops and armaments from ex-Warsaw Pact states that joined the West since they feared the kind of Russian resurgence that Putin is trying to engineer. Biden has responded by seeking a gradual escalation of pressure designed to convince Putin that the cost of invading Ukraine would be too high, promising sanctions that could cripple the Russian economy and cause knock-on political threats to his rule. Now, the President is mulling a reinforcement of NATO's eastern flank with possible troop deployments. The alliance on Monday announced some smaller deployments to the Baltic and Eastern European member states. For the first time since the Cold War, a US carrier strike group will be placed under NATO command in the Mediterranean for a high-level maritime exercise this week. This is all meant to project resolve, deterrence and to show that Putin's attempt to get the US out of Europe will fail. It is incumbent on Biden to show Washington has the back of its allies. If he doesn't, NATO will count for nothing. But it's a high-risk plan since US deployments could prompt the Russian leader to pull the trigger he has to Ukraine's head and to argue he must invade to protect Russian security. Putin is an infuriating, unpredictable adversary, and has forced the US to react to his provocations for weeks. It's impossible to read his intentions. US diplomacy so far, including a Biden-Putin meeting in Geneva last year and more recent online encounters between the presidents, have yielded no breakthroughs. It has, however, handed Putin the prestige of Cold War-style summits that led Republicans to accuse Biden of that dreaded word -- appeasement. In the latest demonstration of Putin's penchant for mind games, he and Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel spoke by phone on Monday and agreed to deeper cooperation. Some Russian military officials have suggested deploying military assets to Cuba and Venezuela during the crisis over Ukraine. The allusions to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 -- the US-Soviet standoff in which the world came close to nuclear war -- are hard to miss. More showdowns lie in wait for Biden Some analysts believe that Putin has put himself in a box and will be unable to exit the showdown without at least a limited penetration into Ukraine that would save face. This is why Biden whipped up so much controversy last week when he suggested that a ""minor incursion"" by Russia would not draw the full sanctions broadside. But the US President was also telling the truth, apparently referring to divisions among allies in Europe about how to handle Putin. The Russian leader's timing is no accident as he tries to probe divisions between European powers internally and with the United States over the crisis. This is a transitional period for the three major European powers. Germany has a new governing coalition that is split on foreign policy, knows it is reliant on Russian gas in the winter and remains wary of offensive military operations owing to its historic scar of militarism. French President Emmanuel Macron faces reelection in April, and is using the crisis to push for a more aggressive European Union role that might weaken US authority. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is mired in boozy scandals and struggling to cling onto power. The government in London is also locked in a bitter estrangement with its near allies over its exit from the EU. Biden made a public point of addressing divides in Europe on Monday, gathering leaders in a video call and orchestrating a series of statements on both sides of the Atlantic promising unity on the crisis and the costs that Russia could face. ""I had a very, very, very good meeting -- total unanimity with all the European leaders,"" Biden told reporters afterward. But there's reason to doubt his confidence. The European Union, for example, saw no need to follow the US in authorizing the departure of nonessential staff and family members from Kyiv. Officials on the other side of the Atlantic have not used the same kind of alarmist language as the Biden administration about the imminent threat of a Russian invasion. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Monday that though unity and pressure on Russia was vital, the situation was not irretrievable. ""Certainly, I have reason to be concerned but I don't want to go in a nervous attack,"" Borrell told Hala Gorani on CNN International. Managing different threat perceptions with Europe is just one of the challenges that Biden faces in navigating the Ukraine showdown, one of the most testing moments in the recent history of NATO. And he knows that even if he can engineer a peaceful resolution, China, North Korea and Iran are up next, posing more intractable challenges for a presidency never free from crises.",29,1.9563287596897574,5.201188631161812,-3.2448598714720545,16

2022-01-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/25/europe/nato-jens-stoltenberg-russia-ukraine-proposals-amanpour-intl/index.html,"NATO chief: Still a 'diplomatic way out' of Ukraine conflict, as military alliance prepares written proposal for Russia","NATO will send a written proposal to the Kremlin later this week to ""try to find a way forward"" amid growing tensions over Russia's troop build-up on Ukraine's border, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. ""We will outline that we are ready to sit down ... and discuss arms control, disarmament, transparency on military activities, risk reduction mechanisms, and other issues which are relevant for European security. And also to sit down and listen to Russian concerns,"" Stoltenberg said. The NATO chief said last week that the Western military alliance would soon send its written proposals to Russia, responding to Moscow's security demands and suggest serious talks on arms control and measures of transparency on military activities and missile deployments. Stoltenberg's comments came a day after NATO announced that some member countries were putting forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter jets to Eastern Europe. The moves signaled mounting fears of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, following months of military maneuvering by Moscow that has set off a tit-for-tat series of escalations with NATO. Speaking from Brussels, Stoltenberg said there is ""still a diplomatic way out"" of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, ""but that requires that Russia de-escalates and is ready to engage in good faith in political talks with NATO and NATO allies."" Russia has deployed tens of thousands of troops near its border with Ukraine since last year, and is sending forces into neighboring Belarus for joint exercises next month that Ukrainian officials fear could serve as a ""full-fledged theater of operations"" from which to launch an attack. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. ""NATO will not deploy NATO combat troops to Ukraine, but we need to be sure that there is no misunderstanding about our readiness, our commitment to defend all allies, especially in the eastern part of the alliance,"" Stoltenberg told CNN, explaining that was why the alliance had increased its presence in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Black Sea and Baltic regions. In a statement on Monday, NATO said that member states had announced a number of deployments to Eastern Europe in recent days. They include Denmark sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 fighter jets to Lithuania; the Netherlands deploying two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria; France expressing its readiness to send troops to Romania; and the US considering increasing its military presence in the East. There was no suggestion in the statement that the troops would be used to assist Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. Stoltenberg told CNN that NATO was weighing whether to further increase its position with ""enhanced forward presence or battlegroups, also in the southeast of the alliance."" ""Strong deterrence is the best way to prevent any attack on any NATO ally and the best way to prevent a conflict,"" he added. High-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped earlier this month without any breakthroughs, leaving prospects of de-escalation and future diplomacy in doubt. The US and its NATO allies had hoped the talks could spur Russia to pursue a path of ""de-escalation and diplomacy,"" but Russian officials were incensed over the US and NATO's refusal to entertain a contentious list of security demands. The demands include a ban on Ukraine entering NATO and that the alliance roll back its expansion in Eastern Europe. The US and its NATO allies have repeatedly said such proposals from Moscow are non-starters.",29,6.677191955282019,1.1999685936687836,5.477223361613236,4
2022-01-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-russia-republicans/index.html,Biden cranks up pressure as Putin mulls Ukraine invasion,"President Joe Biden and Western allies are signaling a stiffened stance in the showdown with Russia, piling on pressure designed to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine in a strategy that nevertheless risks quickening a dangerous cycle of escalation. The White House pivot comes with Biden now under searing pressure from Republicans to show more strength in the confrontation and follows a week in which he was heavily criticized for hastily walked-back comments that played into the Russian leader's hopes of dividing NATO. Several Republicans accused the President of showing weakness and appeasing Putin in talk show appearances on Sunday. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck a jarring tone by describing the Kremlin strongman as a ""very talented statesman"" who knew how to use power. GOP critiques of Biden ignored the party's tolerance of ex-President Donald Trump's craven deference to the Russian leader and some came across as an attempt to use a national security crisis to damage Biden politically ahead of midterm elections in 2022 and the 2024 presidential election. A series of moves, comments and signals from Washington and Europe over the weekend underscored the deepening peril of the situation at a time when there appears little meaningful diplomatic activity to stop its rapid deterioration. The State Department said Sunday it was authorizing the departure of non-essential staff and family members from its embassy in Kyiv and warned that in the event of a Russian invasion its capacity to help Americans in the country would be limited. In another significant development, administration officials said the President had discussed options that include deploying between 1,000 and 5,000 troops plus aircraft and ships to US allies in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe. NATO said early Monday that several member states, including France, Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands were either sending or considering small deployments of ships and aircraft to the Baltic and eastern European states. The mostly symbolic maneuvers appear calibrated to send a signal of resolve to Putin while avoiding the impression of a larger-scale mobilization that could send tensions spiraling out of control. ""We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defense,"" alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. On CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that if a single Russian unit entered Ukraine it ""would trigger a swift, a severe and a united response"" from the US and Europe. Britain, meanwhile, warned that it had intelligence that Putin was trying to install a puppet leader in place of the democratically elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And the head of Germany's navy was forced to resign after comments sympathetic to Russia in a drama that suggested an effort to cover-up deep divisions within the West about how to handle Putin. A potential US tactical shift Until now, the US has concentrated on sketching the dire consequences, in the form of debilitating sanctions, that it says would effectively cut Russia off from the Western economy in the event of an invasion. But the latest tactical decisions darkened an already foreboding atmosphere after Biden said last week that he believed that the decision on whether to invade Ukraine was Putin's dilemma alone. Talk of deploying troops also came across as a direct challenge to the Russian leader while at the same time being apparently designed to protect Biden's political flank at home. While the State Department said that it was acting out of an abundance of caution, drawing down embassy staffing is also a classic act of diplomatic symbolism that denotes a worsening crisis. Officials said any move to reinforce NATO flanks would be intended to ""provide deterrence and reassurance to allies."" It was not immediately clear whether deployments would come before or after any Russian invasion of Ukraine. But even talking about such steps puts Putin on notice that the entire premise of his hostage hold on Ukraine -- to force NATO to withdraw forces from ex-Soviet states -- would backfire. Yet the increasingly robust Western gambit is also a risk. It could convince Putin that he is right to warn that Russian security is threatened by the West. At the very least it could give him a propaganda pretext to invade Ukraine. And Biden must consider whether high-profile troop deployments before an invasion that the US says could come at any time could make it even harder for Putin to back down without securing a tangible payoff for his troop buildup. The latest US signals came after Russia amassed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders and initiated a new deployment of forces to Belarus, further surrounding its former Soviet client state, and after the government in Kyiv said that Moscow would soon have enough forces for a full-scale invasion. But Biden's latest steps will not satisfy Republicans who have demanded a much more aggressive US mobilization and are using the crisis to portray Biden as a feckless leader. Top Republican: 'Weakness invites aggression' Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Sunday urged the White House to use sanctions against Russia before any invasion as requested by the government of Ukraine. ""If we don't do something strong right now, I'm afraid that he's going to invade Ukraine, which will have global ramifications here,"" the Texas Republican said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" But Blinken rejected such an approach, warning that it would diminish the chances that concerns about consequences could influence Putin's decision. ""When it comes to sanctions, the purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression,"" Blinken said on ""State of the Union."" ""And so, if they're triggered now, you lose the deterrent effect."" McCaul also laid into Biden over the administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer, saying that it had convinced the Russian leader that the United States would not stand up for its interests. ""I think this all started ... with Afghanistan, and the unconditional surrender to the Taliban when he saw weakness. Weakness invited aggression,"" McCaul said on CBS. ""We're seen as weak right now ... because of President Biden."" (The administration argues the evacuation from Afghanistan was a huge success, but the initial debacle shocked US allies, left some to question the US' global commitment and helped hammer the President's approval ratings). The administration counters GOP criticism by saying that an agreement the Trump administration reached with the Taliban gave it no choice but to leave the country. Pompeo insisted on Fox that the previous administration had won Putin's respect by being strong, the result being that he ""didn't use coercive activity to try to push back on NATO."" It's true that some members of the Western alliance did increase military spending after Trump's complaints about the US being ripped off by its allies -- though perceptions of a rising Russian threat and his antipathy to the idea of defending allies also contributed. And the ex-President did allow lethal US aid to be sent to Ukraine, unlike former President Barack Obama. But his desire for Putin's approval often seemed to undermine his own administration's policy. His withdrawal from Syria, constant berating of NATO allies and denial of Russian election meddling advanced Putin's foreign policy goals. Pompeo: We should 'respect' Putin But Pompeo also offered gushing praise of the Russian leader's intellect that seemed tonally odd given that he's a US adversary currently threatening an armed takeover of a democracy supported by Washington. ""We had respect for him and his power. He's a very talented statesman,"" Pompeo said on Fox. ""He has lots of gifts. He was a KGB agent, for goodness' sakes. He knows how to use power, we should respect that."" The idea that the United States should respect a leader who rules with an iron fist, who crushed democracy and freedom of the press, imprisons political opponents and presides over a corrupt economy that empowers oligarchs is notable coming from an ex-secretary of state. Foreign policy experts often divide on the question of whether Putin is playing a tough hand with aplomb or whether his international gangsterism is more the act of a weak leader terrified of legitimate opposition and being forced from power. It's also questionable whether massing troops on the border of a vulnerable democracy and making outlandish demands of NATO is the behavior of a ""talented statesman."" And any arguments that Putin was cowed by Trump from using coercion against the West are confounded by US intelligence assessments that Moscow interfered in US elections. The then-President stunned the US espionage community by disowning assessments of Putin's 2016 meddling when he appeared side-by-side with him at a press conference in Helsinki. Cyberattacks emanating from Russian soil also took place throughout the Trump presidency, including the SolarWinds operation that breached US federal agencies when the former President was in power. Supposed respect for the US didn't stop Russian agents using a biological weapon on British soil to poison a defector, according to the UK government. The willingness of the GOP to criticize Biden, despite these huge blemishes on Trump's record, shows that for many of its members, with a few exceptions like McCaul, politics take priority over national security in the pursuit of future power. Such an approach only widens the divides on which Putin relies as he seeks to tarnish American prestige.",29,3.231864716423791,3.958664320451034,-0.7267996040272431,16
2022-01-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/politics/russia-cyberattack-warning-homeland-security/index.html,DHS warns of potential Russia cyberattacks amid tensions,"Russia would consider conducting a cyberattack on the US homeland if Moscow perceived that a US or NATO response to a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine ""threatened [Russia's] long-term national security,"" according to a Department of Homeland Security intelligence bulletin obtained by CNN. ""Russia maintains a range of offensive cyber tools that it could employ against US networks—from low-level denials-of-service to destructive attacks targeting critical infrastructure,"" says the January 23 memo, which DHS distributed to critical infrastructure operators and state and local governments. Despite US tensions with Russia over Ukraine, DHS analysts assess that Moscow's threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive cyberattacks on the US homeland ""probably remains very high,"" the memo says. ""[W]e have not observed Moscow directly employ these types of cyber attacks against US critical infrastructure—notwithstanding cyber espionage and potential prepositioning operations in the past."" Asked for comment, a DHS spokesperson said, ""The Department of Homeland Security regularly shares information with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial officials to ensure the safety and security of all communities across the country."" US officials have been bracing for potential retaliatory cyberattacks from the Kremlin as Russia has threatened to invade Ukraine by amassing some 100,000 troops along the Ukraine border. The Treasury Department held a classified briefing that covered the issue for big US banks, while the Energy Department has briefed America's largest electric utilities on Russian cyber capabilities, CNN previously reported. Ukraine 'a sort of testing ground' for cyberattacks Cyber operations have been a recurring aspect of the military conflict in Ukraine, analysts say, which began when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Suspected Russian hackers cut power in parts of Ukraine in 2015 and 2016, and unleashed devastating malware known as NotPetya in 2017 that began infecting organizations in Ukraine but spread globally, causing billions of dollars in damage. The US Justice Department blamed all three incidents on Russia's GRU military intelligence agency. ""I am concerned that Russia has been using Ukraine as a sort of testing ground for its cyber capabilities,"" Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN. ""For years, I've been making the case that we need rules of the road in cyberspace, just like we have defined norms around armed conflict,"" Warner said. ""We need to ensure that the Kremlin knows that if they were to use destructive cyberattacks against the United States, there would be serious consequences."" The Biden administration has repeatedly tried to impose costs in response to Russian hacking activity, including by sanctioning Russian technology firms. President Joe Biden said at a press conference last week that the US could respond with cyberoperations of its own should Russia conduct additional cyberattacks in Ukraine. Biden spoke days after a pair of cyberattacks targeted several Ukrainian government agencies that investigators believe were carried out by the same actor. In some cases, the hackers replaced content on government websites with threatening messages claiming Ukrainians' data had been stolen. In other cases, malicious software deleted data from roughly 20 computer servers and workstations at at least two Ukrainian government agencies, according to Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian official investigating the incident. The impact of the hacks has so far been limited, but Ukraine's recent history has officials on alert. ""One possibility ... is that this attack is just a front for a much stronger attack that we may face in the future,"" Serhiy Demedyuk, deputy secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told CNN. Ukraine preparing cyberdefenses As Ukraine readies its military to defend against a potential Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have held urgent cybersecurity meetings and drawn on US support to fortify their networks. Zhora told CNN that officials at the US Embassy in Kyiv were quick to offer help in recovering from the hacks. There is ""no doubt that [any Russian invasion] can be supported by cyber aggression — or at least they will stay active in cyberspace,"" said Zhora, who is a deputy chairman at Ukraine's State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection. It's unclear, for now, who was responsible for the recent website defacements and the small amount of data-wiping on Ukrainian government networks. Some of the tactics used are similar to those of Russian hackers, Zhora and Demedyuk said in separate interviews, but the evidence so far is inconclusive. Demedyuk has also suggested that a hacking group linked with Belarus intelligence could be involved, but he told CNN that theory is unproven as of now. ""The sheer amount of digital evidence involved in this attack has made it more difficult to pin down which group is responsible."" One immediate focus is on ensuring that the intruders have been kicked out of Ukrainian networks so they can't do more damage. ""We need to be sure [of that],"" Zhora said from his office in Kyiv.

2022-01-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/europe/russia-naval-exercise-ireland-intl/index.html,"Russian naval exercises off Ireland's coast 'not welcome,' says Foreign Minister","Planned Russian naval exercises within Ireland's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) are ""not welcome"" or ""wanted right now,"" Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister has said, as tensions between Russia and the West continue to simmer over fears that Moscow is planning an invasion of Ukraine. Russian naval exercises are due to take place in early February, approximately 240 kilometers (149 miles) off Ireland's southwest coast, Simon Coveney said in a statement late Sunday. The area is in Ireland's EEZ but not its territorial waters. Under international law, states are entitled to carry out naval exercises in another state's EEZ, Coveney said. He said the Irish Aviation Authority had been informed of the exercise via standard procedures. ""In light of the current political and security environment in Europe, the Department of Foreign Affairs has raised a number of concerns with the Russian authorities in respect of these exercises,"" Coveney added. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with a Russian troop buildup near the border spurring fears Moscow could soon launch an invasion. The Kremlin has denied it is planning to attack, arguing NATO support for Ukraine constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. NATO allies are putting forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter jets to eastern Europe, the organization said Monday. Meanwhile, the US State Department announced Sunday evening it would reduce staff levels at the US Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, beginning with the departure of nonessential staff and family members. On his way into the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on Monday, Coveney told reporters that he will brief his EU counterparts on Russia's plans to conduct the naval exercises. Although the area is part of Ireland's EEZ, it is in international waters, meaning Ireland doesn't ""have a power to prevent this happening,"" the Foreign Minister remarked. ""I've made it clear to the Russian ambassador in Ireland that it's not welcome. This isn't the time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what's happening with and in Ukraine at the moment,"" Coveney emphasized. ""The fact that they're choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, off the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that, in our view is simply not welcome and not wanted right now, particularly in the coming weeks,"" he said. EU foreign ministers want to send a clear message to Russia that if it decides to invade Ukraine it will be hit by the ""most comprehensive"" package of sanctions and restrictions ever prepared by the EU, Coveney said. US officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two. The UK foreign office said in a statement on Saturday that it has information the Russian government is planning to ""install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv as it considers whether to invade and occupy Ukraine.""",29,3.724412608186352,0.47901983521377595,3.245392772972576,4
2022-01-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/europe/nato-deployment-eastern-europe-ukraine-intl/index.html,NATO allies put forces on standby as tensions rise over Ukraine crisis,"NATO announced on Monday that some member countries are putting forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter jets to eastern Europe as the United Kingdom and the United States ordered diplomats' families to withdraw from Ukraine amid concerns of a Russian invasion. The developments underscore growing fears of a possible Russian incursion, following months of military maneuvering by Moscow that has set off a tit-for-tat series of escalations with NATO, a military alliance of Western powers. Russia has been building up forces and equipment near its border with Ukraine since last year, and is sending troops into neighboring Belarus for joint exercises next month that Ukrainian officials fear could serve as a ""full-fledged theater of operations"" from which to launch an attack. US intelligence officials have said they don't know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning to do so, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. After high-level talks between Moscow and Washington wrapped earlier this month without any breakthroughs over the tens of thousands of Russian troops amassed on Ukraine's border, prospects of de-escalation and future diplomacy have been cast into doubt. Now the Biden administration is weighing whether to deploy as many as 5,000 US troops, according to a senior defense official, to shore up NATO allies in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. On Monday, both NATO and Russia pointed the finger at each other for the ratcheting tensions. ""Tensions are escalating due to concrete actions taken by the US and NATO,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, referring to NATO's announcement. ""I mean the informational hysteria that we are witnessing -- it is generously framed by a huge amount of false information, just lies and fakes,"" Peskov added. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a Monday statement that the alliance would continue to take necessary measures ""to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance."" He added: ""We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence."" The NATO statement said that in recent days, a flurry of member states had announced deployments to the region. They include Denmark sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 fighter jets to Lithuania, the Netherlands deploying two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria, France expressing its readiness to send troops to Romania and the US considering increasing its military presence in the East. Stoltenberg cautioned in a news conference on Monday that the moves were defensive and proportionate -- and that NATO was ""not threatening Russia."" There was no suggestion in the statement that the troops would be used to assist Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. NATO, Europe and the US have been united in their opposition to any further Russian incursion in Ukraine, promising to lend support to Ukraine and hand down ""massive costs"" for Moscow in the event they make a move. But the shape of that response and what steps they might take are still unclear. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday warned that ""a single additional Russian force"" entering Ukraine ""in an aggressive way"" would result in a severe response by the US and its allies. His comments came after US President Joe Biden muddled the message of severe consequences last week, saying at a news conference that a ""minor incursion"" might not trigger the same response from NATO as an invasion. The President later clarified that any Russian troops crossing Ukraine's border would constitute an invasion. CNN reported last week that the US military goal would be to ""meet the capability"" NATO allies in the region are asking for, a defense official said. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that as many as 8,500 US troops have been put on heightened preparedness to deploy. The mobilization of Western forces comes amid a significant uptick in Russia's military movements, not only on Ukraine's border -- where the Ukrainian Defense Ministry says there are now 127,000 Russian troops stationed -- but elsewhere in Europe. The Russian Defense Ministry announced last week that 140 ships and 10,000 servicemen would take part in sweeping exercises from the Pacific to the Atlantic, including off Ireland's southwest coast in February. The ministry said the main purpose of the drills is to protect Russia's national interests in the world's oceans, TASS state news agency reported. Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told reporters on Monday that he had raised concerns with Moscow about Russia's plans. ""This isn't the time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what's happening with and in Ukraine at the moment,"" Coveney said. Coveney and other European Union foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss the security situation in Ukraine and what action to take should Russia cross into Ukrainian territory; Blinken joined by video link following talks with Lavrov in Geneva. EU foreign ministers want to send a clear message to Russia that if it decides to invade Ukraine it will be hit by the ""most comprehensive"" package of sanctions and restrictions ever prepared by the EU, Coveney said. But while NATO countries ramp up readiness and the EU discusses heightened security concerns, Ukraine's own government has not, at least outwardly, signaled the same sense of urgency. In a call with the President of the European Council Charles Michel on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country will not succumb to provocations, but would ""keep calm."" Zelensky and his government have previously downplayed the danger of a Russian invasion, noting that the threat has existed for years and has not become greater in recent months. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia has been rumbling since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a rebellion in Ukraine's east. Despite a cease fire in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace. Ukraine on Monday criticized the US' decision to withdraw diplomats' families and reduce staff levels at the US Embassy in Kyiv, with Oleg Nikolenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, saying in a tweet: ""We believe such a step to be a premature one & an instance of excessive caution."" But other countries are also taking precautions in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. The UK Foreign Office also announced Monday that some British Embassy staff and dependents were being withdrawn from Kyiv in response to ""growing threats from Russia."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that the intelligence around the situation in Ukraine was ""gloomy"" but that war was not inevitable. Speaking to reporters at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday, the bloc's chief diplomat Josep Borrell said Europe will seek to simmer tensions between Russia and Ukraine through diplomacy first but warned Moscow it is prepared to take action if necessary. He also urged for calm, stressing the need to avoid ""alarmist reactions that could that could lead to an escalation. We don't want people to have a breakdown on this."" Borrell added that the EU had no current plans to evacuate diplomatic staff and their families from Ukraine.",29,0.38776982033398155,2.066046453820649,-1.6782766334866674,4
2022-01-23,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/23/europe/german-navy-chief-resignation-intl/index.html,German navy chief resigns after suggesting Putin 'deserved respect',"The chief of German navy has resigned after suggesting that Crimea would ""never come back"" to Ukraine, a statement that is in direct contradiction to the stance taken by the German government, the European Union and NATO. Vice-Admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach said he asked the German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht to relieve him of his duties ""effective immediately."" His resignation on Saturday came at the time of extreme tension between Russia and the West over recent buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border. Schönbach got into hot water over several remarks that included a suggestion that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""probably"" deserved respect. A video of his talk at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, a think tank, was posted on YouTube on Friday. In it, the Vice-Admiral is heard as saying: ""Is Russia really interested in ... a small, tiny strip of Ukraine's soil? No, this is nonsense."" ""What he really wants is respect. And my God, giving someone respect is low cost, even no cost ... so if I was asked, it is easy to even give him the respect he really demands, and probably also deserves,"" he said, adding: ""Russia is an old country. Russia is an important country. Even we, India, Germany, we need Russia, because we need Russia against China."" The remarks sparked criticism in Germany and abroad. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs has summoned the German ambassador to Ukraine over the comments, saying it ""strongly rejected"" Schönbach's statements on Crimea never returning to Ukraine. Schönbach said that the comments he made during the talk reflected his personal opinion ""at that moment"" and that ""they correspond in no way with the official position of the ministry of defense."" However, he said the remarks were ""increasingly weighing on my office"" and therefore he decided to resign. Schönbach took over as the chief of navy, officially known as the Inspector of the Navy, in March last year, after more than 35 years in the navy. He served as the commanding officer of NATO Maritime Group 2, NATO's standing maritime immediate reaction force. Meanwhile, as Russia amasses troops on the Ukrainian border, the Ukraine government has been asking NATO countries for help. While the US, UK and several other NATO countries shipped weapons to Ukraine, Germany has so far refused to do so. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told journalists earlier this week that Germany often restricted the export of weapons to crisis areas. ""Germany has a special tradition of showed great restraint when it comes to exporting weapons and arms to crisis areas,"" she said. ""We have tried to assume responsibility in different ways. We, for example, have helped expand the military hospital.""",29,2.96367600923152,3.6772001856435463,-0.7135241764120264,20

""The former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev is being considered as a potential candidate,"" the British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said. Murayev told CNN Saturday ""there is nothing to comment on"" regarding the allegations, as he is a Ukrainian national and still facing Russian sanctions. The statement went on to name four other former Ukrainian officials, saying, ""We have information that the Russian intelligence services maintain links with numerous former Ukrainian politicians"" including Serhiy Arbuzov, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine from 2012 to 2014, and acting Prime Minister in 2014; Andriy Kluyev, First Deputy Prime Minister from 2010 to 2012 and Chief of Staff to former Ukrainian President Yanukovich, Vladimir Sivkovich, former Deputy Head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council (RNBO); Mykola Azarov, Prime Minister of Ukraine from 2010-2014, it said. ""Some of these have contact with Russian intelligence officers currently involved in the planning for an attack on Ukraine,"" the British foreign office statement added. Russia has denied allegations it is planning to attack Ukraine. CNN has reached out to Azarov for comment but has not received a response. CNN has been unable to reach Kluyev and Arbuzov, and local media reports suggest the two former Ukrainian politicians are avoiding media attention. According to Ukrainian state media, Arbuzov is living in Russia. Meanwhile, Kluyev's whereabouts are unknown and he has been declared wanted in Ukraine, according to state media. CNN has also been unable to reach Sivkovich. Early Sunday, Russia's foreign ministry urged the UK's foreign office to ""stop engaging in provocations,"" state news agency TASS reported. ""The misinformation spread by the British Foreign Office is another evidence that these are the NATO countries, led by the Anglo-Saxons, that are escalating tensions around Ukraine. We call on the British Foreign Office to stop provocative activities, stop spreading nonsense and focus on studying the history of the Tatar-Mongol yoke,"" a representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry told TASS. CNN reached out to the UK foreign office on Saturday for further comment on its claims, as well as supporting evidence, but it said it would not comment any further. ""The information being released today shines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin thinking,"" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement. ""Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy,"" Truss said. ""As the UK and our partners have said repeatedly, any Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs."" On Twitter, Truss said: ""We will not tolerate (a) Kremlin plot to install pro-Russian leadership in Ukraine."" British deputy prime minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday that Russia will face severe economic sanctions if it installs its own regime in Ukraine. ""We are standing shoulder to shoulder, saying there will be very serious consequences in Russia takes this move to try and invade, but also install a puppet regime,"" Raab told Sky News on Sunday. CNN also reached out to the US State Department and the White House for comment. Source: US has 'same information' as UK In a statement Saturday, the White House said President Joe Biden met with his national security team to discuss ""continued Russian aggressive actions toward Ukraine."" The President was briefed on the state of Russian military operations on Ukraine's borders and ""discussed both our ongoing efforts to de-escalate the situation with diplomacy and our range of deterrence measures that are being coordinated closely with our Allies and partners, including ongoing deliveries of security assistance to Ukraine,"" it added. ""President Biden again affirmed that should Russia further invade Ukraine, the United States will impose swift and severe consequences on Russia with our Allies and partners,"" the White House said. A source briefed on the US and British intelligence confirmed the US has similar evidence as the UK, regarding Russia's plot to install a friendly government in Ukraine. ""Yes, we have seen the intelligence that Russia is looking at ways to minimize a long, drawn out war. That includes things like installing a friendly government and using its spy agencies to foment dissent,"" the source said. Another source briefed said the US ""has the same information."" Russia has previously been accused of attempting to sow chaos in Ukraine through cyberattacks and, purportedly, plotting to take control of the government in Kyiv. But the Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning to invade. CNN previously reported the US accused Russia of recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to attempt to take control of Ukraine's government as it unveiled new sanctions on Thursday. The Treasury Department rolled out sanctions against four current and former Ukrainian officials it said were involved in Kremlin-directed influence activities to destabilize Ukraine. Those newly sanctioned individuals include Taras Romanovych Kozak, Volodymyr Mykolayovych Oliynyk, Vladimir Leonidovich Sivkovich, and Oleh Voloshyn. Sivkovich was the only former Ukrainian politician named in both the US and UK announcements. The Treasury said the four individuals -- two of whom are current members of Ukraine's Parliament --- were acting under the direction of a Russian intelligence service sanctioned by the US and played ""various roles"" in Russia's ""global influence campaign to destabilize sovereign countries in support of the Kremlin's political objectives."" US National Security Council Spokesperson Emily Horne expressed solidarity with Ukraine as the UK Foreign Office said it had information the Russian government is planning to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine, calling the plot ""deeply concerning."" ""This kind of plotting is deeply concerning,"" Horne said. ""The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine."" Romania, Bulgaria slam Russia's demands to move NATO troops That comes as NATO members Romania and Bulgaria slammed Russia's demand to remove alliance troops from both countries as ""unacceptable,"" with each arguing that the Kremlin has no right to interfere in the foreign policy decisions of other sovereign states. The comments from both countries came just hours after Russia's Foreign Ministry confirmed its demand for NATO to pull back troops from parts of eastern Europe included Bulgaria and Romania. The two countries are located on the Black Sea, which analysts believe Moscow sees as an important geostrategic buffer zone between itself and Europe. Romania's Ministry of Foreign affairs said in a statement Saturday ""such a demand is unacceptable and cannot be negotiated."" Bulgaria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged Moscow to ""to show respect to the foreign policy choice consciously made by Bulgaria."" Bulgaria's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Marin Raykov, told the BBC the Kremlin's demand is ""an expression of contempt for the sovereign rights of Bulgaria to choose the sources of guarantees for national security."" Russia and NATO have been at loggerheads since late last year, when the Kremlin deployed an estimated 100,000 troops to its border with Ukraine. That military posturing has prompted fears that Russia is planning another incursion into Ukraine after invading and illegally annexing the Crimean peninsula in 2014. That same year, Moscow began supporting a pro-Russian separatist movement in eastern Ukraine that's left thousands dead. In its statement, Romania said the NATO military presence in eastern Europe is ""a strictly defensive reaction to the increasingly aggressive behavior of the Russian Federation ... which started in 2014. when the Ukrainian territory Crimea was illegally occupied by Russia."" ""This behavior continues to intensify in the present, despite NATO's attempts to engage in constructive dialogue,"" the statement read. The United States and its NATO allies have repeatedly warned Russia any movement of its troops into Ukranian territory would be met with what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called ""a severe and a united response."" Russian President Vladimir Putin has argued in recent weeks that his country is the aggrieved party, and is responding to NATO's cooperation with Ukraine and the alliance's eastward expansion since the fall of the Soviet Union -- which Russia views as an existential security threat. Diplomats from all sides have been attempting to negotiate a peaceful settlement, though one of Russia's core demands -- that NATO withdraw foreign military forces and equipment from members of the alliance who joined after 1997 -- was quickly deemed a non-starter by Western diplomats. ""NATO allies are ready to engage in dialogue with Russia, but we will not compromise on core principles,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier this month. ""We will not compromise on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every nation in Europe, and we will not compromise on the right for all countries to do, to choose their own path, including what kind of security arrangements they want to be part of, and will not compromise on the right for allies to protect and defend each other."" Weaponry sent to Ukraine NATO members have, in recent days, deployed military equipment and personnel to eastern alliance members in response to Russia's troop buildup in Ukraine. The Dutch Defense Minister said the Netherlands would deploy two F-35 jets, along with support staff, to Bulgaria in April or May, while the Spanish Defense Minister offered to send fighter jets and a warship to the Black Sea. The alliance has also begun sending weaponry to Kyiv to deter a potential Russian invasion and strengthen Ukraine's defensive capabilities. Light anti-tank weapons from the United Kingdom have already arrived in the country, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Tuesday, while the Czech Republic plans donate 152-milimeter caliber artillery ammunition to Ukraine in the coming days, Czech Defense Minister Jana Černochová said Friday. Germany will supply a fully equipped field hospital to Ukraine, according to the German Defense Ministry. The country has traditionally avoided exporting arms to crisis areas since World War II, but German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said earlier this week that ""all measures"" will be on the table if there is further Russian aggression against Ukraine. The US Embassy in Kyiv said Friday",29,1.9933485680179948,2.756372557193477,-0.7630239891754822,7
2022-01-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/22/politics/russia-ukraine-us-what-matters/index.html,Why Russia's Ukraine aggression matters to Americans,"Nobody knows for sure exactly what Vladimir Putin is doing with around 100,000 Russian troops parked near the Russia-Ukraine border, but it's making the US and Europe extremely nervous. President Joe Biden said this week he expected the Russians would ""move in"" and that a slight incursion would be met differently than a full-on invasion. The US has spent the past few days cleaning up that remark and making clear any type of invasion is unacceptable. Asked in Geneva by a reporter if he thought, like Biden, that an invasion was likely, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov used some interesting language. ""Unless the United States doesn't go to bed with Ukraine, I don't think so,"" Lavrov said. What does it mean for countries to 'go to bed'? All of this high-stakes geopolitical chess, then, comes down to how intimate the US gets with Ukraine in the eyes of Russia. After meeting with Lavrov in Geneva, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated there would be steep consequences for an invasion, but also that the two countries are still talking. The US will provide a written response to Russia's concerns within the next week. Putin's desire to somehow reconstitute the power of the Soviet Union is no secret. Spreading Russian power further into Ukraine would be a logical step and a direct challenge to Western democracies. Putin will require something. Former US Secretary of Defense William Cohen told CNN's Kate Bolduan Friday that Putin is not a ""Hamlet-like character"" trying to decide what to do. Everything is calculated and intentional. ""He's going to get something out of this that satisfies him, that he's made his point that Ukraine can never become truly independent, cannot become a member of NATO and cannot have any kind of offensive arms,"" Cohen said. Those are demands, he said, the US cannot meet. The backstory. Some points of context from this excellent report from inside Ukraine by CNN's Matthew Chance and Laura Smith-Spark: Russia already annexed a portion of Ukraine, Crimea, in 2014. Russian-backed separatists took over the Donbas portion of the country that same year, and clashes and sniper attacks continue there. Putin feels threatened by NATO and feels that NATO support for Ukraine is a ""red line."" Ukraine fears a preplanned coup to topple its government could be part of an invasion plan. One way to mollify Putin may be for Biden and European leaders to promise not to bring Ukraine into the NATO fold. Ukraine, which is not part of NATO, would like to keep its options open. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN, in response to Russian calls for NATO to halt its eastward expansion. NATO has grown since the fall of the Soviet Union, adding numerous countries that were formerly part of the Soviet bloc. These include the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; and North Macedonia 2020. 'Assume the worst.' When CNN's John King played Lavrov's comment about the US going to bed with Ukraine for another former Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, he said the first thing is to be skeptical of the Russian leaders. ""I begin on the premise that you don't trust what Lavrov or Putin say,"" Panetta said. ""I don't think we can assume that just because Lavrov says that Russia is not going to invade that that's the case, so I just think we have to assume the worst at this point."" Remember, they're adversaries. Panetta went on to argue that Americans should view the Russian leaders as trying to undermine the US and NATO. ""These are adversaries,"" Panetta said. ""Their whole intent is to basically weaken the United States, weaken the alliance and undermine our democracy, and I think it's very important for the US and our allies to be very strong about the kind of response that will take place if they invade."" Emphasis on deterrence. There is no indication at all the US would send combat troops to Ukraine. It is, after all, not a party to NATO. There are small numbers of National Guard and Special Operations troops in Ukraine as trainers. And the US gave Ukraine roughly $450 million worth of military aid in 2021 and is weighing how to help prop up the Ukrainian military. Panetta said it's not a foregone conclusion that Russia invades Ukraine, and there is an opportunity to deter Putin, particularly with military signaling. The Biden administration has authorized Baltic states to send US-manufactured military hardware to Ukraine. While Russia is currently under economic sanctions, more biting efforts to cut Russia off from the Western economy could also be used as deterrents. These could include restricting Russia's access to the US dollar and squashing its effort with Germany to build a national gas pipeline around Ukraine and directly into Europe. The US and Europe are not on the same page when it comes to deterring Russia, something Biden made clear during his news conference this week. Invasion will hurt the US and Europe. Everyday Americans would feel the effects of an invasion in their bank accounts. Gas prices could soar, writes CNN's Matt Egan. ""It's impossible to say how high prices would go — and how long they would stay high. But $100 oil would surely lift prices at the pump. And that means a Russia-Ukraine conflict has the potential to impact most Americans."" The status of Western democracies. There is something more than the economy, however. Biden has built his presidency around the idea that democratic countries must stand up to autocratic regimes. As CNN's Stephen Collinson smartly writes, Putin ""is using Ukraine as a hostage to try to force the US to renegotiate the settled outcome of the Cold War."" Collinson also explains why Americans more concerned about the economy and the coronavirus pandemic should care about this ""most tense test of wills since the fall of the Soviet Union."" Nothing less than ""the biggest clash of regular conventional armies in Europe since World War II"" is at stake.",29,1.8748930408507591,2.295986691396745,-0.4210936505459857,4
2022-01-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/politics/blinken-lavrov-geneva-meeting-ukraine/index.html,Blinken warns any Russian 'invasion' of Ukraine would be met with a 'severe and a united response' following Lavrov meeting,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that any Russian invasion of Ukraine would be ""met with a severe and a united response"" following his meeting Friday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the latest round of diplomatic talks that Blinken said provided a ""clearer path of understanding each others' concerns."" Blinken's meeting with Lavrov came two days after President Joe Biden muddled the US message of severe consequences for Russia, saying at a press conference that a ""minor incursion"" might not trigger the same response from NATO as an invasion. Biden clarified Thursday that any Russian troops crossing Ukraine's border would constitute an invasion. Blinken held a 90-minute bilateral meeting Friday in Geneva with Lavrov, in which the US sought to convince Russia to de-escalate the situation at the Ukrainian border where Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops. Blinken said that the meeting was ""not a negotiation,"" just like last week's talks between NATO and the West. ""We didn't expect any major breakthroughs to happen today, but I believe we are on a clearer path in terms of understanding each other's concerns, each others' positions,"" Blinken said at a press conference after the meeting. ""Let's see what the next days bring."" The Americans and Russians agreed to keep talking -- but on little else -- following the latest round of diplomatic talks. Blinken said that the US would provide Russia with a written response next week to the concerns that it had publicly released, something that Moscow has sought. ""I told him that following the consultations that we'll have in the coming days with allies and partners, we anticipate that we will be able to share with Russia our concerns and ideas in more detail and in writing next week, and we agreed to further discussions after that,"" Blinken told reporters following his sitdown with Lavrov. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the US planned to put in writing ""the serious concerns that we and other allies and partners have about Russia's actions, as well as ideas for how we might actually strengthen each other's sense of security going forward."" ""This is just a part of the diplomatic process and diplomatic negotiations,"" she said of the written responses. Ukraine fears eased but warn of delaying tactics A senior Ukrainian official warned that continuing US-Russian diplomacy could simply be a delaying tactic by Moscow to further prepare for a military offensive. The official told CNN's Matthew Chance that the US and Ukrainian leadership were closely coordinating on the diplomatic efforts, and that Ukrainian officials had been given a ""full debrief"" by Blinken following his meeting with Lavrov on Friday. The official said the US had stressed that there would be ""no concessions given to Russia on Ukraine,"" and that Ukraine would not be ""coerced to make any concessions"". Private and public assurances from the US that any Russian incursion -- even a minor one -- would trigger a harsh response has ""eased Ukrainian fears, to some extent,"" the official said. Blinken said that he once again reiterated Moscow's central demand -- that the US and NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine as a member -- is simply a non-starter. Moscow, however, reiterated Friday its insistence that NATO not only agree never to admit Ukraine but also the withdrawal of troops and forces back to NATO's 1997 borders, before several countries in Eastern Europe were admitted. The Russian foreign ministry specifically singled out Bulgaria and Romania, the latter of which shares Ukraine's southern border. ""We are talking about the withdrawal of foreign forces, hardware, and weapons as well as other steps that will ensure that the setup in the countries that were not NATO members back in 1997 would be reverted to what it was back then,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. ""These include Bulgaria and Romania."" US looking at boosting allies military options The Defense Department is working on a series of military options for Biden's approval that could be activated to beef up US military presence in eastern Europe as a deterrence if Russia invades Ukraine, according to two defense officials. ""We are exploring a wide range of options on how we would bolster our allies militarily,"" the first official said. These options would also likely be supported by sanctions. The goal of any military reinforcement in eastern Europe would be to provide deterrence and reassurance to allies. The options could include ""movement of assets and forces already in Europe and also assets and forces available outside of Europe,"" the official said. A Russian invasion ""certainly would be one trigger"" for US troops and assets to move. But some forces might be used in exercises and other training scenarios as well. Broadly, the US military goal would be to ""meet the capability"" NATO allies in the region are asking for, the official said. US forces could operate, as they already do, unilaterally in Europe, but could also operate under existing NATO command structures. Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border, and US officials have warned an attack could happen at any time. Biden said Wednesday he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin would invade Ukraine. The US has warned that it will impose severe consequences in the event of an invasion -- and Blinken reiterated Friday that meant Russian troops crossing the border. ""We've been clear. If any Russian military forces move across Ukraine's border, that's a renewed invasion. It will be met with swift, severe and a united response from the United States and our partners and allies,"" Blinken said. Lavrov, however, insisted Friday that Russia was not planning to attack. ""You claim that we are going to attack Ukraine, although we have repeatedly explained that this is not the case,"" Lavrov said when asked about a potential invasion by CNN Senior International Correspondent Frederik Pleitgen. Blinken said that the US was acting on the basis of ""facts and history,"" noting the Russian troops that have swelled on the border as well as Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea. He said that a ""charitable interpretation"" of their disagreements is that the US and Russia sometimes have ""different interpretations of history."" ""Today, we certainly heard things we strongly disagree with in terms of that history,"" Blinken said. Blinken's meeting with Lavrov on Friday followed his meetings in Berlin with his German, UK and French counterparts and Kyiv, where he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Biden's comments on Wednesday acknowledging disunity within NATO over how to respond to a ""minor incursion"" by Russia prompted outcry from stunned Ukrainian officials who warned the remarks were a green-light to Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted Thursday ""there are no minor incursions,"" in what amounted to an implicit rebuke of Biden.",29,1.0957983439881192,0.9128552654030305,0.18294307858508863,4
2022-01-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/europe/biden-ukraine-comments-upset-europe-intl-cmd/index.html,Biden reveals an uncomfortable truth about NATO's divide on Russian aggression in Ukraine,"US President Joe Biden's admission that Western allies are not entirely united on how they would respond to a ""minor"" Russian incursion into Ukraine has sparked an uproar in Kiev. They were also met with concern in Europe, where officials and observers said Biden's candid remarks had turned a spotlight on an uncomfortable truth at a dangerous moment. Foreign diplomats and experts said Biden's comments were also an acknowledgment of a harsh reality: as tensions rise on the Ukrainian border, NATO allies are not all on the same page. During a rare news conference on Wednesday to mark the anniversary of his inauguration, Biden said: ""It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do. But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine."" When asked to clarify what a ""minor incursion"" was, the President said he drew the line at ""Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighters,"" before adding that ""there are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens."" The White House later clarified that Biden would consider any movement of Russian troops over the border as an invasion and would act accordingly -- and that lesser acts of Russian aggression, like a cyberattack, would be met with a reciprocal response. There is ""some truth there, which didn't need to be said out loud,"" one NATO diplomat told CNN Thursday. ""It's not like the Russians didn't know that, say, a cyber-attack against Ukraine wouldn't trigger a full-scale response."" This sentiment was echoed by a senior EU diplomat who said, ""I think he was actually quite truthful in what he said. Whether it was politically OK, I don't know."" The fear is that Biden saying this publicly will give Russian President Vladimir Putin the green light to escalate what is already a very dangerous situation. Biden said in the same answer that he predicts Russia will ""move in"" to Ukraine, which warned earlier this week that the build-up of Russian troops near the border between the two nations was ""almost completed."" The NATO diplomat who spoke to CNN said that there is a ""lack of clarity"" over what the specific response would be from NATO allies to specific Russian actions. ""There aren't yet staked out positions,"" the diplomat explained, but said it would probably ""break out on the lines you would expect -- US, UK, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Easterners would have a low-trigger threshold, everyone else a higher one."" Europe's disunity, while less dramatic than Moscow might like, was visible earlier in the week, when French President Emmanuel Macron said the European Parliament should seek to agree a new security deal with Russia and enter its own dialogue with the Kremlin. Macron has long supported the EU taking greater control of its defense and security capabilities and has led calls for a standing European army. However, even EU member states are divided on how far that should go. And countries that previously lived under the rule of the Soviet Union are deeply skeptical of doing anything that might undermine NATO, the US-led military alliance that underpins European security. Most European countries are members of NATO. Riho Terras, a former commander of the Estonia's military, said, ""Macron has an infamous quality to think out of the box and throw ideas that have little to do with the real world,"" and that his ""proposal to launch the EU dialogue with Russia falls to the same category."" Alexander Stubb, former prime minister of Finland -- another country that shares a border with Russia -- says that while ""strengthening European defense would certainly help, it would not be in Finland's interest to duplicate what NATO is already doing."" Finland is not currently a NATO member. What impact will Biden's words actually have on the situation in Ukraine? Experts were divided given the unpredictability of the situation. Terras said Russia invading Ukraine ""a bit more"" was not something the West should tolerate and that Biden's comments could ""simply encourage Putin to seize the opportunity and launch a 'minor incursion' but by his (own) definition."" Velina Tchakarova, director of the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy, believes that Biden's comments will have ""a devastating psychological effect on the European NATO allies as well as the Ukrainian establishment,"" but that they would likely not factor in Putin's thinking much because ""Moscow is used to the diplomatic language of Western officials and does not take it at face value."" Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House and author of the forthcoming book ""How Russia Gets Its Way,"" says: ""the effect of his comments in Russia may well be just as much confusion they have caused elsewhere, as Russia's government apparatus struggles to unscramble the mixed messages from Washington."" On the whole, most EU officials that spoke to CNN don't think that Biden's comments will prompt a major escalation from the Kremlin. What they are deeply upset by, however, is the finger being pointed at Europe's disunity on security quite so directly.",29,1.6773453674428727,2.45156195739907,-0.7742165899561975,20
2022-01-20,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/europe/ukraine-russia-tensions-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html,Tensions are high on Ukraine's border with Russia. Here's what you need to know,"Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with a Russian troop build-up near the two nations' borders spurring fears that Moscow could launch an invasion. Ukraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. The picture is complicated -- but here's a breakdown of what we know. What's the situation on the border? The United States and NATO have described the movements and concentrations of troops in and around Ukraine as ""unusual."" As many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine ""as soon as early 2022."" Speaking alongside his Ukrainian counterpart in Kyiv on January 19, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had ""ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine's border, which it could double on relatively short order."" In late 2021, satellite photos revealed Russian hardware -- including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles -- on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300 km) from the border. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest intelligence assessment says Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops near Ukraine, including some 21,000 air and sea personnel, transferred more Iskander operational-tactical missiles to the border, and increased its intelligence activity against the country. The assessment came after three rounds of diplomatic talks between Russia and the West aimed at de-escalating the crisis failed to produce a resolution. US officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two. Many of Russia's military bases are to the west of the vast country -- the direction from which history suggests any threats are most likely to come. Russia's Defense Ministry has said it is conducting ""regular"" winter military drills in its southern region, parts of which border Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia, an area known as Donbas, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian forces are also present in the area, referred to by Ukraine as ""temporarily occupied territories,"" although Russia denies it. The front lines of the conflict have barely moved in five years, but there are frequent small-scale clashes and sniper attacks. Russia was angered when Ukrainian forces deployed a Turkish-made combat drone for the first time in October to strike a position held by the pro-Russian separatists. Russia also has forces numbering in the tens of thousands at its massive naval base in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014. The Crimean peninsula, which lies to the south of the rest of Ukraine, is now connected by a road bridge to mainland Russia. What's the history of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia? Tensions between Ukraine and Russia, both former Soviet states, escalated in late 2013 over a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. After the pro-Russian then-President, Viktor Yanukovych, suspended the talks -- reportedly under pressure from Moscow -- weeks of protests in Kyiv erupted into violence. Then, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, an autonomous peninsula in southern Ukraine with strong Russian loyalties, on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian-speaking citizens. First, thousands of Russian-speaking troops, dubbed ""little green men"" and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the Crimean peninsula. Within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate. Shortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence from Kyiv, prompting months of heavy fighting. Despite Kyiv and Moscow signing a peace deal in Minsk in 2015, brokered by France and Germany, there have been repeated ceasefire violations. According to UN figures, there have been more than 3,000 conflict-related civilian deaths in eastern Ukraine since March 2014. The European Union and US have imposed a series of measures in response to Russia's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including economic sanctions targeting individuals, entities and specific sectors of the Russian economy. The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of stirring up tensions in the country's east and of violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement. What's Russia's view? The Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans on invading Ukraine, insisting Russia does not pose a threat to anyone and that the country moving troops across its own territory should not be cause for alarm. Moscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO -- in terms of weaponry, training and personnel -- as a threat to its own security. It has also accused Ukraine of boosting its own troop numbers in preparation for an attempt to retake the Donbas region, an allegation Ukraine has denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia's borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances. Putin has also said that NATO deploying sophisticated weapons in Ukraine, such as missile systems, would be crossing a ""red line"" for Russia, amid concern in Moscow that Ukraine is being increasingly armed by NATO powers. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in November that weapons and military advisers were already being supplied to Ukraine by the US and other NATO member states. ""And all this, of course, leads to a further aggravation of the situation on the border line,"" he said. If the US and its NATO allies do not change course in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that Moscow has the ""right to choose ways to ensure its legitimate security interests."" What is Ukraine's view? Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO if it chooses. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN, in response to Russian calls for NATO to halt its eastward expansion. ""Any Russian proposals to discuss with NATO or the US any so-called guarantees that the Alliance would not expand to the East are illegitimate,"" it added. Ukraine insists Russia is seeking to destabilize the country with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, recently saying a coup plot, involving Ukrainians and Russians, had been uncovered. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that a planned coup could be part of Russia's plan ahead of a military invasion. ""External military pressure goes hand in hand with domestic destabilization of the country,"" he said. Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. At the same time, Zelensky's government faces challenges on many fronts. The government's popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy. Many people are also unhappy that the government hasn't yet delivered on benefits it promised and ended the conflict in the country's east. Anti-government protests have taken place in Kyiv. In a January 19 video address, Zelensky urged the Ukrainian people to ""calm down"" amid mounting unease over a possible Russian invasion. ""We are aware of everything, we are ready for everything,"" he said, before adding that he ""sincerely believes"" this year ""will pass without a war"" with Russia. Kuleba also sought to reassure Ukrainians who fear the US, its NATO allies and Russia could leave Kyiv out of discussions. ""No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine is a principle that we adhere to,"" he said. What does NATO say? NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said ""there will be a high price to pay for Russia"" if it once again invades Ukraine, a NATO partner. ""We have a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions,"" said Stoltenberg, in a December 1 interview with CNN. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO increased its defenses ""with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia ... but also in the Black Sea region,"" Stoltenberg said. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and therefore doesn't have the same security guarantees as NATO members. But Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that it cannot pursue NATO membership. High-stakes talks between Russia and NATO in Brussels in mid-January were ""not an easy discussion,"" according to Stoltenberg, who added that ""differences will not be easy to bridge."" However, NATO allies and Russia ""expressed the need to resume dialogue,"" he said. What does the United States say? President Joe Biden told Zelensky earlier this month in a phone call that the US and its allies ""will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine."" But Biden appeared to undermine that message when he subsequently suggested during a White House news conference that a ""minor incursion"" by Russia would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion of the country. While Biden vowed harsh economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the border, including restricting its financial transitions in US dollars, he suggested Western nations were not in sync on what to do should a lesser violation occur. ""There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens,"" he said. His remarks prompted a swift White House clarification. ""President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,"" press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement. One Ukrainian official told CNN he was ""shocked that the US President Biden would distinguish between incursion and invasion"" and suggest that a minor incursion would not trigger sanctions",29,1.5209656037855217,1.1798582645132691,0.34110733927225256,4

Blinken's meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Kyiv Wednesday were the first of three stops the top US diplomat is making this week amid warnings from the US that Russia, which has amassed tens of thousands of troops near near Ukrainian borders, could launch an invasion at any point. ""As we meet today, Russia has ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine's border, which it could double on relatively short order,"" Blinken said during a press conference alongside Kuleba. Blinken will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday, one week after US, NATO and European officials held multiple diplomatic meetings with Russian officials that ended without any significant breakthroughs. Blinken said he would not be presenting a formal response to Russia's specific demands that NATO agree to never admit Ukraine -- which the US has said is a non-starter -- adding that it was ""not clear what Russia's central demand is or not"" and the effort now is to get at the heart of what those demands really are. ""I won't be presenting a paper at that time to Foreign Minister Lavrov,"" Blinken said. ""We need to see where we are and see if there remain opportunities to pursue the diplomacy and pursue the dialogue, which again, as I said, is by far the preferable course."" At a news conference Wednesday marking the first year of his presidency, President Joe Biden predicted a Russian invasion of Ukraine, citing existential concerns by Russian President Vladimir Putin, even as he warned of significant economic consequences when such an incursion occurs. But Biden suggested that a ""minor incursion"" would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion. ""I'm not so sure he is certain what he is going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something,"" Biden said, describing a leader searching for relevance in a post-Soviet world: ""He is trying to find his place in the world between China and the West."" Zelensky, meanwhile, said Wednesday in a video address to the nation that he ""sincerely believes"" this year ""will pass without a war"" with Russia. ""Everything is under control and everything is going according to plan,"" Zelensky said. ""Do not worry constantly what will happen in the future."" Standing alongside Blinken in Kyiv on Wednesday, Kuleba thanked the US for its support of Ukraine, while accusing Russia of trying to sow panic and stoke fear in Ukrainian institutions from the inside. ""We therefore need to apply all our efforts to prevent Russia from achieving that goal,"" he said. ""Even before we reach to our arms, our efforts are focused on making sure that the situation in Ukraine stays stable and our financial system is strong and protected."" During his meeting with Zelensky on Wednesday, Blinken reiterated that Russia has two paths out of the current situation. ""There is the path of diplomacy and dialogue to try to resolve whatever differences there are peacefully through diplomacy,"" he said in his remarks to staff at the embassy. ""Clearly the preferable path, clearly the most responsible path and the one that we would prefer, but there is also the path if Russia chooses to renew aggression, of conflict, confrontation and consequences for Russia."" Blinken said President Joe Biden had asked his team to ""take stock"" of the situation after intense negotiations with allies but also conversations with Russia, and to ""reaffirm"" the US' commitment to Ukraine. ""I strongly, strongly hope that we can keep this on a diplomatic and peaceful path, but ultimately, that's going to be President Putin's decision,"" he said. The top US diplomat will later travel to Berlin to meet with his German counterpart to discuss efforts to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine, before Blinken meets on Friday with Lavrov. Blinken and Lavrov plan to discuss Russia's military build-up and its demands for security guarantees, in what will be the first high-level meeting between Russia and the United States since the diplomatic talks last week. Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops near Ukraine, transferred more Iskander operational-tactical missiles to the border, and increased its intelligence activity against the country, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest intelligence assessment that was shared exclusively Tuesday with CNN. The Kremlin has continued to deny it is planning an attack, while demanding that the US and its Western partners rule out further NATO eastward expansion, guarantee that Ukraine would never join the block, and prevent NATO from establishing military bases in post-Soviet countries.",29,0.7165734900182177,4.059087665259543,-3.342514175241326,26

Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, said that after seizing the servers, investigators have identified ""more than 100 businesses"" that were at risk of being hacked by cybercriminals, including ransomware groups. The crackdown targeted a popular virtual private networking (VPN) service that police say cybercriminals used to cover their tracks while breaching numerous organizations and trying to extort them. It's the latest effort by North American and European police to bust ransomware groups that have threatened critical infrastructure on both continents. US and European enforcement agencies in the fall arrested two people in Ukraine who allegedly made multimillion-dollar ransom demands following hacks of European and US organizations. The 10-country sting announced Tuesday involved police from Germany to the United Kingdom to Ukraine. A note from investigators on Tuesday greeted visitors to the website of VPNLab.net, the targeted VPN service: ""THIS DOMAIN HAS BEEN SEIZED."" The note said that law enforcement would continue combing through the VPN data in an effort to track the hackers. ""The cybercriminals using this VPN were committing attacks globally,"" Europol spokesperson Claire Georges told CNN in an email. The administrator of a popular Russian and English-language cybercrime forum with over 180,000 registered users has advertised the VPN service since 2009, according to Mark Arena, CEO of cybersecurity firm Intel 471. The news comes as US officials say they believe Russia, in a rare move, has arrested the person responsible for the ransomware attack on a major US pipeline operator last May. Russia has historically been reluctant to curb cybercriminals operating from its soil. It is unclear if the arrest will see the individual, whom US officials have not identified, spend any time behind bars.",3,7.555130131657489,6.979957157463879,0.5751729741936096,18

""I do. I do, because I think (Russia President Vladimir) Putin again smells weakness here,"" Rep. Michael McCaul, a Republican of Texas, told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" when asked whether he thinks there's a new cold war happening. His comments come after CNN reported the US has information that indicates Russia has prepositioned a group of operatives to potentially conduct a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to create a pretext for an invasion. ""He knows that if he's ever going to invade Ukraine, now is the time. I hope he doesn't make that miscalculation. But the fact is, if he does invade Ukraine, what is the United States, what is our commander-in-chief prepared to do to stop it?"" McCaul said. ""If Putin sees deterrence coming back from the United States and our NATO allies, he may second guess his calculation to invade Ukraine. Now Ukraine is the breadbasket of Russia. Putin wants to restore the glory of the old Soviet empire. He's been wanting to do this for quite some time."" McCaul added: ""I'm not seeing a lot of deterrence. I'm seeing some tough rhetoric, but not a lot of action ... you have to put things on the table like sanctions, you have to talk about more arm sales, weapon sales to Ukraine."" The congressman's warning comes after a week's worth of diplomatic meetings between Russian and Western officials over Russia's amassing of tens of thousands of troops along Ukraine's border failed to achieve any breakthroughs. Russia would not commit to de-escalating and American and NATO officials said Moscow's demands -- including that NATO never admit Ukraine into the alliance -- were non-starters. Following the failed talks, Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, told reporters the ""drumbeat of war is sounding loud and the rhetoric has gotten rather shrill."" ""We have to take this very seriously,"" Carpenter said of the massing of Russian troops along the border with Ukraine. ""We have to prepare for the eventuality that there could be an escalation.""

2022-01-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/16/europe/ukraine-malware-microsoft-warning-intl/index.html,Microsoft finds 'destructive' malware in Ukraine,"Destructive malware capable of wiping data has appeared on dozens of computer systems at Ukrainian organizations, including government agencies, non-profits and technology organizations, Microsoft has warned. The disclosure is an added worry for Ukrainian government agencies after many of their websites were hacked this week and replaced with threatening messages to Ukrainians that their data had been compromised. While it is unclear who was responsible for the dual cybersecurity incidents, they come as Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukraine border and after talks between the West and Moscow have failed to deescalate the situation. The ""destructive"" computer code represents ""an elevated risk to any government agency, non-profit or enterprise located or with systems in Ukraine,"" Microsoft said in a blog post Saturday. Microsoft researchers said the computer code was designed to look like ransomware, but that it lacked some of the common features of ransomware and was ""inconsistent with cybercriminal ransomware activity."" Scores of Ukrainian government websites were hacked between Thursday and Friday, many of them apparently via a single software provider named Kitsoft. The Kyiv-based firm said Friday it was helping government websites restore connectivity. Ukrainian officials have said no personal data was leaked in the hacks. Serhiy Demedyuk, deputy secretary of Ukraine's national security and defense council, told Reuters that Ukraine blamed a hacking group linked with Belarusian intelligence for the website hacks. CNN has reached out to the Belarusian foreign ministry for comment. Russia-linked hacking groups have a long history of wreaking havoc in Ukraine. The US Justice Department has blamed Russia's GRU military intelligence agency for cyberattacks in 2015 and 2016 that cut power in parts of Ukraine, and for a crippling piece of malware known as NotPetya. In 2017, NotPetya was unleashed on a Ukrainian accounting software firm, but the malicious code spread to multinational corporations like shipping giant Maersk, costing the global economy billions of dollars.",3,6.049491760204235,3.736271057306309,2.3132207028979264,23
2022-01-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/15/politics/putin-russia-ukraine-border/index.html,Putin presents a profound threat to peace in Europe as 'drumbeat of war' sounds on Russia-Ukraine border,"Europe has a long and bloody history of wars, of borders brutally contested, of nations and empires carving destructive furrows far from home. But a sad harvest of sorrow and loss after the Second World War was followed by decades of relative peace and prosperity, even during a Cold War that did not become hot. Today that peace is being severely tested by Russian President Vladimir Putin as he masses troops on Ukraine's border and diplomats are raising the alarm in stark terms. The US ambassador to the 57 nation, globe straddling Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, Michael Carpenter, warned on Thursday that European security is facing a ""crisis"" and ""the drumbeat of war is sounding loud."" Putin, whose nation buried tens of millions of its own in European wars, is unearthing fresh grievances about the post-World War peace, specifically the role of NATO, the transatlantic defensive alliance and counterpoint to Russia's predecessor, the Soviet Union. Last summer in a 20-page document citing centuries of blood-spattered history, Putin laid claim to Ukraine, which in 1991 regained its independence following the Soviet Union's collapse, stating ""Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are all descendants of Ancient Rus, which was the largest state in Europe."" He concluded ""our spiritual, human and civilizational ties formed for centuries have their origins in the same sources ... true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia."" As commander of the world's fifth largest army, and barely halfway through an expected almost four-decade rule, Putin is setting the stage to stake his claim just as his ancestors did, positioning forces on Ukraine's border awaiting his command. Having already invaded Crimea in 2014, fears Russian troops will again cross the border have never been higher. The past week of talks -- bilaterally with the US in Geneva Monday, with NATO in Brussels Wednesday and culminating at the OSCE in Vienna on Thursday -- which were meant to ease tensions, seem to have achieved the opposite and entrenched Putin's emissaries in hostile rhetoric. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov set the tone on Monday demanding ""ironclad, waterproof, bulletproof, legally binding guarantees, not assurances, not safeguards, guarantees"" that NATO deny Ukraine and others membership and roll back to 1997 lines. Two days later, after NATO talks in Brussels, another deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, threatened force if they don't get what they want. ""We have a set of legal military-technical measures that we will apply if we feel a real threat to [our] security, and we already feel [it],"" he said. By Thursday when talks reached the OSCE, whose territory circumnavigates the northern hemisphere from Russia's easternmost frozen tundra to Alaska's icy western tip and where both Russia and Ukraine are members a diplomatic permafrost had formed. Russia's OSCE ambassador, Alexander Lukashevich, warned of ""a moment of truth"" with ""catastrophic consequences"" if Russia's ""principles are violated."" In Moscow Friday, Putin's long serving Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned ""the West got carried away,"" and tapping into Russian folk law, hinted Putin's diplomacy may have run its course, saying: ""We have been harnessing slowly, but now it's time for us to ride."" The same day, Ukrainians woke to a massive cyberattack taking down government websites. Russia hasn't claimed responsibility, but Europe's top diplomat Josep Borrell left little doubt who he thinks was behind the attack, saying, ""It's difficult to say [who is behind it]. I can't blame anybody as I have no proof, but we can imagine."" By Russian design or the stuttering effects of stalling diplomacy, the talks are seeding spiraling consequences. Borrell promised counter measures to the cyberattack, ""We are going to mobilize all our resources to help Ukraine to tackle this cyberattack. Sadly, we knew it could happen."" In the US, President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday suggested Putin may have given up on talks with none scheduled in the days ahead, and on Friday the US raised the stakes further, charging that Moscow had ""prepositioned a group of operatives"" to execute ""an operation designed to look like an attack on them or Russian-speaking people in Ukraine"" to create a reason for ""a potential invasion,"" according to Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby. The Kremlin strenuously denied the accusation. What happens next? On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky invited Biden and Putin to hold three-way talks to discuss the security situation, according to Ukrainian state media outlet Ukrinform. Lavrov has stated he believes NATO needs to make the next move, ""We are waiting for answers from our colleagues, written answers, put on paper."" But Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary general, told CNN on Wednesday that it's up to Russia to respond to NATO's diplomatic outreach on arms control talks and other reciprocal military agreements. ""We are waiting for the answer to our proposal to convene a meeting addressing a wide range of important issues for European security,"" he said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also indicated the US is waiting on the Russian President. ""Is he going to choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue to resolve some of these problems? Or is he going to pursue confrontation and aggression?"" the secretary asked Thursday. The wait is re-awakening uncomfortable memories for Europeans. Denmark's Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod branded Putin's actions ""totally unacceptable,"" saying he is ""trying to take us back to the coldest, darkest days of the Cold War."" But with Putin seemingly adamant he will not back down, history's shadow is pressing on the shoulders of leaders across the continent who are becoming increasingly aware that fateful decisions may lie ahead.",29,3.1808399848114832,0.8171401929196253,2.363699791891858,26
2022-01-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/europe/ukraine-cyber-attack-government-intl/index.html,Cyberattack hits Ukraine government websites,"Scores of Ukrainian government websites were targeted in a cyberattack with threatening text warning Ukrainians to ""be afraid and wait for the worst"" and alleging their personal information has been hacked. Ukraine claimed Russia was most likely behind the attack, which affected the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies. Oleg Nikolenko, Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman tweeted on Friday that the ""investigation is still ongoing but the Security Service of Ukraine has obtained preliminary indicators suggesting that hacker groups associated with the Russian secret services may stand behind today's massive cyberattack on government websites."" Ukraine's communication intelligence service said in a statement that as many as 70 central and regional authority websites were targeted. The attack appears to be a low-level incident but is symbolic coming at the end of a week of frantic diplomacy involving NATO, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and bilateral talks between Russia and the United States -- all aimed at trying to deescalate tensions on Ukraine's border. ""This is not the first time or even the second time that Ukrainian Internet resources have been attacked since the beginning of the Russian military aggression,"" the Ukrainian Information Ministry said in a statement. Most of the affected state resources have already been restored, according to Ukraine's security service, who said that personal data had not been breached. What happened? Early Friday morning local time, Ukrainian government websites, including that of the Foreign Ministry, displayed dark screens with a threatening text that said Ukrainians' personal information had been hacked. ""Ukrainian! All your personal data has been uploaded to the public network. All data on the computer is destroyed, it is impossible to restore them,"" the message, published in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish, read. ""All information about you has become public, be afraid and wait for the worst. This is for you for your past, present and future. For Volhynia, for the OUN UIA [Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists Ukrainian Insurgent Army], for Galicia, for Polesie and for historical lands,"" the web page read. The UIA and OUN were Ukrainian ultranationalist groups that fought for independence during the Soviet era, while Galicia, Volhynia and Polesie are areas from which they historically drew high levels of support. A statement from Ukraine's Ministry of Culture and Information Policy suggested that the text mentioned the groups and regions as a ""way to conceal the ""Russian footprint"" by hackers."" ""It is obvious that this was done on purpose to cast a shadow over the hacker attack on Poland: Russia and its proxies have been working for a long time to create the quarrel between two friendly neighboring countries,"" the ministry added in a statement. The Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement that although ""provocative messages were posted on the main page of these sites,"" the content of the sites was not changed, adding ""the leakage of personal data, according to preliminary information, did not occur."" The websites of the ministries of education, foreign affairs, sport, energy, agrarian policy, veterans, environment and the state emergency service of Ukraine and the state treasury were targeted, according to state media Ukrinform. The Ministry of Education and Science, whose official website is down, directed citizens to use the ministry's official social media channels on Friday while the issue is being resolved. The head of Ukraine's technical security and intelligence service Yuri Shchigol said almost 70 websites of central and regional authorities had been affected. ""It appears that each of these sites was developed on behalf of the government of Ukraine by a Ukrainian firm named Kitsoft,"" said Matt Olney, director of threat intelligence and interdiction at Talos, the threat intelligence unit of technology giant Cisco, told CNN. ""While obviously unfortunate, we do not see this event alone as indicating an increase or decrease of [cyber] risk in Ukraine,"" he added. Oleksandr Iefremov, the CEO of Kitsoft, said the firm was ""actively involved in restoring"" the government websites that it supports. Not all of the Ukrainian government websites affected by the hack run Kitsoft software, Iefremov said in a statement sent to CNN. ""We test vulnerabilities, bugs, and update government websites that are supported by Kitsoft company in a timely manner,"" Iefremov said. ""Unfortunately, not all the customers order website support, so we dіd not have access to them."" While the Ukrainian government has suggested Russian involvement in the hack, outside experts say they cannot make that attribution without forensic evidence. Oleh Derevianko, founder of Kyiv-based cybersecurity firm ISSP, said he wasn't surprised by the defacement of government websites. ""It's a good illustration how you can use a simple defacement attack as an informational operation tool when everyone is so nervous and agitated about potential invasion,"" he told CNN. Attacks add to an 'already tense situation' The EU's chief diplomat Josep Borrell condemned the cyberattack, warning it contributes to the ""already tense situation"" in the region. During a joint press conference with the French foreign minister in Brest, France, on Friday, Borrell, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said he convened an emergency meeting upon learning of the attack on Ukrainian government websites. ""Such actions aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian contribute to further escalation of the already tense situation,"" Borrell said. When asked if Russian governmental or non-governmental actors were behind the attacks, Borrell responded that although he didn't want to ""point fingers"" there ""is a certain probability as to where they came from."" Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Friday that it is ""too early to draw conclusions"" as to who is behind the attack, but said there is a ""long record of Russian cyber assaults against Ukraine in the past."" Separately, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense alleged in a statement Friday that Russian special services are preparing provocations against servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces in order to accuse Ukraine. The statement from the ministry's intelligence directorate said: ""The military units of the aggressor country and its satellites receive orders to prepare for such provocations."" CNN has contacted Russia's defense ministry for comment on both allegations. Tensions with Russia at a high The US and Russia met this week for high-stakes talks aimed at averting a war, as Russia continued to mass troops near Ukraine's borders amid a dispute over NATO activities in Eastern Europe and the prospect that Ukraine could join the military alliance. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with the Russian military build-up spurring fears that Moscow could launch an invasion in the coming weeks or months. Ukraine has said that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion, and Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. A senior US official warned that the ""drumbeat of war is sounding loud"" after a week of talks ended Thursday without clear breakthroughs. Russian officials suggested they were poised to abandon discussions over the US and NATO's refusal to entertain Moscow's key demands: a guarantee that Ukraine will never be permitted to join NATO and that the alliance roll back its expansion in Eastern Europe. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a press briefing that while Moscow's proposals were ""aimed at reducing the military confrontation, de-escalating the overall situation in Europe, exactly the opposite is happening in the West."" He said: ""We absolutely do not accept the appearance of the North Atlantic Alliance on our borders, especially taking into account the course pursued by the Ukrainian leadership - both by the former and the current ones. These are truly the red lines and they know it.""",3,1.245915148406667,2.043451610268434,-0.7975364618617671,23
2022-01-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/us-russia-colonial-pipeline-hack-arrest/index.html,US officials believe Russia arrested hacker responsible for Colonial Pipeline attack,"The US believes that Russia's domestic intelligence agency has arrested the hacker responsible for the May ransomware attack that forced a major US fuel pipeline to shut down for days, a senior Biden administration official told reporters Friday. It appears to mark a rare instance of US-Russian cooperation against a major cybercrime group, following direct appeals from President Joe Biden to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The cyberattack against Colonial Pipeline in May prompted the company to preemptively shut down its fuel distribution operations, leading to widespread shortages at gas stations along the East Coast. The official spoke to reporters after Russia's FSB intelligence agency said Friday that, at the behest of US authorities, it had detained multiple people associated with REvil, a type of ransomware that has cost US firms millions of dollars. The US and Russia do not have an extradition treaty. While Russian authorities said those apprehended would be prosecuted, the extent to which that will happen is unclear. The FSB said Russian authorities had seized millions of dollars, raided the homes of 14 people and detained an unspecified number of people connected with the so-called REvil ransomware. REvil was used in damaging hacks on a top US meat supplier in May and US software provider Kaseya in July, with the latter infecting up to 1,500 businesses around the world, US officials have previously said. The FSB's announcement follows a week of talks among the US, its European allies and Russia that failed to reach a breakthrough over the tens of thousands of troops Russia has amassed near Ukraine's border. ""In our mind, this is not related to what's happening with Russia and Ukraine,"" the senior administration official said. But some cybersecurity analysts pointed to the timing of the FSB announcement, which comes as the US has threatened severe sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine. ""This is Russian ransomware diplomacy,"" Dmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert who is chairman of the non-profit Silverado Policy Accelerator, told CNN. ""It is a signal to the United States: If you don't enact severe sanctions against us for invasion of Ukraine, we will continue to cooperate with you on ransomware investigations.""",3,2.5732743628258503,4.385064365760914,-1.8117900029350635,18
2022-01-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/13/politics/russia-talks-diplomacy-uncertain-thursday-osce/index.html,US warns Russia is sounding 'drumbeats of war' against Ukraine as crisis talks end with no breakthrough,"A senior US official warned Thursday that the ""drumbeat of war is sounding loud"" following a week's worth of diplomacy between the West and Russia that wrapped up Thursday. The effort ended without clear breakthroughs over the tens of thousands of Russian troops amassed on the Ukrainian border, leaving prospects for future diplomacy and de-escalation in doubt as Russian officials suggested they could soon turn to military options. Both US and Russian officials sounded a pessimistic note over the talks following Thursday's meeting in Vienna at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It was the third session that capped a week of intensive meetings that the United States and its NATO allies hoped could spur Russia to pursue a path of ""de-escalation and diplomacy"" rather than mobilizing the tens of thousands of Russian troops whose presence has swelled along Ukraine's borders. But Russian officials reacted with frustration and impatience coming out of the meetings, suggesting they were poised to abandon discussions over the US and NATO's refusal to entertain Moscow's key demands: A guarantee that Ukraine will never be permitted to join NATO and that the alliance roll back its expansion in Eastern Europe. The US and its NATO allies have repeatedly said such proposals from Moscow are non-starters. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov suggested the talks had reached ""a dead-end or a difference in approaches"" because the US and NATO would not address Moscow's demands about Ukraine never joining NATO, he said, according to Russian state media TASS. Ryabkov said he didn't see a reason for the two sides to continue talks, even though the US has suggested they would continue beyond this week. Following Thursday's session, the US Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter told reporters that the ""drumbeat of war is sounding loud and the rhetoric has gotten rather shrill"" ""We have to take this very seriously,"" Carpenter said of the massing of Russian troops along the border with Ukraine. ""We have to prepare for the eventuality that there could be an escalation."" Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, the OSCE chairman, warned after Thursday's meeting that the ""risk of war in the OSCE area is now greater than ever before in the last 30 years."" The diplomatic efforts this week -- which included separate sessions between Russia and the US, NATO and the OSCE -- were aimed at pulling back Russia from a potential invasion of Ukraine. But Russia did not commit to pulling back the more than 100,000 troops now along the border, and the Russian military conducted live-fire exercises along the border this week as the talks were ongoing. 'The jury's out on which path Vladimir Putin is going to choose' US officials made clear heading into the talks they did not know whether Russia was serious about diplomacy or just planned to use the sessions as a pretext for military action. ""The jury's out on which path Vladimir Putin is going to choose,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday in an interview with MSNBC. ""Is he going to choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue to resolve some of these problems or is he going to pursue confrontation and aggression?"" National Security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House Thursday that the US and its allies remain prepared for any outcome following this week's talks. ""The discussions were frank and direct. They were useful. They gave us and our allies things to consider; they gave Russia things to consider,"" Sullivan said. ""We will now reflect and consult with allies and partners on how to proceed,"" Sullivan told reporters at the White House. Sullivan said that the Biden administration planned to share information soon about Russian disinformation operations that could lay the groundwork for a pretext to invade Ukraine. ""Our intelligence community has developed information, which has now been downgraded, that Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating the pretext for an invasion,"" Sullivan said. A senior US official said that in the last several days Russia has ""continued to add capacity"" near the border. The official said that it wasn't a ""substantial"" number of troops or equipment, but it's a signal that Kremlin is not de-escalating. Russia's next move still unclear It's still unclear what the US plans to do if Russia doesn't de-escalate but also doesn't invade Ukraine. Throughout the week, US officials have said Russia will face consequences like they have never seen if an invasion happens. But the Biden administration is not planning to impose any costs on Russia as a deterrent. A senior State Department official said there is nothing that would change that approach. ""I don't think there's any desire to impose sanctions or consequences in advance of Russian action on the ground. I don't think that would be a productive way to go,"" the official told CNN. ""I think we maintain leverage if we reserve the right to impose those consequences in the aftermath of an escalation."" The head of the US delegation, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, told reporters after the talks at NATO that the Russians themselves may not know yet what their next move is. Throughout this week's talks, the US has repeatedly argued that diplomacy can't happen unless Russia de-escalates, which Sherman on Monday said the US defined as Russia returning its troops to barracks or telling the US ""that exercises are ongoing and what their purpose is."" After Wednesday's meeting at NATO, Sherman said Russia had not committed to any de-escalation. Top Biden administration officials have made clear that they expect talk to continue in the near future, without providing details for what those talks might look like. ""We would expect to have additional engagement with the Russian Federation in the coming days. We hope that engagement takes place, we hope this diplomatic track continues, but even more importantly, we hope it bears fruit,"" State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said on Wednesday. Russia says US demands are 'unacceptable' Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov responded Thursday that the US demands were ""unacceptable."" ""I do not think we need to explain how absolutely unacceptable such demands are, and, of course, we will not even discuss them,"" Lavrov said. US officials have expressed hope that discussions over areas of mutual interest between Russia and the US -- including nuclear weapons, intermediate range missiles and transparency over military exercises -- could keep the diplomatic conversations going. NATO leaders noted that Wednesday was the first time Russia had agreed to a meeting with the alliance in two years and they sat through the four hour-long meeting, which was longer than had been scheduled. ""I think the reality is that I will say that the Russian delegation sat through nearly four hours of a meeting where 30 nations spoke, and they did, which is not an easy thing to do,"" she said Wednesday. But if that gave the impression Russia might have been open to compromise positions, Russia quickly poured cold water on it. ""The US and its NATO allies are not ready to meet Russia halfway on the key issues,"" Ryabkov said Thursday, according to state news agency TASS. ""The main problem is that the United States and its NATO allies, under no guise, for any reason are not ready to meet our key demands."" Blinken had warned before the talks that no breakthroughs were expected this week ""in an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head."" As Russia and NATO appeared to talk past each other, the language they used illustrated how far apart they remain. Russia had proposed specific treaty language in the weeks ahead of the meetings and called them ""negotiations,"" while Sherman countered that no formal terms were put forward in what she described as ""discussions."" Sherman said earlier in the week that she did not know if the Russians had come to the table for the three days of talks in good faith, or as a pretext in an attempt to justify future military action. ""If Russia walks away, however, it will be quite apparent they were never serious about pursuing diplomacy at all,"" she said. ""That is why collectively we are preparing for every eventuality.""",29,1.6104765530792302,0.2886815060006334,1.3217950470785969,2
2022-01-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/europe/nato-russia-council-summit-ukraine-intl/index.html,US says Russia made no commitments to de-escalate Ukraine crisis after latest round of talks,"Russia has not committed to de-escalate on the Ukrainian border after two rounds of diplomatic talks this week, Deputy US Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Wednesday, as the US acknowledged it's still unclear whether Moscow intends to use the talks this week as a pretext to claim that diplomacy cannot work. Sherman told reporters that Wednesday's meeting between NATO and Russia ended with a ""sober challenge from the NATO allies to Russia"" to respond to the opportunities offered by the international community to de-escalate the situation on the border with Ukraine and choose the path of diplomacy. But Sherman, who spoke forcefully about the West's unified message to Moscow following the roughly four-hour session in Brussels, made clear the US and its Western allies don't yet know what Russian President Vladimir Putin's aims are following the diplomatic meetings, with more than 100,000 Russian troops positioned on the Ukrainian border. In statements Wednesday, Russian officials suggested Moscow could resort to military action if political efforts fail. That warning came a day after the Russian military conducted live-fire exercises along the border. As the talks this week, the US has finalized sanctions options in the event that Russia invades Ukraine, senior administration officials said on Wednesday. ""When live fire exercises are reported this morning. What is this about?"" Sherman said, referring to reports about Russian exercises. ""Is this about invasion? Is this about intimidation? Is this about trying to be subversive? I don't know. But it is not conducive to getting diplomatic solutions."" Asked by CNN's Alex Marquardt if the Russians had made any commitments to de-escalate, Sherman said they did not. ""There was no commitment to de-escalation, no,"" she said, before pausing and adding: ""Nor was there a statement that there would not be."" Sherman suggested that the Russians themselves may not even know how they intend to use or act upon this week's diplomatic talks with the US and NATO. She said that the US believes that progress can be made -- if Russia engages on issues where there are overlapping interests. ""There is plenty to work on, where we have places where we can enhance mutual security. There are some places we cannot. But there is progress that can be made,"" Sherman said. Sherman told CNN's Christianne Amanpour later Wednesday that she believed Putin amassed troops on the border of Ukraine in order to ""put pressure on Europe and the United States, to put pressure on the euro Atlantic ambition, to... intimidate, to coerce, and to say 'I've got sticks I can bring to this discussion' as well."" Russia says situation is becoming 'intolerable' Following Wednesday's meetings, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko warned that Moscow would resort to military measures if the political course fails to fend off threats to its security, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti. ""We have a set of legal military-technical measures that we will apply if we feel a real threat to (our) security, and we already feel (it), if our territory is considered as an object for targeted strike weapons,"" Grushko told reporters, according to Russian state media. ""Of course, we cannot agree with this. We will take all necessary measures to fend off the threat by military means if it does not work out with political means."" Russia's deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin also issued a statement Wednesday sounding pessimistic about the talks, saying it was NATO who was ignoring Russia's proposals to de-escalate -- and warning that could lead to conflicts. ""The Russian side has repeatedly proposed to the alliance to take measures to de-escalate the situation,"" Fomin said. ""On the part of the alliance, Russian initiatives were ignored. This creates prerequisites for incidents and conflicts, undermines the foundations of security."" Grushko said that the Russian side told NATO countries the current situation was becoming ""intolerable"" for Moscow. During Wednesday's roughly meeting -- which went longer than scheduled -- Sherman said that the US and its NATO allies once again made clear Russia's demand Ukraine never be permitted to join NATO was a non-starter. Sherman called it ""hard to understand"" how Russia could feel threatened by Ukraine when it has the largest conventional military in Europe. Wednesday's session with the NATO-Russia Council was the second of three planned for this week. The US delegation led by Sherman met with the Russians on Monday, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will hold a session with Russia on Thursday in Vienna. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday that the meeting between NATO and Russia over the situation in Ukraine was ""not an easy discussion"" and that ""differences will not be easy to bridge,"" but added that NATO allies and Russia ""expressed the need to resume dialogue."" ""We had a very serious and direct exchange on the situation in and around Ukraine and the implications for European security,"" he told reporters. ""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues. Our differences will not be easy to bridge but it is a positive sign that all NATO allies and Russia sat down around the same table and engaged on substantial topics."" US finalizes sanctions options The Biden administration has sanctions targets and implementation measures ""ready to go to be issued when those tanks cross the border,"" a senior administration official said. ""The final package will depend upon exactly what scenario we are facing,"" the official said. ""But we are no longer at the point where we have just a memo that lays out options. We have concrete actions that we are ready to hit the return key on."" As CNN previously reported, the White House over the last several weeks had been analyzing the impacts various sanctions options would have not just on Russia but also on the European and American economies. Biden administration officials said Wednesday the US and its allies determined that while severe economic sanctions will likely have global economic ramifications, any spillover can be managed. ""The European financial system and its overall economy are in far better health than in 2014, particularly in the banking sector,"" one of the officials said. The US is also aware of the risk that Putin tries to retaliate against any economic sanctions by weaponizing the export of Russian gas to Europe, which relies heavily on Russian energy supplies. One of the officials said that if Putin went down that path, it would ""stiffen the resolve of Europe to find supplies elsewhere."" ""We are well aware of the potential impact of a reduction of Russian energy supply, both in the European market"" and globally, the official said, adding that a range of contingency options for that scenario are being developed. Sources familiar with those contingencies said they include fuel switching, in which certain energy sources are replaced with others to meet demands, as well as the increased import of liquid natural gas from LNG-producing countries like Norway, the Netherlands, Qatar, and the UAE. European authorities are also looking at how much of a buffer their storages would provide in the event Russia shut off exports, the sources said. They emphasized that Russia's economy is also highly dependent upon gas export revenues. Asked about efforts by some Republican members of Congress, particularly Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, to sanction the Russia-Germany gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 and essentially kill the project, the senior administration officials said they believe doing so now would reduce the West's leverage over Russia. Even before the latest Russian troop buildup on the Ukraine border, however, the Biden administration waived additional, congressionally mandated sanctions on Nord Stream 2, arguing that doing so would damage US relations with Germany, which sees the pipeline as a commercial project. Russian troops conduct live-fire exercises Wednesday's meeting comes as the two sides are stuck in deadlock, with fears mounting that Russia could launch an invasion into Ukraine. Moscow has dismissed such claims. However, Russia has been amassing as many as 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian frontier, and on the eve of the talks, the military began live-fire drills in regions close to the border. The United States, NATO and their allies are pushing Russia to de-escalate the situation. Moscow has demanded security guarantees from the US and NATO, including a binding pledge that NATO won't expand further east and will not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance -- something NATO is not willing to do. ""At this point, let me be very, very clear -- no one is suggesting that we alter NATO policy on enlargement,"" US Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told CNN on Tuesday. Rather than being framed as a bilateral NATO-Russia meeting, Wednesday's gathering saw each of NATO's 30 member states and Russia represented equally, in a forum of 31. The meeting is the second of three key engagements between the West and Russia this week. On Monday, representatives from the US and Russia sat down in Geneva for more than seven hours of discussions. The marathon talks, which the White House described as ""frank and forthright,"" did not produce a breakthrough. Another round of talks between Russia and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) -- of which the US is a member -- are scheduled in Vienna on Thursday. Ukraine said Tuesday that it was confident that the US and other NATO countries would not make a decision ""on the fate"" of the country ""behind our backs"" during the meetings.",29,0.7311379013280237,0.5748806587396088,0.1562572425884149,4
2022-01-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/politics/ambassador-nato-julianne-smith-russia-ukraine-talks-cnntv/index.html,US ambassador to NATO says NATO and Russia 'committed to dialogue' ahead of talks Wednesday,"The United States, NATO allies and Russia are all ""committed to dialogue"" ahead of Wednesday's high-stakes meeting to discuss Russia's military buildup along the Ukrainian border, US Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said Tuesday. ""I think right now, folks feel that both the allies and the Russians, including the United States, all are committed to dialogue at this juncture,"" she told CNN's Alex Marquardt in an exclusive interview from NATO headquarters in Brussels. ""All of the allies are committed to engaging in a dialogue with Russia tomorrow. But simultaneously, the allies are all united in messaging to the Russians that should they decide to further invade Ukraine, they would face massive consequences from NATO and also from the EU as well,"" she said. Wednesday's meeting is the second of three key engagements with Russia meant to defuse the growing threat posed by Russia to neighboring Ukraine as Moscow amasses thousands of troops along the border. On Monday, the representatives and Russia sat down in Geneva for more than seven hours of discussions. In the wake of Monday's talks, Russia has continued to demand guarantees that Ukraine never be allowed to join NATO. Smith told CNN that ""frankly, I don't see a lot of compromise"" on the issue of NATO's approach to enlargement. ""At this point, let me be very, very clear -- no one is suggesting that we alter NATO policy on enlargement,"" Smith said. ""The door remains open. No one has the right to kick the door shut. And any decision about enlargement will continue to rest between the NATO alliance and the country in question."" But she said that there will be other issues on the table to discuss with Russia, including an ongoing conversation about placing ""some reciprocal limits"" on military exercises and missiles. Russia has been amassing as many as 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border, and Smith told CNN on Tuesday that the US has not ""seen any clear signs of de-escalation"" from Russia amid the talks. ""Russia is still maintaining about 100,000 forces right on the border with Ukraine. We believe they have plans to bring more forces forward,"" she said. Smith reiterated that the Russians' excuse that they are amassing troops for exercises, ""doesn't really hold water at this point."" ""They claim they're exercising. That seems like an awful lot of forces to have on the border for an exercise and there was no notification of any sort of exercise either. So we're not exactly clear why they're massing forces on the border,"" Smith said. Monday's talks between the US and Russia in Geneva, Switzerland, were ""frank and forthright,"" US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman told reporters. But she said she does not know yet whether Russia is prepared to de-escalate the situation on Ukraine's border.",29,0.3255385551385143,1.149824424577192,-0.8242858694386777,4
2022-01-09,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/09/europe/nato-russia-meeting-intl-cmd/index.html,The West has a rare window to put Putin in his place,"This week may see one of the most significant and defining moments in relations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia since the break-up of the Soviet Union. On Wednesday, representatives from NATO, its 30 member states, and the Russian Federation will meet in Brussels, primarily to discuss the recent military buildup of Russian troops on the border between Russia and Ukraine. US and Russian diplomats also met in Geneva Monday to discuss the crisis as well. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said there are ""two paths,"" and that the option of ""diplomacy and de-escalation"" was one of two the US and international community had laid out for Moscow ahead of the meetings. Blinken met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Stockholm, Sweden, in December amid growing concern among Western powers that Russia was seeking to invade Ukraine. The recent escalation in tension has sparked fears of a repeat of 2014, when Russia forcibly annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. This act, the fact that Russia was able to do it and get away with it, triggered years of serious conversations in policy circles about the role of the West and whether or not it was capable of standing up to Russia. Relations between the West and Russia never rebounded after that point -- instead, almost reaching Cold War-level lows. The NATO-Russia Council, founded in 2002 as a talking shop for cooperation between the West and Russia, has not met in over two years. Blinken said Friday that progress could be made during this week's diplomatic talks between US, European and Russian officials, but that it had to be a ""two-way street"" with Russia deescalating its aggression toward Ukraine. While multiple NATO officials told CNN that, in their view, the fact that Russia has finally agreed to meet is a major concession and a sign that diplomacy could lead to a deescalation, they are also cautious that an increasingly hostile Kremlin might not be meeting in good faith. It was only last month that Moscow published two draft agreements outlining its demands for defusing tensions on the Ukrainian border. Those demands include rolling back NATO deployments in Eastern Europe to some point in the 1990s, meaning many countries that neighbor Russia and were under the control of the Soviet Union would be less protected by the alliance. This, along with a promise of NATO not expanding further east, is an unacceptable demand and a non-starter from NATO's perspective. So what are the Russians hoping for? NATO sources say the demands could be ""deliberately ridiculous to force a rollback on things like admitting new NATO members, pulling the likes of Ukraine and Finland from the mix,"" or could simply be ""a performance that allows Russian officials to say they tried to negotiate in order to justify an escalation to their citizens."" Given both sides' inflexibility, what is the point of the meeting? According to officials from the most vocal and oldest NATO members, Wednesday is an opportunity for the alliance to lay down a firm and unified position: If Russia does escalate tensions, it will face ""serious economic consequences. We will use tools that weren't deployed in 2014."" Officials who spoke to CNN were not forthcoming on what those tools would be because ""signposting them would give Russia the opportunity to prepare for them, defeating the purpose,"" however it's fair to say that they would be a mixture of hard economic sanctions and even more NATO on Russia's doorstep. Risky as Western hostility might be in provoking Putin, inaction could be worse. ""Capitulating to out-of-this-world demands would make the overall situation much more dangerous, as it would just embolden the Kremlin to act aggressively,"" says Pasi Eronen, research analyst at the Conflict Studies Research Centre. ""Moreover, China and other revisionists are watching the reaction to a Kremlin gamble."" What is notable when talking to officials and experts is a sense that the West is far less scared of Russia than it has been in recent years. Poisonings and assassination of Russian citizens on foreign soil, brutal suppression and imprisonment of political opponents, interference in foreign elections and the annexation of Crimea have all painted an image of Putin as a strong leader who must be feared. Naturally, if you live in Russia or a neighboring nation and have opposed Putin, then he is a scary individual. However, his escalating aggression might in part be down to his diminished power in other areas. ""Putin is an aging autocrat, obsessed with the legacy of his rule, and that of the failure of the Soviet Union,"" says Eronen. ""Russia has been ravaged by Covid-19, and the future of its hydrocarbon export economy looks bleak."" This economic weakness is where the West, if it remains united, may possibly be able to force Putin's hand. ""His country has an economy roughly the same size as New York. If the West properly coordinated economic sanctions against him and against Russian business without fear, he would be backed into a corner very quickly,"" says Bill Browder, a prominent American-born financier whose push for the Magnitsky Act sanctions has infuriated the Kremlin. While the West has imposed sanctions on Russia in recent years for various Kremlin misdeeds, it's fair to say they could have gone further. That's partly why this week is so important: if NATO allies do all get on the same page, it could send the strongest possible message at a critical moment. Just as Putin tries to push his luck again, the West has the opportunity to say in a formal diplomatic setting that it's run out of patience. In order to make any new sanctions more effective than previous attempts to punish Russia, the West must be prepared to suffer some pain. In the past, it has avoided targeting Russian sovereign debt and the energy trade. According to Richard Connolly, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, ""raising the costs of doing business for Russian firms, either by restricting access to capital, or by restrictions to accessing technologies,"" could have a bigger impact on the Russian economy and on Putin's inner circle than targeting individuals because ""most critical Russian business is in some way connected to Kremlin."" He also says that ""imposing secondary sanctions on those that trade with Russia"" in things like energy, arms and strategic goods could do similar levels of harm that secondary sanctions have done to Iran. On the thornier question of traditional hard power and the potential expansion of NATO, some believe that the allies have reason to feel bullish when they meet with the Russians on Wednesday. ""We need to join forces and not be afraid. Putin is afraid -- not us. He is afraid of his own people, afraid of democratic elections,"" says Rasa Juknevičienė, Lithuania's former defense minister. She believes that now is the time to accelerate Ukraine's accession to NATO. ""Europe cannot return to the times of Hitler and Stalin, when nations were divided. Ukrainians, not the Kremlin, have to decide, what will be the future of Ukraine. The success of Ukraine would be the best remedy against the Kremlin. They fear it most,"" she adds. Obviously, talks this week will be tense and solving the Ukrainian crisis is not going to be easy. Putin can be at his most dangerous when backed into a corner, observers say, and he is currently juggling multiple foreign-policy crises after Russian troops were deployed to neighboring Kazakhstan to quell unrest following violent anti-government protests. A running theme over the past few years has been Putin leaping on Western errors in judgment -- from the Afghanistan withdrawal to inaction in Syria -- and using whatever power he has to bolster his reputation as a powerful leader. And as multiple NATO officials conceded, Putin cares about Ukraine a lot more than many in the West and will have limitless patience to get what he wants if he senses weakness. The West goes into this week with so many strategic advantages over Russia, it should on paper be relatively easy to force Putin's hand toward deescalation in the east of Europe. However, Putin hasn't remained in power for over 20 years for no reason. If the West is to successfully leverage its position at this critical moment and cut Putin down to size, its unity must be uncrackable. A repeat of the mistakes of 2014 could create an even more dangerous version of the Russian leader if he is able to stare down the most powerful alliance on earth.",29,2.265852263255255,1.0979745866166042,1.167877676638651,20
2022-01-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/07/politics/blinken-russia-talks/index.html,Blinken says talks with Russia on Ukraine crisis need to be a 'two-way street' to be successful,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that progress can be made during next week's diplomatic talks between US, European and Russian officials, but that it had to be a ""two-way street"" with Russia deescalating its aggression toward Ukraine. Speaking following a meeting with NATO foreign ministers Friday, Blinken reiterated that the US and its allies were prepared to address any ""legitimate concerns"" Russia had about NATO's actions if Russia reciprocated. But Blinken accused Russia of attempting to ""draw us into a debate about NATO"" to misdirect from Russia's buildup of forces near Ukraine's border. ""Moscow is simultaneously driving the false narrative that NATO is threatening Russia, that NATO plans to station military infrastructure in Ukraine to stir conflict with Russia, that NATO swore after the cold war not to admit countries in Eastern Europe, and that NATO has broken those promises,"" Blinken said at a news conference at the State Department. ""Each of those claims is false."" Blinken also said that the idea of Ukraine as the aggressor -- which Russia has pushed -- is ""absurd."" Blinken said that Russia currently has ""nearly 100,000 troops today"" built up ""on Ukraine's border"" and has ""plans to mobilize twice that number on very short order."" The NATO Foreign Ministers meeting on Friday was a chance for the US and its allies to coordinate and demonstrate unified opposition to Russian aggression towards Ukraine ahead of what's expected to be a week of intense diplomacy, a US official and two European officials explained. A second US official explained that the sequencing of diplomacy with Russia next week -- with US-Russia talks first, NATO talks with Russia second, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) talks with Russia last -- was very deliberate. The order of events will allow Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who leads the bilateral talks for the US side, to take the temperature of the Russian approach early on in the week and inform allies about what was shared in those initial conversations so that they can develop a game plan together. While US and European officials continue to press that Russia cannot be rewarded for their military buildup -- and that the country must deescalate the situation with Ukraine before anything else can happen -- they also privately acknowledge that Russia will need an off-ramp, US and European officials told CNN. But creating an offramp is tricky, the officials said, because it will need to be something that Russia can herald at home as a win but also something that does not actually award Russia. One area to watch is the possibility of the US moving heavy weaponry that it has in Poland further West given Russian sensitivities about its borders, one European official said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who also spoke Friday after the NATO meeting, said that the alliance welcomed Russia's willingness to ""come to the table and talk"" but was prepared for ""the possibility that diplomacy will fail."" Blinken reiterated on Friday that the US was prepared to dole out ""massive consequences,"" including new economic measures, if Russia's military buildup on Ukraine's border continues. Biden administration officials, however, are still weighing how the US would penalize Russia if it invades Ukraine. On Friday, a news report that the US was developing plans to change its force posture in Eastern Europe if Russia deescalated its aggression toward Ukraine alarmed Baltic states, who began reaching out to US officials asking about how serious it was, two US officials told CNN. The Biden administration forcefully pushed back on the report. ""It is not accurate that the administration is developing options for pulling back U.S. forces in Eastern Europe in preparation for discussions with Russia next week,"" State spokesman Ned Price tweeted. Kazakhstan unrest Next week's talks are occurring amid the backdrop of unrest in Kazakhstan, where the country's leader -- with the help of Russian forces -- has tamped down on protests that turned violent. The situation has the potential to complicate the upcoming talks, though so far White House officials say the Kazakhstan violence will not delay or otherwise change the three sets of talks set to begin in Geneva on Monday. Blinken said Friday that the US remains ""very concerned about the ongoing state of emergency"" in Kazakhstan and has questions about the country's request for peacekeeping forces from the Collective Security Treaty Organization, an alliance of former Soviet states that includes Russia. ""It would seem to me that the Kazakh authorities and government certainly have the capacity to deal appropriately with protests, to do so in a way that respects the rights of protestors while maintaining law and order,"" Blinken said. ""So, it's not clear why they feel the need for any outside assistance."" Blinken said he hoped the Kazakh government to address ""fundamentally economic and political"" problems that he said have led to the protests. His remarks come after the Russian government said that Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the situation in Kazakhstan with CSTO leaders following the arrival of Russian CSTO forces in Kazakhstan. Blinken said that US was not conflating what's happening in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, though he added, ""One lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave.""

2022-01-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/politics/blinken-russia-two-paths/index.html,Blinken says Russia faces 'two paths' ahead of key meetings with US next week,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Wednesday that Russia must de-escalate tensions on the border with Ukraine in order for upcoming diplomatic meetings to succeed, saying ""it's very hard to make actual progress in any of these areas in an atmosphere of escalation and threat, with a gun pointed at Ukraine's head."" The top US diplomat said the path of ""diplomacy and de-escalation"" was one of two the US and international community has laid out for Moscow ahead of a series of meetings aimed at defusing a potential crisis as Russia amasses troops on the border with Ukraine. The other path was that ""of deterrence, including the serious costs, the massive consequences it would incur if it renews its aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken said. Blinken made the comments days before a US delegation sits down with Russian representatives in Geneva, the first of three engagements with Russia next week. He said it was ""important that we begin these conversations,"" but ""if they're going to bear fruit, if they're going to show real progress, that will require de-escalation."" ""The real question is whether Russia is serious about diplomacy, serious about de-escalation,"" Blinken said. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Tuesday that the US-Russia talks were expected to focus on a ""relatively narrow set of bilateral issues,"" while the subsequent meetings at NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will discuss broader issues that impact Europe. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the US plans to raise a variety of Russian misdeeds, including its invasions of neighboring countries, its use of chemical weapons and its election interference, in the engagements next week. ""We don't know what next week's conversations will bring but our approach to the discussions will be pragmatic, results-oriented and we believe there are areas we can make progress on with Moscow, make progress on if they come to the table ready to do that,"" she said. Blinken said Wednesday that ""if Russia is serious about pursing diplomacy and de-escalation, that there are things that all of us can do relatively quickly to build greater confidence and to reduce some of the concerns that we have."" He did not give specific details about what those confidence building measures could be. ""There are also issues that could be on the table that would take some time to work through, particularly for example when it comes to arms control,"" he said. ""You don't come up with an arms control agreement in a matter of weeks."" Speaking alongside his German counterpart on Wednesday, Blinken warned that a Russian invasion could mean a shutdown the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany. He noted that the pipeline ""does not have gas flowing through it at present and if Russia renews its aggression toward Ukraine, it would certainly be difficult to see gas flowing through it in the future."" ""Some may see Nord Stream 2 as leverage that Russia can use against Europe; in fact, it's leverage for Europe to use against Russia,"" he said. Blinken also condemned Russia's ""false narrative that Ukraine seeks to provoke a conflict with Russia."" ""That's like the fox saying it had no choice to attack the henhouse because somehow the hens presented a threat to it,"" he said.",29,0.5678798491580482,1.193156152608107,-0.6252763034500587,2
2021-12-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/28/politics/us-russia-security-talks/index.html,US and Russia to talk Ukraine and security issues next month,"US and Russian officials have agreed to sit down for security talks on January 10, a spokesman for the US National Security Council confirmed Tuesday, amid tensions over Ukraine. Russia had amassed troops near the Ukraine border over the last few months, which US intelligence has assessed as preparation for a full-scale invasion in early 2022. The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement Saturday that 10,000 troops had return to their permanent bases after completing training near the Ukrainian border. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Russia and threatened economic sanctions over a potential invasion of Ukraine, saying that the US is ""ready to act if and when we need to,"" while the US also pursues diplomatic engagement with Russia. President Joe Biden appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month to de-escalate tensions. Russia has been demanding security guarantees from the US and NATO, including a binding pledge that NATO won't expand further east and will not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance. Biden has previously signaled that the US will not make any concessions on either NATO or Ukraine's future. ""President Biden's approach on Ukraine has been clear and consistent: Unite the alliance behind two tracks: deterrence and diplomacy. We are unified as an Alliance on the consequences Russia would face if it moves on Ukraine. But we are also unified in our willingness to engage in principled diplomacy with Russia,"" the NSC spokesman said in a statement. Russia and NATO also intend to hold a separate meeting on January 12, both the NSC spokesman and a NATO press officer confirmed to CNN. Both sides are also expected to engage during a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe scheduled for January 13, according to the US spokesman. ""When we sit down to talk, Russia can put its concerns on the table, and we will put our concerns on the table with Russia's activities as well,"" the NSC spokesman said. ""We will adhere to the principle of 'nothing about our Allies and partners without our Allies and partners, including Ukraine.' There will be areas where we can make progress, and areas where we will disagree. That's what diplomacy is about."" US officials plan to consult with Ukraine regularly on the side as the negotiations take place next month, a White House official told CNN, since Ukraine is not a member of two of the three bodies set to meet in early January to discuss the country's future and Russia's demands that NATO not expand further eastward. Asked why the White House plans to use the US-Russia strategic stability dialogue -- traditionally reserved for nuclear arms talks -- for talks about Ukraine and NATO, the official said the administration wanted to use an existing format as a vehicle for the talks instead of creating a new one specifically for that purpose. The US and Russia are still going back and forth over the agenda. The official said the White House believes talks would be more productive in an environment of de-escalation, but said the status of the talks were not contingent upon Russia drawing down. The White House still believes diplomacy is the most responsible path forward ""even if we don't get everything we want,"" the official said.

2021-12-25,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/25/world/meanwhile-in-america-december-22-intl/index.html,"30 years after USSR fell, there's tension between US and Russia this Christmas","For once, 30 years ago, Christmas really did herald an era of peace. The Soviet Union finally dissolved when its last leader Mikhail Gorbachev resigned on December 25, 1991. Its demise capped the Cold War between Communism and the West, in which hundreds of millions had lived within a wailing four-minute warning of nuclear annihilation. But this festive season, exactly three decades on, brings the gravest showdown between NATO and Russia since the red hammer and sickle flag was lowered over the Kremlin. President Vladimir Putin, for whom the Soviet collapse was a historic shaming, has Europe on edge, methodically building Russian forces on Ukraine's border as fears of invasion mount. While the West and Russia have had their awkward moments since 1991 -- over Serbia, Libya and Georgia -- the current confrontation is the most serious yet because Putin is consciously challenging the post-Cold War European order. After failing to crush pro-Western impulses in the former Soviet socialist republic of Ukraine, politically and diplomatically, he is threatening to do so by force with an incursion that would dwarf the annexation of Crimea in 2014. The Biden administration would much prefer to tackle rising China than age-old conflicts in Europe. But Putin is a master in testing the resolve of adversaries who are distracted and divided as questions linger over Western staying power after the debacle in Afghanistan. He's demanded security guarantees, including an assurance Ukraine will never join NATO and the withdrawal of alliance troops from former Warsaw Pact members who joined the alliance. These speak to a Russian sense of being threatened following NATO expansion but are seen by the West as an attempt to recreate a Soviet-style sphere of influence in Eastern Europe it could never accept. The US and Europe are offering to talk, apparently hoping to forestall an invasion while giving no sense of concessions that would fundamentally reshape the continent's security. They are painting a harsh picture of costs that would follow an invasion. Moscow will have taken note of a column by Washington Post journalist David Ignatius that revealed debate in Washington over an Afghanistan-style US funded insurgency against Russia in Ukraine. The fact officials are even gaming out a cataclysmic proxy war between the US and Russia encapsulates the foreboding mood of a Yuletide when Europe's long-stilled and murderous conflicts are rumbling again. 'The age of spheres of influence is over' While NATO is ready to engage in ""meaningful dialogue"" with Russia, it's not giving an inch to Putin's apparent effort to recreate old Moscow's hegemony over its Soviet-era neighbors, the alliance's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warns. ""The build-up continues,"" Stoltenberg said, of Russia's mobilization on Ukraine's borders, warning that any further aggression against the country would ""carry a very high price."" ""The age of spheres of influence is over,"" he added. We'll see what Putin thinks about that.",29,3.857940560481236,5.00905211380192,-1.1511115533206846,16

The 16 governments, including France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany, said they were aware of ""the involvement of the Russian Federation government in providing material support to the deployment of the Wagner group in Mali and call on Russia to revert to a responsible and constructive behavior in the region."" The Wagner group, a notorious Russian paramilitary company, and associated military contractors have been previously deployed to eastern Ukraine, Syria, Libya, Mozambique and the Central African Republic, according to multiple CNN investigations. Earlier this week, flight-tracking data showed a Russian Air Force Tu-154 flying to the Malian capital, Bamako, from Benghazi in Libya, where Wagner has had a presence in support of forces led by Khalifa Haftar, a renegade general who leads the self-styled Libyan National Army. The aircraft belonged to the Russian Air Force 223rd Flight. The Russian Defense Ministry had previously signed a contract, details of which were seen by CNN, with a company owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin for the use of transport aircraft of the 223rd Flight. Prigozhin, an oligarch so close to the Kremlin that he is known as President Vladimir Putin's ""chef,"" is thought to be the driving force behind the Wagner group. The European states said the deployment to Mali ""can only further deteriorate the security situation in West Africa. CNN reported earlier this year on human rights abuses, including arbitrary killings and torture of civilians, by Russian mercenaries in Central African Republic. Last week, the European Union imposed sanctions against Wagner; eight individuals associated with the group; and three entities connected to it because of what it called ""serious human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings."" Mali has faced a long-running jihadi insurgency which has killed thousands of civilians.

""We have been clear that there will be significant consequences"" if Russia attacks, the official said. The penalties would be coordinated closely with US allies and partners and would severely damage Russia's economy, the official said. Such a move would also result in NATO capabilities being moved closer to Russia. In a statement posted to Twitter on Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss used similar language, emphasizing that any incursion would be ""a massive strategic mistake and would be met with strength, including coordinated sanctions with our allies."" She condemned Russia's ""aggressive and inflammatory rhetoric"" against Ukraine and NATO, adding that the UK's support for Ukraine was ""unwavering."" The US and Russia both indicated on Thursday that the ball is in the other's court when it comes to deterring an invasion of Ukraine, showing little sign that a diplomatic agreement is imminent as Russian President Vladimir Putin has continued to mass forces near Ukraine's border -- despite a direct warning by President Joe Biden earlier this month to de-escalate. Speaking just hours after Putin's marathon year-end news conference, in which he said Russia's actions will depend on the US's and NATO's ""unconditional ensuring of Russia's security today and in the future,"" the US official said the Biden administration is prepared to discuss some of Russia's concerns. But the official said Russia has made some demands ""that they know we can never agree to."" And in an apparent rebuke of Russian officials' insistence in recent days that it would engage only in bilateral talks with the US, the official said any dialogue ""must also take place in full coordination with our allies."" Still, the official said, ""the Biden administration is willing to engage with Russia through multiple channels as soon as early January."" A date and time for the discussions has not been set yet. Putin blames West for growing tensions In his annual year-end news conference on Thursday, Putin deflected when asked whether Russia plans to invade Ukraine. ""How would the Americans react if, on their frontier with Canada, we deployed our missiles?"" he told reporters. ""It's a question of security, and you know our red lines."" ""They just deceived us blatantly. Five waves of NATO expansion. And there you go -- they're now in Romania and Poland, with weapons systems,"" Putin added. White House press secretary Jen Psaki pushed back on Putin's comments on Thursday: ""Well, facts are a funny thing, and facts make clear that the only aggression we're seeing at the border of Russia and Ukraine is the military buildup by the Russians and the bellicose rhetoric from the leader of Russia."" Psaki added that NATO ""is a defensive alliance, not an aggressive alliance. There is no evidence to the contrary, to suggest anything to the contrary, from the United States or NATO members, and of course our efforts are to work with and defend our NATO partners."" Adding to the flurry of diplomatic activity surrounding the crisis, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with both Truss and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday about the Russian aggression and the consequences they would be prepared to impose in the event of an invasion. The White House said national security adviser Jake Sullivan had spoken Thursday with Ukrainian Head of Presidential Administration Andriy Yermak, discussing ""their shared concerns and common approach regarding Russia's military build-up near Ukraine's border."" The White House statement said Sullivan also had ""underscored the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Aggressive moves by Moscow More Russian military units have been sent to the border area in recent days, sources familiar with the intelligence tell CNN. The latest US intelligence assessments place more than 50 so-called ""Battalion Tactical Groups"" deployed on and around the Ukraine border. US and Ukrainian officials have also seen evidence that Russia has begun diverting commercial air and rail systems to support the military effort, though similar air and rail activity was visible in the spring during Russia's last military buildup, which was ultimately pulled back. Russia has been demanding security guarantees from the US and NATO, including a binding pledge that NATO won't expand farther east and will not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance, according to a draft proposal posted online last week by Russia's Foreign Ministry. The senior administration official told reporters on Thursday that ""we don't plan to negotiate in public"" and declined to say which aspects of Russia's proposals were open to negotiation. ""I expect we will have our substantive response in those talks"" in January, the official said. ""We have not responded substantively to the proposals that have been made other than to say ... clearly there are some things that have been proposed that we will never agree to, and I think the Russians probably know that on some level. We think there are other areas where we may be able to explore what's possible.""

He has blamed the current tensions in Europe on NATO's expansion following the fall of the Soviet Union and said Russia has been forced to respond. Putin also discussed the situation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, the Kremlin said in a statement. According to a readout published by the Kremlin, Putin reiterated his demands to Scholz. ""Vladimir Putin informed [Olaf Scholz] about Russian proposals for long-term, legally binding security guarantees, excluding any further NATO advance to the east, as well as the deployment of offensive weapon systems in countries adjacent to Russia,"" the statement said. Earlier on Tuesday, Putin said his demands towards NATO did not amount to ""an ultimatum."" ""Is this an ultimatum or not? Of course not,"" he told security officials during a meeting at the Russian Ministry of Defence. ""We are hoping for constructive and meaningful negotiations with a visible end result within a specified time frame, which would ensure equal security for all.""

However, US President Biden has consistently signaled that the US will not make any concessions on either NATO or Ukraine's future. Similarly, Stoltenberg Tuesday warned Russia that ""the age of spheres of influence is over"" and stressed that Ukraine remains NATO's partner.

More Russian military units have been sent to the border area in recent days, sources familiar with the intelligence tell CNN. US and Ukrainian officials have also seen evidence that Russia has begun diverting commercial air and rail systems to support the military effort, though similar air and rail activity was visible in the spring during Russia's last military buildup that was ultimately pulled back. The latest US intelligence assessments place more than 50 so-called ""Battalion Tactical Groups"" deployed on and around the Ukraine border with six more in transit on the way. These groups, which can typically include as many as 900 personnel each, are highly diversified and fairly self-sufficient combat units with a combination of troops, artillery, anti-tank weapons, reconnaissance and engineering units. BTGs, as they're known, played a leading role in Russian military activity in Ukraine in 2014. The Biden administration still sees a window to deter a Russian invasion, assessing that Putin has not yet decided whether to launch an attack. But a White House official emphasized to CNN that ""we believe talks would be more productive were they to happen in an environment of de-escalation, instead of escalation."" Russia has been demanding security guarantees from the US and NATO, including a binding pledge that NATO won't expand further east and will not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance, according to a draft proposal posted online Friday by Russia's foreign ministry.

But despite an offer to facilitate a meeting with Russia and NATO to discuss Moscow's concerns, Biden has signaled that the US will not make any concessions on either NATO or Ukraine's future. ""One nation can't force another nation to change its border; one nation cannot tell another to change its politics; and nations can't tell others who they can work with,"" Biden told Putin during their meeting, according to a senior White House official. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg echoed that sentiment in a press conference on Thursday. ""We believe that dialogue is important especially when times are difficult as they are now,"" he said. ""And our invitation to Moscow to meet in the NATO-Russia Council stands, and we are ready to sit down.

Recent satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies and provided to CNN show that Russia has massed troops and equipment as close as 30 miles away from Ukraine's border. The images show an increase between September 7 and December 5 in the number of Russian military vehicles in the southwestern Russian city of Soloti. Russia appeared to be setting up a new regiment within its 3rd Motor Rifle Division, an infantry division of Russia's ground forces, according to Michael Kofman, the research program director in the Russia Studies Program at CNA. ""The 3rd division is still being set up, as is the 144th,"" Kofman said. But he noted that the main source of Russia's buildup can be seen more in the movements by Russia's 6th army, the 1st in Voronezh, the 41st in Yelnya, and the 58th and 49th armies in Crimea. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who just returned from Ukraine, told reporters earlier this week that the next step to watch in the evolution of the Russian presence near the Ukrainian border is if they call up reserve forces. Russia continues to deny that it is putting the pieces in place for an invasion. But Putin has said that Russia has the right to ""defend its security"" in the face of a potential eastward push by NATO. The Biden administration is still weighing whether to send more weapons and equipment to Ukrainians, following shipments in the last two months of Javelin anti-tank missiles and Command Launch Units, Island Class Patrol Boats, first aid kits, secure radios, electronics, medical equipment, engines, generators, spare parts, as well as small arms and ammunition. Ukrainian officials have also been pushing for air defense systems, like Patriot surface-to-air missiles, from the US, according to people familiar with their requests. But National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has conveyed the US' concerns that such shipments might be viewed by Russia as highly provocative, at a moment when the US, Europe and NATO are trying to get Moscow to de-escalate. Still, the White House has not ruled anything out completely, apart from putting US troops on the ground in Ukraine. ""As we pursue diplomatic channels, we will also prepare for all contingencies,"" Sullivan told reporters earlier this month. ""Just as we have been doing for weeks now, including through the preparation of specific responses to Russian escalation should they be required -- specific, robust, clear responses should they be required.""",29,2.1094799089562852,1.8544410314961242,0.2550388774601611,2

Reznikov urged US President Joe Biden -- who was set to speak with Vladimir Putin of Russia in a video conference call on Tuesday -- to stand firm against Moscow. ""If I can advise President Biden, I would like him to articulate to Mr. Putin that no red lines from the Kremlin side should be here. The red line is here in Ukraine and the civilized world will react without hesitation,"" Reznikov told CNN in an exclusive interview Monday. ""The idea of not provoking Russia will not work,"" he added. US and Western officials have expressed concern over the buildup of Russian forces on the Ukrainian border, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying last week that the US ""must prepare for all contingencies."" Russia has capabilities in place along the Ukraine border to carry out a swift and immediate invasion, including erecting supply lines such as medical units and fuel that could sustain a drawn-out conflict, should Moscow choose to invade, two sources familiar with American intelligence assessments told CNN last week. Reznikov told CNN that Ukraine assesses that Russia currently has 95,000 troops within striking distance of Ukraine. He also added that, due to the strength of battle-hardened Ukrainian forces, current US estimates that Russia could assemble 175,000 troops to invade Ukraine were an underestimate. ""So, we have 250,000 official ... members of our army. Plus, I said 400,000 veterans and 200,000 reservists. 175,000 (is) not enough to go to Ukraine,"" said Reznikov. Reznikov stressed that a Russian invasion -- if it happens -- would have ""disastrous"" consequences for the whole of European continent, with an estimated 4 to 5 million Ukrainians possibly needing to seek refuge in Europe. Reznikov also underlined that Ukraine is a major food supplier to Europe and Africa, supplies which he said would be disrupted. The minister said that the Ukrainian army has sent a request for further military equipment aid from its allies, including material support and training for its air force and navy. ""We don't need troops, because I think it's not so fair that American soldiers will die in Ukraine. No, we don't need it,"" added Reznikov. Ukraine has warned for weeks that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion, with NATO pointing out that Russian movements near the border have been unusual. Western powers have repeatedly urged Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. On the Kremlin's motives, Reznikov told CNN he believed the Russia's saber-rattling was aimed at spreading fear and unrest in Ukraine, and at preventing Ukraine from moving closer toward NATO and EU membership. The Kremlin is demanding a legal commitment that NATO will not be expanded eastwards to include Ukraine and that NATO military infrastructure, like missile systems, will not be built up in the country. ""If we share or spread panic in our country and inside of our society, it will be the gift to the Kremlin, because they trying to do that. Because this gathering of their troops alongside of our border, it's a main goal of them to make destabilization process inside of our country, to stop us in our way.

2021-12-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/03/europe/ukraine-russia-2021-tensions-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html,Tensions are high on Ukraine's border with Russia. Here's what you need to know,"Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with a Russian troop build-up near the two nations' borders spurring fears that Moscow could launch an invasion. Ukraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. The picture is complicated -- but here's a breakdown of what we know. What's the situation on the border? The United States and NATO have described the movements and concentrations of troops in and around Ukraine as ""unusual."" As many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine ""as soon as early 2022."" Speaking alongside his Ukrainian counterpart on January 19, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had ""ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine's border, which it could double on relatively short order."" In late 2021, satellite photos revealed Russian hardware -- including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles -- on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300 km) from the border. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest intelligence assessment says Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops near Ukraine, including air and naval forces, transferred more Iskander operational-tactical missiles to the border, and increased its intelligence activity against the country. The assessment came after three rounds of diplomatic talks between Russia and the West aimed at de-escalating the crisis failed to produce a resolution. US officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two. Many of Russia's military bases are to the west of the vast country -- the direction from which history suggests any threats are most likely to come. Russia's Defense Ministry said on December 1 that it had started ""regular"" winter military drills in its southern region, parts of which border Ukraine. The exercises involve more than 10,000 troops, the ministry said. Meanwhile, Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia, an area known as Donbas, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian forces are also present in the area, referred to by Ukraine as ""temporarily occupied territories,"" although Russia denies it. The front lines of the conflict have barely moved in five years, but there are frequent small-scale clashes and sniper attacks. Russia was angered when Ukrainian forces deployed a Turkish-made combat drone for the first time in October to strike a position held by the pro-Russian separatists. Russia also has forces numbering in the tens of thousands at its massive naval base in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014. The Crimean peninsula, which lies to the south of the rest of Ukraine, is now connected by a road bridge to mainland Russia. What's the history of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia? Tensions between Ukraine and Russia, both former Soviet states, escalated in late 2013 over a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. After the pro-Russian then-President, Viktor Yanukovych, suspended the talks -- reportedly under pressure from Moscow -- weeks of protests in Kiev erupted into violence. Then, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, an autonomous peninsula in southern Ukraine with strong Russian loyalties, on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian-speaking citizens. First, thousands of Russian-speaking troops, dubbed ""little green men"" and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the Crimean peninsula. Within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate. Shortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence from Kiev, prompting months of heavy fighting. Despite Kiev and Moscow signing a peace deal in Minsk in 2015, brokered by France and Germany, there have been repeated ceasefire violations. According to UN figures, there have been more than 3,000 conflict-related civilian deaths in eastern Ukraine since March 2014. The European Union and US have imposed a series of measures in response to Russia's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including economic sanctions targeting individuals, entities and specific sectors of the Russian economy. The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of stirring up tensions in the country's east and of violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement. What's Russia's view? The Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans on invading Ukraine, insisting Russia does not pose a threat to anyone and that the country moving troops across its own territory should not be cause for alarm. Moscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO -- in terms of weaponry, training and personnel -- as a threat to its own security. It has also accused Ukraine of boosting its own troop numbers in preparation for an attempt to retake the Donbas region, an allegation Ukraine has denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia's borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances. Putin has also said that NATO deploying sophisticated weapons in Ukraine, such as missile systems, would be crossing a ""red line"" for Russia, amid concern in Moscow that Ukraine is being increasingly armed by NATO powers. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in November that weapons and military advisers were already being supplied to Ukraine by the US and other NATO member states. ""And all this, of course, leads to a further aggravation of the situation on the border line,"" he said. If the US and its NATO allies do not change course in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that Moscow has the ""right to choose ways to ensure its legitimate security interests."" What is Ukraine's view? Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kiev from building closer ties with NATO if it chooses. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN, in response to Russian calls for NATO to halt its eastward expansion. ""Any Russian proposals to discuss with NATO or the US any so-called guarantees that the Alliance would not expand to the East are illegitimate,"" it added. Ukraine insists Russia is seeking to destabilize the country with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, recently saying a coup plot, involving Ukrainians and Russians, had been uncovered. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that a planned coup could be part of Russia's plan ahead of a military invasion. ""External military pressure goes hand in hand with domestic destabilization of the country,"" he said. Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kiev believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. At the same time, Zelensky's government faces challenges on many fronts. The government's popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy. Many people are also unhappy that the government hasn't yet delivered on benefits it promised and ended the conflict in the country's east. Anti-government protests have taken place in Kiev. What does NATO say? NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said ""there will be a high price to pay for Russia"" if it once again invades Ukraine, a NATO partner. ""We have a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions,"" said Stoltenberg, in a December 1 interview with CNN. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO increased its defenses ""with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia ... but also in the Black Sea region,"" Stoltenberg said. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and therefore doesn't have the same security guarantees as NATO members. But Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that it cannot pursue NATO membership. NATO was set to hold crunch talks with Russia on January 12 in Geneva, following discussions with diplomats from Ukraine and the US, in an attempt to avert an invasion. Stoltenberg said on January 10 that Moscow still had ""tens of thousands of combat ready troops"" close the border with Ukraine, but welcomed the Kremlin's willingness to meet. What does the United States say? President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a January 2022 phone call that the US and its allies ""will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine."" The two spoke just a few days after Biden urged Putin to ease the crisis on the border, and before Russian and US officials are set to meet in person in Geneva later this month. Two defense officials told CNN on January 3 that the Defense Department has developed military options for Biden if he decides to increase capabilities in eastern Europe to further deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine. Both officials emphasized that this part of routine planning the military does and that for now, the focus remains on diplomacy and potential economic sanctions. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov held meetings in Geneva on January 10, as the US sought to de-escalate the threat of a Russian advance. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also warned Russia that ""any renewed aggression can trigger serious consequences."" The US delivered roughly $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine in 2021, the Pentagon said, including a package of small arms and ammunition in December. The Biden administration has also weighed sending military advisers and new equipment, including more substantial weaponry, to Ukraine to prepare for a possible invasion, sources familiar with the deliberations told CNN in November. The Obama administration was taken by surprise when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.

The new details about the Russian buildup underscore US officials' heightened alarm over the movements. The current levels of equipment stationed in the area could supply front-line forces for seven to 10 days and other support units for as long as a month, according to one source familiar with the matter. Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN that he believes Russia is positioned to invade ""when they want,"" adding that ""Russia's capabilities would be equivalent to a modern-day blitzkrieg."" A senior administration official told CNN that the US has ""seen additional Russia troops added to the border region in recent days,"" but the source declined to detail how many troops. It is still unclear whether Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to invade or whether the buildup is a game of brinkmanship to get concessions from the West, officials said. But the apparent military readiness has raised alarms among Western officials, who say Russia is positioning itself to be able to launch an attack on very short notice. ""We don't know whether President Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know that he is putting in place the capacity to do so on short order should he so decide,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Latvia on Wednesday. ""We must prepare for all contingencies."" A senior Western intelligence official similarly said Russia is trying to ""set the stage to be ready to conduct a fairly large-scale operation"" into Ukraine in an effort to coerce Kiev away from its drift into the Western European and NATO orbit. Russia has denied in recent days that it has any plans to attack Ukraine but has also demanded security guarantees from the West, such as a pledge that it won't allow Ukraine to join NATO. ""So if NATO still refuses to discuss this theme or the guarantees or ideas put forward by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, of course we will take measures to ensure that our security, our sovereignty and our territorial integrity does not depend on anyone else,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday. The US is still deliberating what kind of military aide to send to Ukraine in the face of the Russian buildup. Ukraine will commission new military patrol boats, supplied by the US, in the coming days to bolster its missions in the Black Sea, according to two people familiar with the matter. The US is planning to send more anti-tank weapons like Javelin missiles, but has for now backed off of providing Ukraine with surface-to-air missiles, like Stingers, which Russia would view as provocative, sources said. The US and its allies in Europe and NATO have warned Russia of severe economic sanctions should it move to invade Ukraine. But Western officials are reluctant to get drawn into a direct military conflict with Russia, which Moscow understands, the senior Western intelligence official said. ""If you threaten force, and you keep your force in the field, and the interventions from the West, politically and militarily, are mild or nonexistent, that emboldens you,"" that official said. ""Generally speaking, I think the aim here is to make clear, 'I'm willing to take this big risk and use force and I'm betting that you are unwilling to engage with me and have a loss of life.' "" Western officials have been pushing for a diplomatic solution they hope will de-escalate tensions -- specifically, the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, a ceasefire protocol signed by Ukraine and Russia in 2015. ""It takes two to tango, and if ... our Russian friends are prepared to implement their commitments under Minsk and our Ukrainian friends are as well, we will fully support that, and that is the best way to avert a renewed crisis in Ukraine,"" Blinken said on Thursday. Critics have characterized the Minsk agreements as disproportionately advantageous to Moscow. But the US has been pushing Kiev and Moscow to implement their terms, including constitutional changes by Ukraine that would give autonomy to the separatist-run eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk. The city has been a major battleground between Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces for more than seven years, and some Biden administration officials believe that if Ukraine were to act first on Minsk, then the onus would be on Russia to de-escalate. But Ukrainian officials have pushed back on such a request, arguing that the Minsk agreements do not require such constitutional changes, people familiar with the discussions said. Russia also has yet to implement several of the Minsk provisions, including a ceasefire, withdrawal of all heavy weapons from the line of contact in eastern Ukraine and an all-for-all political prisoner exchange, as Blinken outlined on Thursday. ""And just as we've been clear with Moscow, we're also urging Ukraine to continue to exercise restraint,"" Blinken said. ""Because again, the Russian playbook is to claim provocation for something that they were planning to do all along.""",29,2.1911624310301647,1.4949306867812595,0.6962317442489052,2

He has said direct communication with Putin is the best way to avoid conflict between the two countries. 'Deep concerns' The last publicly announced phone call between Biden and Putin came in July, about a month after their in-person summit in Geneva. Blinken and Lavrov met on the sidelines of the OSCE summit. Their 30-minute conversation did not yield a concrete path forward, but both sides agreed to continue diplomatic conversations, a senior US State Department official told reporters traveling with the top US diplomat. Blinken also held a bilateral meeting earlier Thursday with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, at which the top US diplomat reiterated Washington's ""unwavering commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and its independence."" In remarks to the press after meeting with Lavrov, Blinken said he had ""made very clear our deep concerns and our resolve to hold Russia responsible for his actions, including to work with European allies to impose severe costs and consequences on Russia, if it takes further aggressive action against Ukraine."" The meeting comes a day after Blinken issued the most forceful US warning yet to Russia about any attempt to destabilize or invade Ukraine. Blinken had warned that there will be ""severe consequences"" for any Russian military action in Ukraine and that the US would ""respond resolutely, including with a range of high impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past."" Blinken did not lay out the ""serious consequences"" he has threatened if Russia invades Ukraine, according to the senior US State Department official. The official, who described Blinken's meeting with Lavrov as sober and professional, said the meeting resulted in an agreement to continue diplomatic conversations and that the US was able to make clear their concerns about the Russian military buildup. According to the State Department, Blinken ""addressed Russia's aggression towards Ukraine, including its military movements near Ukraine's borders"" and ""reiterated the United States' call for Russia to pull back its forces and return to a peacetime posture"" and to adhere to the 2015 Minsk agreements -- an effort to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine -- and a ceasefire in the Donbas region. The Minsk Protocol was written by Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE with France and Germany mediating. On Thursday, Blinken said he told Lavrov that the US was ready to get involved and had already offered to do so with Ukraine's top diplomat. ""And as with Foreign Minister Kuleba, I also made clear The United States is prepared to work with both parties to support a diplomatic resolution through implementation of Minsk agreements in any way that we can,"" he said. Combat troops Pentagon spokesman Ned Price said in his readout that Blinken ""underscored that the best path forward is diplomacy in conjunction with the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, a process the United States is willing and ready to support."" The US and NATO say Russia is increasing the number of combat troops near its border with Ukraine, while the Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans to invade Ukraine and sees NATO support for the country as a threat on Russia's western border. In his own remarks to the press after meeting with Blinken, Lavrov stressed that although Russia does ""not want any conflicts"" with NATO over Ukraine, it maintains the ""right to choose ways to ensure its legitimate security interests."" ""And let's not forget, of course, the proclaimed principle of indivisibility and security, including in the OSCE, in the NATO Council of Russia, which says that no one has the right to strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others,"" he said, also adding that ""the further advance of NATO to the East will definitely affect the fundamental interests"" of Russia's security. The United States, meanwhile, warned again that there would be ""serious consequences"" if Russia engages to ""pursue confrontation"" with Ukraine. On Thursday, Blinken told summit attendees that the US holds ""deep concerns about Russia's plans for renewed aggression against Ukraine."" This aggression would ""move us in exactly the opposite direction,"" Blinken said, stressing ""it's simply not in anyone's interest."" He added that ""the best way to avert the crisis is through diplomacy,"" calling on Russia to abide by the Minsk peace agreements. The interpretation of Minsk and other core OSCE documents emerged as a sticking point between the two countries, with Lavrov saying it ""is clear"" that the US and Russia interpret them in ""different ways."" Blinken criticized Russia's adherence to the Helsinki Final Act, a multilateral agreement dating back to 1975. That non-binding diplomatic accord recognized the inviolability of national borders created after World War II and the importance of noninterference in a nation's internal affairs, but Russia also saw it as implicitly recognizing its hegemony in Eastern Europe. Blinken said Russia ""continues to violate the Helsinki principles and repeatedly obstructs the work of this organization."" Despite the accusations, the two officials recognized the importance of dialogue, with Lavrov acknowledging ""the importance of our two states for global stability and for security, including in the Euro-Atlantic area."" During their private meeting, other subjects like Iran and the Nagorno-Karabakh region were also raised, but there was no discussion of the Russia-backed coup alleged by Ukraine's president. Price said Blinken raised the cases of two Americans detained in Russia -- Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed -- ""and underscored the priority we attach to their prompt release."" ""The Secretary and the Foreign Minister noted the importance of continued coordination on issues in the bilateral relationship and where interests are aligned, including when it comes to blocking Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon,"" he said. The OSCE summit comes on the heels of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Latvia that was dominated by concerns over recent events in Belarus and Russia's intentions in Ukraine. Speaking Wednesday after the meeting in Latvia, Blinken said the US and its NATO partners were prepared to impose costs for further Russian aggression against Ukraine and were preparing for ""all contingencies"" as Russia continues to make troubling moves. While Blinken hasn't detail what those penalties will be, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a Wednesday interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto that the alliance has ""a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions."" Putin called Wednesday for specific agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards and deployment of its weaponry close to Russia's borders. On Tuesday, the Russian President said NATO military expansion close to Russian borders and any deployment of missile systems in Ukraine would be crossing a ""red line.""",29,1.0764128747959791,0.5932861766245612,0.48312669817141796,26
2021-12-01,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/01/politics/antony-blinken-russia-sergei-lavrov/index.html,Blinken warns Russia of 'severe consequences' if it invades Ukraine ahead of Lavrov meeting,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Russia to stand down on its efforts to destabilize Ukraine and said there would be ""severe consequences"" for any Russian military action. ""We don't know whether President Putin has made the decision to invade"" Ukraine, Blinken said in remarks at the end of a North Atlantic Treaty Alliance meeting in Latvia. ""We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide. So despite uncertainty about intention, and timing, we must prepare for all contingencies while working to see to it that Russia reverses course."" Blinken spoke just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a speech that the ""threat"" at Russia's western border is growing. In his own remarks, Blinken noted that the world has already seen Moscow significantly increase troops along the border and deploy misinformation to suggest Ukraine is the aggressor. ""We've seen this playbook before in 2014 when Russia last invaded Ukraine, then as now they significantly increased combat forces near the border,"" Blinken said. ""Then as now, they intensified disinformation that Ukraine is the aggressor to justified pre-planned military action."" The top US diplomat again warned that such an action would be met with ""severe consequences."" ""We've made it clear to the Kremlin that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past,"" he said, adding that the NATO alliance is also ""prepared to impose severe costs for further Russian aggression in Ukraine"" and ""prepared to reinforce its defenses on the eastern flank."" Asked whether the US was considering going as far as cutting Russia off from the global financial system, Blinken declined to elaborate but said the US and allies would make sure Moscow knows. ""I'm not going to spell out today, the specifics, we will probably in time, share that with Moscow so that they can understand fully what's at risk, what the consequences would be if they commit further aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken said. ""And at the same time, we will work through all the details with our partners and allies."" 'A bad joke' NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto that the alliance has ""a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions."" Blinken's remarks, his most forceful on the issue to date, come as he is set to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday in Stockholm, according to a State Department official. Blinken will also meet with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on the margins of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Ministerial Council meeting, the official said. Blinken and Stoltenberg spoke just hours after Putin announced he would seek talks with NATO to get assurances the alliance will not expand eastwards into Ukraine or deploy weaponry close to Russian borders. The day before, Putin said NATO military expansion close to Russia's borders and any deployment of missile systems in Ukraine would be crossing a ""red line."" Asked about Putin's remarks, Blinken said they would be ""a bad joke if things weren't so serious."" Referring to NATO, Blinken said that ""as a defensive alliance, we're not a threat to Russia. We don't have aggressive intent toward Russia. Every step that we take is designed to make sure that we have in place protective, defensive measures to protect the members of the alliance as well as to help our partners have in place the defensive needs, so that they can properly defend themselves against aggression,"" Blinken said. ""That is the purpose of the Alliance."" ""The idea that Ukraine represents a threat to Russia, or for that matter that NATO represents a threat to Russia, it is profoundly wrong and misguided,"" Blinken added. Stoltenberg noted to CNN that after the first time Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO increased its defenses ""with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia ... but also in the Black Sea region."" Asked if he was saying that military options would be on the table if Russia invaded Ukraine, Stoltenberg clarified that Ukraine is not a NATO member, and therefore does not have the same security guarantees as NATO members, who have a commitment to come to each other's defense if one member is attacked. But Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that they cannot pursue NATO membership. ""Ukraine will become a member of NATO when the 30 allies agree that Ukraine meets the NATO standards,"" said Stoltenberg. ""But that's for the 30 allies to decide, not for Russia to decide."" Blinken emphasized the fluidity of the situation in his remarks after the NATO meeting. 'Prepare for all contingencies' Referring to Russia's efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor in order to justify military action, Blinken noted that ""we've seen that tactic again in just the past 24 hours. And in recent weeks, we've also observed a massive spike -- more than tenfold -- in social media activity pushing anti-Ukrainian propaganda approaching levels last seen in the lead up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014."" ""Despite uncertainty about intentions and timing, we must prepare for all contingencies while working to see to it that Russia reverses course,"" Blinken said. ""The United States has been engaging intensively with allies and partners on this issue, and directly with President Putin."" Blinken noted that CIA Director Bill Burns had traveled to Moscow at President Joe Biden's direction to convey to Russian leadership ""our concerns, our commitment to a diplomatic process and the severe consequences should Russia follow the path of confrontation and military action.""

2021-11-16,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/16/world/space-junk-russia-anti-satellite-missile-test-scn-intl/index.html,Space junk is a massive problem. Russia's anti-satellite missile test just made it worse,"Days after world powers wrapped up a monumental climate summit in Glasgow, another environmental emergency was unfolding -- this time in space. On Monday, Russia fired a missile at one of its own satellites as a test, generating thousands of pieces of debris that sent crew members on the International Space Station scrambling for cover. The anti-satellite test was condemned by US officials -- and much of the scientific community -- as a ""reckless and dangerous act"" that could pose a threat to space activities for years to come. The missile test created more than 1,500 pieces of trackable debris, according to US Space Command. The fragments are a hazard to the current seven-person crew on the International Space Station -- which includes two Russians -- and to other satellites that provide crucial communication services back on Earth. But the newly-created space junk also adds to the more than 9,600 tons of debris orbiting our planet, according to the European Space Agency. More than six decades after the Soviets launched the first satellite, Sputnik 1, the junkyard in our skies is growing. Experts warn that much like the climate crisis facing Earth, space is also feeling the impact of human activity. ""You can look at the build-up of plastic in Earth's oceans, and the build-up of junk in orbit around the Earth as being very similar,"" said Hugh Lewis, professor of engineering and physical sciences at the UK's University of Southampton. ""The Earth environment and the space environment -- is just one environment,"" he said, adding that while some governments are working on improving space sustainability, there is still a lot of diplomatic work required. Space junk was not on the negotiating table at the COP26 climate summit. Junkyard in the sky Invisible in the night sky, there are hundreds of millions of debris objects orbiting our planet. This debris is composed of parts of old satellites as well as entire defunct satellites and rocket bodies. According to a January report by NASA, at least 26,000 of the pieces of space junk orbiting the Earth are the size of a softball or larger -- big enough to wreck a satellite; more than 500,000 pieces of debris are marble-sized -- capable of damaging spacecraft, while ""over 100 million pieces are the size of a grain of salt that could puncture a spacesuit."" As these fragments knock into each other, they can create yet more pieces of smaller orbital debris. ""The smaller the fragment, typically the faster it will decay out of the environment,"" said Lewis. The debris created from Russia's missile test ranges in altitude from 440 kilometers to 520 kilometers, according to space tracking service LeoLabs. Debris at roughly this altitude is a ""concern but in many senses a blessing,"" said Lewis. He explained that the debris would essentially ""rain down"" and ""burn up"" as it reenters Earth's atmosphere. But Russia's recent missile test will also cause a ""significant increase of obstacle-collision avoidance actions"" to be taken by satellites, said Tim Flohrer, an expert in space debris at the European Space Agency. Flohrer also pointed to the importance of services like telecommunications, weather forecasting and GPS -- all of which rely on satellites. He said that while people may not feel the immediate impact of space junk in their daily lives, society is nonetheless increasingly ""depending on space as an infrastructure for a lot of services on ground."" ""If the amount of space debris increases further and further, it endangers the future use of space by everyone,"" he said. Russia flexes space muscles Why Russia would carry out this test now is ""the billion dollar question,"" said Lewis. ""In the past, nations have conducted these types of tests to demonstrate their technology and the capability -- and also to make a statement that they're able to do that,"" he said. Only a few countries -- the US, Russia, India and China -- have carried out successful anti-satellite weapon tests. This is not the first time Russia has carried out such tests. But Monday's incident drew Western condemnation for potentially endangering the ISS and its crew. The crew had to quickly don their spacesuits and jump into their spacecrafts in case the station was hit by some passing debris, according to Russia's space agency ROSCOSMOS. But in a message posted on Twitter, Roscosmos downplayed the danger. ""The orbit of the object, which forced the crew today to move into spacecraft according to standard procedures, has moved away from the ISS orbit,"" Roscosmos tweeted. ""The station is in the green zone."" The incident comes at a time of increased tensions between the US and Russia. US officials have publicly sounded the alarm about Russia's buildup of troops near its border with Ukraine and joined European nations in expressing concern about the migrant crisis on the border with Russia's close ally Belarus.",3,6.94463686928675,6.066037029845931,0.8785998394408194,11
2021-11-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/15/europe/poland-belarus-border-crisis-nato-intl/index.html,EU slaps new sanctions on Belarus as NATO warns Russia over military buildup,"The European Union has said it will slap new sanctions on Belarus targeting ""everyone involved"" in facilitating a migrant crisis on the bloc's eastern frontier, as military moves and accusations continue to test a fragile political order in the region. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday warned Moscow against ""potential aggressive actions"" amid a large concentration of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders, deepening concerns over the potential for a wider geopolitical crisis. ""We have to be clear-eyed, we need to be realistic about the challenges we face. And what we see is a significant, large Russian military build-up,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Brussels. Though he said did not want to speculate about Russia's intentions, he added: ""We see an unusual concentration of troops, and we know that Russia has been willing to use these types of military capabilities before to conduct aggressive actions against Ukraine."" Ukraine is not a member of NATO or the EU. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that Russia's recent movements were reminiscent of its invasion of Crimea in 2014. The words of caution from NATO come days after Russia and Belarus flexed their military might near Poland in joint paratrooper drills. Russia, Belarus' largest political and economic partner, continues to defend Minsk's handling of the border crisis while also denying any involvement in it. On Monday, the EU ramped up pressure on all parties involved in the border crisis. The bloc's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell announced in a news conference in Brussels that EU foreign ministers have agreed to impose new sanctions on ""people, airlines, travel agencies and everyone involved in this illegal push of migrants against our borders."" The full list of people and entities would be ""confirmed in the coming days,"" he added. This will be the fifth round of sanctions slapped on Belarus by the EU following a disputed Presidential election and crackdown on dissidents. Borrell said earlier on Monday that he had spoken to the Belarusian foreign minister over the weekend, telling him ""the situation on the border was completely unacceptable and that humanitarian help was needed."" Thousands of people are stuck in freezing conditions near the Kuźnica-Bruzgi checkpoint, trying to cross into Poland. Polish border guards used loudspeakers on Monday to warn people there that force may be used against them if they don't follow orders. The authorities also deployed a helicopter and a water cannon into the area, although the water cannon has not been used. A column of police vehicles has been seen approaching the border. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia are considering triggering NATO's Article 4 over the crisis. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the Polish Press Agency on Sunday that his government is in talks with Latvia and Lithuania on whether to trigger the article, which calls for consultation when ""the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened."" Katarzyna Zdanowicz, a spokesperson for the Polish Border Guard, told CNN on Monday morning that around 4,000 people were camped out along the border and that the situation was ""very tense and very dangerous."" Zdanowicz said there had been ""forced mass attempts to cross the border"" in the Kuznica area by a group of 60 people on Sunday night. Those who tried to cross behaved ""aggressively,"" according to the border guard service. They threw stones and branches at Polish border police, she said, adding that weapons were being ""pointed towards our servicemen"" and a ""flare gun"" was fired towards them. More people were heading to the area on Monday. A CNN team witnessed thousands of people in the Bruzgi migrant camp in Belarus pick up their bags and start moving towards the Polish border on Monday morning. A rumor started circulating in the camp that the Polish government might open the border and allow a humanitarian corridor through to Germany. Poland has adamantly denied this and people amassed in the area have received text messages from Polish authorities saying the information was a ""total lie and nonsense."" The SMS message, also received by members of the CNN team in the area, reads in part: ""Poland won't let migrants pass to Germany. It will protect its border. Don't get fooled, don't try to take any action."" Belarus' State Border Committee said the people moving towards the border have ""purely peaceful intentions,"" according to Belarus state media BelTA. ""The refugees gathered warm clothes, tents, sleeping bags, hoping for a positive outcome of the situation. By noon, they self-organized into a large column and began to move towards the Bruzgi checkpoint,"" Anton Bychkovsky, the official representative of the border committee, was quoted as saying.",29,4.843578378272176,3.259486289206211,1.5840920890659653,0
2021-11-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/15/politics/russia-anti-satellite-weapon-test-scn/index.html,US says it 'won't tolerate' Russia's 'reckless and dangerous' anti-satellite missile test,"The US strongly condemned a Russian anti-satellite test on Monday that forced crew members on the International Space Station to scramble into their spacecraft for safety, calling it ""a reckless and dangerous act"" and saying that it ""won't tolerate"" behavior that puts international interests at risk. US Space Command said Russia tested a direct-ascent anti-satellite, or DA-ASAT missile, striking a Russian satellite and creating a debris field in low-Earth orbit of more than 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris that is also likely to generate hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris. US officials emphasized the long-term dangers and potential global economic fallout from the Russian test, which has created hazards for satellites that provide people around the world with phone and broadband service, weather forecasting, GPS systems which underpin aspects of the financial system, including bank machines, as well in-flight entertainment and satellite radio and television. ""Russia has demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the security, safety, stability, and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations,"" said US Space Command commander Gen. James Dickinson. ""The debris created by Russia's DA-ASAT will continue to pose a threat to activities in outer space for years to come, putting satellites and space missions at risk, as well as forcing more collision avoidance maneuvers. Space activities underpin our way of life and this kind of behavior is simply irresponsible."" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement that he was ""outraged by this irresponsible and destabilizing action. With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts. Their actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station."" Scramble in space The crew on board the ISS had to quickly don their spacesuits and jump into their spacecrafts in case the station was hit by some passing debris, according to Russia's space agency ROSCOSMOS. Two US officials told CNN the precautionary measures were a direct result of the debris cloud caused by the Russian test. There are currently seven astronauts on the space station, including NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov as well as the newly arrived Crew 3 mission team, NASA astronauts Raja Chari, Thomas Marshburn, Kayla Barron and European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer. NASA said the ""crew was awakened and directed to close the hatches to radial modules on the station,"" while hatches between the US and Russian segments remained open. ""An additional precautionary measure of sheltering the crew was executed for two passes through or near the vicinity of the debris cloud,"" NASA's statement said. ""The crew members made their way into their spacecraft shortly before 2 a.m. EST and remained there until about 4 a.m. The space station is passing through or near the cloud every 90 minutes, but the need to shelter for only the second and third passes of the event was based on a risk assessment made by the debris office and ballistics specialists at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston."" On Monday morning, Shkaplerov tweeted, ""Friends, everything is regular with us! We continue to work according to the program."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the condemnations from Nelson and Dickinson in a statement Monday. ""The long-lived debris created by this dangerous and irresponsible test will now threaten satellites and other space objects that are vital to all nations' security, economic, and scientific interests for decades to come,"" Blinken said. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the test ""will significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, as well as to other human spaceflight activities,"" adding that ""Russia's claims of opposing the weapons and weaponization of space are disingenuous and hypocritical."" Only a handful of successful anti-satellite weapon tests have been carried out by the US, Russia, China and India. 'Irresponsible' Price said the US would consult with allies and partners on a response. ""I don't want to get to get ahead of specific measures that we may pursue, that our partners and allies may pursue, but we are going to continue to make very clear that we won't tolerate this kind of activity,"" Price said at Monday's State Department briefing, adding that the US wanted ""to make very clear why this is so dangerous, why this is so, such irresponsible conduct on the part of a nation state."" Price said the US had spoken to senior Russian officials several times to warn them about the danger of such a test but would not say whether there had been a formal diplomatic communication to Moscow. When asked about reports that the ISS crew had to seek shelter, Price referred reporters to Russia and stressed that both American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts were affected. The space station continues to be at risk of impact from objects too small to be tracked as it orbits 220 nautical miles above the Earth. These tiny objects could be pieces of rock, micrometeorites, dust particles or even flecks of paint that chip off of satellites. Space Command said it is examining the new wave of debris. ""We are actively working to characterize the debris field and will continue to ensure all space-faring nations have the information necessary to maneuver satellites if impacted,"" a Space Command spokesperson said. ""We are also in the process of working with the interagency, including the State Department and NASA, concerning these reports and will provide an update in the near future."" 'A hazard' Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters at a Monday press briefing that the ""most immediate concern is the debris itself, which is now floating out there, and could become a hazard, including to the International Space Station."" Kirby said the Pentagon is watching ""closely the kinds of capabilities that Russia seems to want to develop."" ""We watch closely the kinds of capabilities that Russia seems to want to develop which could pose a threat not just to our national security interest, but the security interests of other space-faring nations,"" Kirby said. ""And again, we've been very clear, we would like to see norms for space, so that it can be used responsibly by all space-faring nations."" The incident comes at a time of increased tensions between the US and Russia. US officials have publicly sounded the alarm about Russia's buildup of troops near its border with Ukraine and joined European nations in expressing concern about the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, which European officials have described as a man-made crisis that Belarus has created with Russian backing as an act of ""hybrid war"" against Europe.

People cough and choke but they keep burning the sticks of wet wood: it's the only way to warm up as temperatures start to fall sharply. This coming week, the mercury will dip close to zero degrees Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) at night; rain is also forecast. Winter is coming and they are stuck out in the open, caught up in a geopolitical storm that shows no sign of abating. There are 200 children and 600 women among an estimated 2,000 people massed along the Bruzgi-Kuznica border crossing separating Belarus from Poland, Belarusian border officials told CNN on Friday. Some of those are only babies or toddlers. The migrants -- most of whom are from the Middle East and Asia -- are seeking to cross illegally into Poland, and from there into other European countries, particularly Germany, in search of a better life. A lucky few have small tents; others have made rough shelters from the boughs and branches of the coniferous trees around them. Behind them is the forest; in front the razor wire fence erected by Poland to keep them out, patrolled by Polish police, border guards and soldiers. Some have been waiting weeks now to try to cross the border and there's a sense of brewing anger and frustration in the air. Some migrants have already died in the cold; hypothermia is a real risk. Twenty-eight-year-old mother Shoxan Bapir Hussain said she had embarked on the journey from Iraqi Kurdistan with her husband and four-year-old son, Azhi Ali Xder, because the boy needs surgery for a back condition. Azhi, who has splints on his legs, can't walk, she said. Asked why Azhi didn't have the surgery in Kurdistan, his mother replied: ""Because not very good and maybe the operation fail ... the doctor told me the operation in Germany is very good."" The CNN crew, which was escorted to the straggling camp by the Belarusian authorities on Friday and Saturday, saw minimal infrastructure to support the thousands of people gathered there, with only two small water tanks and no toilet facilities visible. The Belarusian Red Cross is delivering food and water but migrants who spoke to CNN said the deliveries were insufficient and uncertain. There's barely enough to keep those already here alive -- and Belarusian state border officials estimated the number of people in the border region would increase to 5,000 within a week. As desperate people scrambled to get firewood, logs to sit on and other supplies from trucks bringing aid, armed Belarusian forces tried to push them back. Those crowding around one such truck delivering water were made to kneel down on the cold ground before some were allowed through to pick up bottles. ""I'm hungry, I'm hungry,"" said a young girl in English. Parents Ahmed and Ala, with their 15-year-old daughter Reza, told CNN they had traveled from Iraqi Kurdistan in search of a better life in Europe. They had been there for seven nights, they said, and still hold hope they will make it to Europe. Another man, who gave his name only as Binar, said he had paid $2,000 to make the journey from Iraqi Kurdistan. ""Our people want to go to Germany,"" he said. Western leaders have accused Belarus of manufacturing a migrant crisis on the European Union's eastern frontier as retribution for sanctions over human rights abuses. President Alexander Lukashenko's government has repeatedly denied such claims, instead blaming the West for the crossings and accusing it of poor treatment of migrants. Russia, Belarus' largest political and economic partner, continues to defend Minsk's handling of the border crisis while also denying any involvement in it. President Vladimir Putin said in an interview aired Sunday by TV channel Russia-1 that Russia was ""ready to help in every possible way if, of course, something will depend on us here,"" state news agency TASS reported. Putin also placed responsibility for the crisis at the EU's door, accusing it of creating the conditions causing the influx of migrants. ""And now they are looking for someone to blame, in order to absolve themselves of responsibility for the events that are taking place,"" he said, according to TASS. Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski on Saturday called the worsening situation ""an attack on the entire European Union using an artificially created migration crisis."" Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell spoke by telephone on Sunday, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said. ""Vladimir Makei informed his interlocutor about the steps taken by Belarus to reduce the flow of migrants from Asia, Africa and the Middle East,"" as well as the provision of humanitarian assistance, the ministry statement said. Borrell told French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche that on Monday EU foreign ministers would extend sanctions on Belarus to include airlines and travel agencies thought to involved in bringing migrants to the Belarus-Poland border. Sanctions could also be imposed on some 30 Belarusian officials believed to be involved in the crisis, he told the newspaper. Poland: Forces 'on standby' Meanwhile, the authorities in Belarus insist they are doing what they can to support those stuck in the border region. ""The situation in the refugee camp on the Belarusian-Polish border remains difficult, nevertheless, the Belarusian side is doing everything to provide people and especially children with all they need,"" the Belarusian State Border Committee said in a statement Saturday. ""All measures are being taken to provide assistance to refugees. The frontier service ensures the necessary order and protection of the state border."" Poland has barred journalists and international observers from entering the border region, making it difficult to assess the situation on the Polish side of the fence. But there is no sign yet of tensions easing. The Polish Border Guard claimed on Sunday that dozens of migrants with the help of Belarusian security forces were preparing a ""major attempt to break through"" the Polish border. ""Some of the tents are starting to disappear. Foreigners get instructions, equipment and gas from Belarusian services. You can see that Belarusian side is getting ready today for a big attempt at crossing the border. Our forces are ready for action,"" the border guard tweeted. Polish authorities also reported seeing more groups of armed Belarusian officers and a growing commotion among migrants. Belarus state TV, ATN, reported that a group of about 100 or more refugees was on its way to the migrant camp. The Polish Ministry of National Defense tweeted earlier Sunday that its forces in the Kuznica border area had been placed ""on standby."" Late Saturday, Poland sent a mass SMS message to phones in the region to warn that rumors that the Polish border was not well guarded or that migrants would be allowed to pass through to Germany were a ""total lie and nonsense."" Another SMS message read, in part: ""The Polish border is sealed. BLR authorities told you lies. Go back to Minsk!"" The messages include a link to a Polish government website with a more extensive and blunt message, warning that any effort to storm the border could lead to ""dangerous developments."" The show of force unfolding across the region is continuing to test a fragile political order, with allegations from the United States on Russia's military buildup deepening concerns over the potential for a wider geopolitical crisis. On Sunday, US State Department spokesman Ned Price framed the migrant crisis as a designed ""to distract"" from Russia's actions. ""The actions by the Lukashenka regime threaten security, sow division, and aim to distract from Russia's activities on the border with Ukraine,"" Price said in a readout of a weekend call between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau. Neighboring Ukraine is also scaling up security, announcing Thursday that it would hold military drills with some 8,500 servicemen and 15 helicopters in an area near its borders with Poland and Belarus to counter a possible migrant crisis. As long as the international standoff continues, those trapped between the Polish security forces in front of them and the Belarusian security forces behind will have little but hope and smoldering fires to keep them going.",29,3.159034515532755,0.7052520612551236,2.453782454277631,0
2021-11-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/12/europe/poland-belarus-russia-ukraine-military-drills-sanctions-intl/index.html,Russia and Belarus hold military drills as migrant crisis on EU border grows,"Russia and Belarus flexed their military might for a third time this week near the Poland-Belarus border, where thousands of people are stranded in deplorable conditions, trapped at the center of an intensifying humanitarian and geopolitical crisis. On Friday, Russia and Belarus held joint paratrooper drills near Poland, exercises the Belarusian defense ministry said were ""in connection with the buildup of military activity near the state border of the Republic of Belarus."" Two Russian paratroopers died during the maneuvers after their parachutes failed due to strong wind, state news agency TASS reported, citing Russia's defense ministry. Some 15,000 Polish soldiers have been deployed to Poland's border with Belarus in recent days in reaction to a tense standoff that the European Union, the United States and NATO say is of Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko's making. NATO said Friday it was monitoring for any escalation or provocation in the situation on its members' borders with Belarus after the drills. Western leaders, including prime ministers of neighboring Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, are accusing the Lukashenko regime of manufacturing a migrant crisis on the EU's eastern frontier as retribution for sanctions over human rights abuses. Lukashenko's government has repeatedly denied such claims, instead blaming the West for the crossings and treatment of migrants. Trapped in the crossfire are upwards of 2,000 people stuck between Poland and Belarus who are now facing conditions the United Nations has called ""catastrophic,"" with desperate scenes of hunger and hypothermia playing out in freezing forests and at makeshift camps at the border. Russia, Belarus' largest (and most important) political and economic partner, continues to defend Minsk's handling of the border crisis while also denying any involvement in it. Russia demonstrated that support by flying two long-range Russian Tupolev Tu-22M3 supersonic long-range bombers over Belarusian airspace on Wednesday and on Thursday. The aircraft, known to have nuclear capabilities, practiced ""issues of interaction with ground control points"" with armed forces of both countries, the Russian defense ministry said. Neighboring Ukraine is also scaling up security. On Thursday, it announced it would hold military drills with some 8,500 servicemen and 15 helicopters in an area near its borders with Poland and Belarus to counter a potential migrant crisis. The show of force unfolding across the region is continuing to test a fragile political order, with allegations from the United States on Russia's military buildup this week deepening concerns over the potential for a wider geopolitical crisis. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the US is ""concerned by reports of unusual Russian military activity"" and mentioned the possibility that Russia may be ""attempting to rehash"" its 2014 invasion of Ukraine. Russia hit back at the allegations on Friday, saying that they represented an ""empty, groundless escalation of tensions."" 'This will not succeed' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the border crisis a ""challenge to the whole of the European Union"" earlier this week. ""This is not a migration crisis. This is the attempt of an authoritarian regime to try to destabilize its democratic neighbors. This will not succeed,"" she said. Western powers are now preparing to levy new sanctions on Belarus, and the EU said it was considering penalties against third-country airlines for contributing to the crisis by transporting people to Minsk, the Belarusian capital. On Friday, Turkey's foreign ministry said in a tweet that they would ban people from Syria, Iraq and Yemen -- where many of the migrants stuck at the border are from -- from flying from Turkish airports to Belarus. The ministry on Thursday fought back against claims it was contributing to the crisis, saying that they ""refuse to be portrayed as part of a problem which Turkey is not a party to."" EU Council President Charles Michel replied to the tweet, saying ""thank you"" for the ""support and cooperation."" Moscow hasn't budged however, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissing accusations that the Russian carrier Aeroflot had helped refugees travel into Belarus. Statements from Aeroflot demonstrate that it ""did not provide and is not providing transportation of migrants to Minsk,"" Peskov said, adding that ""even if some airlines are engaged in this, it in no way contradicts any international regulations."" In the US, the White House's National Security Council announced on Wednesday that it was preparing ""follow-up sanctions"" designed to hold Belarus accountable for ""ongoing attacks on democracy, human rights and international norms."" This is the second round of sanctions announced by the US in recent months. It is not clear when the new measures will be executed. The EU is also expected to ""expand and tighten its sanctions against Lukashenko's regime,"" Germany's acting Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Thursday. The human cost Meanwhile, conditions for migrants trapped at the border continue to deteriorate, with people at a makeshift migrant camp at Bruzgi, on the Belarusian border, now starving and desperate for firewood in near freezing temperatures. CNN gained exclusive access into the camp, where chaotic scenes at a food distribution area were unfolding as the Belarusian Red Cross tried to hand out food aid to tightly packed crowds while Belarusian security forces pushed them back. Disappointment and grief is palpable throughout the camp. Migrants fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria and Iraq had come to Belarus with the expressed purpose of moving deeper into Europe and of trying to find a better life. But now, there's a bitter sense of disappointment that isn't happening. Since the beginning of November, there have been 4,500 recorded border crossing attempts, according to Polish authorities. The Polish border guard said it had recorded around 1,000 crossing attempts in the last few days, including some ""large-scale"" efforts with groups of more than 100 people trying to breach the fence. Humanitarian groups are accusing Poland's ruling party of violating the international right to asylum by pushing people back into Belarus instead of accepting their applications for protection. Under article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution in other countries. Poland says its actions are legal. As the standoff continues, people keep on coming. Belarusian authorities estimate that the number of migrant arrivals to the border could swell to 10,000 in the upcoming weeks if the situation isn't resolved.",29,0.7074743054681992,0.16735032743409406,0.5401239780341052,0
2021-11-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/11/europe/belarus-poland-crisis-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html,Tensions are rising on the Poland-Belarus border. Here's what you need to know,"Thousands of people have been stranded at the border between Poland and Belarus for months, trapped at the center of an intensifying geopolitical dispute. The migrants -- most of whom are from the Middle East and Asia, and who are hoping to travel on from Poland deeper into Europe -- have been gathering on the Belarusian side of the Kuznica border crossing in terrible conditions. Authorities closed the crossing last week, and later cleared makeshift camps where thousands had gathered. But the ramification of the border crisis will continue to be felt in Europe and beyond, with uncertainty over what comes next. Here's what you need to know about the crisis that's unfolding on Europe's frontier. Migrants are facing dire conditions Charities said people stuck in the border area have battled freezing weather and lacked food and medical attention, with reports of beatings and grueling conditions emerged. Polish police said Monday that around 3,500 people had gathered near the Kuznica crossing. On Friday, Belarusian border officials told CNN that 200 children and 600 women were among an estimated 2,000 people massed near the border crossing. Some of those are only babies or toddlers. One Syrian asylum-seeker, who recently arrived in Poland after his third attempt at crossing the border from Belarus, told CNN that on arriving at the border, guards caught him and three others in his group. He was beaten up, and suffered facial injuries, a broken nose and bruised ribs. Polish authorities said seven migrants have been found dead on Poland's side of the border, with reports of more deaths in Belarus. The makeshift camps where migrants had been been staying on the Bruzgi-Kuźnica crossing were finally cleared by Belarusian authorities on Thursday, with migrants moved to a nearby warehouse that has been converted into an ad hoc processing center. Although the shelter has offered a reprieve from below-zero temperatures and rough living conditions in the short term, Belarus has yet to lay out what comes next for migrants who flew to Minsk in the hope of making it to Europe, and a better life. Many now fear their new accommodation is just a first step in the deportation process. Since the beginning of November, there have been thousands of recorded border crossing attempts, according to Polish authorities. A spokesperson for Poland's border guards told CNN on Monday that there had been ""forced mass attempts to cross the border"" in Kuznica area by a group of people over the weekend and that the situation was ""very tense and very dangerous."" Last week, Polish border guard representatives told CNN that some of the migrants had been pushed toward the barriers by Belarusian services. Speaking on Monday, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Belarus was doing everything to prevent people from accumulating at the border. Polish authorities have detained small numbers of people, allowing only small numbers of people the option of applying for asylum in Poland. Others have been immediately sent back to Belarus. Access to the border area has been tightly restricted. Journalists and aid workers have been blocked from traveling to the area by an exclusion zone. Poland's government is ramping up its nationalist rhetoric Polish President Andrzej Duda visited the border last Thursday in a show of solidarity with the military, police and border guards. Earlier in the day, Duda addressed thousands of Poles who marched through Warsaw to celebrate Independence Day. In a speech with nationalistic references in support of the government's strict policy of keeping the border with Belarus closed to migrants, he said: ""We have always been, we are and we will be part of a Europe based on Christian values, which are also the foundations of our tradition and culture."" ""The time has come when you need to defend your homeland. But we need to guard its borders more than before,"" Duda said, adding: ""It must be done with dedication, with sleepless nights, in coldness, in hardship, in a very ungrateful situation to which we were forced by the hybrid actions of the Belarusian regime against Poland and against the European Union."" Humanitarian groups are accusing Poland's ruling party of violating the international right to asylum by pushing people back into Belarus instead of accepting their applications for protection. Under article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution in other countries. Poland says its actions are legal. A larger political crisis is brewing Lukashenko has been accused of manufacturing the migrant crisis on the border by the prime ministers of neighboring Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, leading Poland to adopt a bill in October for the construction of a wall along its border with Belarus. NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also pointed the finger at Belarus, saying last week that ""Belarus using migrants as a hybrid tactic is unacceptable."" Lukashenko's government has repeatedly denied such claims, instead blaming the West for the crossings and treatment of migrants. Russia, Belarus' largest (and most important) political and economic partner, has defended Minsk's handling of the issue and has denied any involvement in the crisis. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Russia had ""absolutely nothing to do with"" the crisis at the border. Russia underlined its support for the Lukashenko regime by performing joint military exercises over Belarusian airspace last week. On Wednesday, two long-range Russian Tupolev Tu-22M3 supersonic long-range bombers practiced ""issues of interaction with ground control points"" with armed forces of both countries, the Russian Ministry of Defense said. On Thursday, they carried out those flights over Belarus' airspace for a second time. The two nations then held joint paratrooper drills near the Polish border on Friday. Meanwhile, Ukraine is also scaling up security around the border with Belarus. On Thursday, it announced it would hold military drills with some 8,500 servicemen and 15 helicopters in an area near its borders with Poland and Belarus to counter a potential migrant crisis. Speaking to ""Axios on HBO"" last week, Stoltenberg said the alliance was closely monitoring ""unusual"" Russian troop movements near the Ukraine border and would be ready to address what may happen. Following talks in Brussels with Ukraine's foreign minister, Stoltenberg said on Monday: ""We again call on Russia to de-escalate, to reduce tensions and be transparent on their military activities in and around Ukraine."" Stoltenberg has promised NATO's ""support"" to Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. The crisis at the Poland-Belarus border is continuing to test a fragile political order, with allegations from the United States on Russia's military buildup deepening concerns over the potential for a wider geopolitical crisis. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last Wednesday that the US was ""concerned by reports of unusual Russian military activity"" and mentioned the possibility that Russia may be ""attempting to rehash"" its 2014 invasion of Ukraine. Last Friday, Russia said any allegations that it could invade Ukraine were ""empty, groundless escalation of tensions."" Belarus faces new sanctions European leaders have accused Belarus of manufacturing the migrant crisis on the EU border as retribution for sanctions over human rights abuses, a claim the Belarus government has repeatedly denied. In response to the escalation, the United States and the European Union announced new sanctions against Belarus last week. On Monday, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was going to extend sanctions further. ""Today we are going to approve a new package of sanctions against Belarusian people responsible for what's happening ... and we are going to launch a framework in order to implement other sanctions to other people, airlines, travel agencies and everybody involved on this illegal push of migrants in our borders,"" he said. The White House's National Security Council said last week the US was preparing ""follow-up sanctions"" designed to hold Belarusian leaders accountable for ""ongoing attacks on democracy, human rights and international norms."" The spokesperson did not specify when the new sanctions would come into place. ""We are deeply concerned by the Lukashenka regime's inhumane actions and strongly condemn their callous exploitation and coercion of vulnerable people,"" the spokesperson said. This is the second round of sanctions announced by the US in recent months. In August, the White House announced a sweeping executive order targeting those in the Belarusian regime involved in the repression of human rights and democracy. The executive order was released on the one-year anniversary of Belarus' election, which sparked widespread protests throughout the country and which the US -- and much of the international community -- declared fraudulent.",29,0.17669675639492022,6.515990114673702,-6.339293358278782,0
2021-11-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/politics/revil-ransomware-attack-charges/index.html,US seizes $6 million in ransom payments and charges Ukrainian over major cyberattack,"Law enforcement officials seized an estimated $6 million in ransom payments and federal prosecutors charged a suspect from Ukraine over a damaging July ransomware attack on an American company in a breakthrough for the Biden administration's pursuit of cybercriminals, the Justice Department announced Monday. Yaroslav Vasinskyi, a Ukrainian national who was arrested in Poland last month, is accused of deploying ransomware known as REvil, which has been used in hacks that have cost US firms millions of dollars. Vasinskyi conducted a ransomware attack over the Fourth of July weekend on Florida-based software firm Kaseya that infected up to 1,500 businesses around the world, according to an indictment unsealed Monday. Vasinskyi and another alleged REvil operative, Russian national Yevgeniy Polyanin, are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, among other charges. As part of the investigation, authorities seized at least $6 million in funds allegedly linked to ransom payments received by Polyanin, US officials said. CNN was first to report on the law enforcement actions before the Justice Department announcement. The law enforcement bust is one of the most impactful actions yet in the Biden administration's multipronged fight against ransomware, which accelerated after a series of hacks hampered US critical infrastructure firms this year. While some ransomware groups have continued to breach US companies and demand payment, others have gone quiet in recent months. Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference that the US and its allies would do ""everything in our power"" to track down ransomware operatives and claw back the money ""they have stolen from the American people."" Vasinskyi, 22, is being held in Poland pending US extradition proceedings, while Polyanin, 28, remains at large. CyberScoop, first reported that Vasinskyi had been arrested. The Treasury Department on Monday also imposed sanctions on Vasinskyi and Polyanin, as well as cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly has moved money for ransomware operatives. The State Department meanwhile announced a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of the leadership of the REvil ransomware gang. The department is also offering up to $5 million for information leading to an arrest or conviction of anyone conspiring or attempting to participate in REvil ransomware attacks. US officials have pursued diplomacy with the Russian government, sanctioned a cryptocurrency exchange and exhorted companies to raise their cyber defenses. But experts say that putting ransomware operators in handcuffs is a crucial part of the US strategy to curb attacks. Romanian authorities last week arrested two additional alleged REvil operatives, Europol announced Monday. And South Korean authorities last month extradited to the US a Russian man accused of being part of a different crime ring that infected millions of computers worldwide. In a statement later on Monday, President Joe Biden said, ""We are bringing the full strength of the federal government to disrupt malicious cyber activity and actors, bolster resilience at home, address the abuse of virtual currency to launder ransom payments, and leverage international cooperation to disrupt the ransomware ecosystem and address safe harbors for ransomware criminals."" Biden administration has made tackling ransomware groups a priority Biden in June asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to take action against criminal hackers that were holding US companies hostage. But the Russian government has historically been reluctant to pursue cybercriminals on its own soil as long as the hackers refrain from hitting Russian targets. Since the Biden-Putin summit, ""We have not seen a material change in the landscape,"" US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told the Associated Press last week. ""Only time will tell as to what Russia may do on this front."" Garland on Monday declined to comment when asked if the Russian government was aware of or condoned the REvil activity, citing an ongoing investigation. In a crowded landscape of cyber crooks, REvil has stood out for a series of brazen attacks. The group reportedly demanded $50 million from Apple earlier this year after hacking one of the tech giant's suppliers. The FBI has also blamed REvil for a May ransomware attack on JBS USA, which accounts for about a fifth of US beef production. The incident forced JBS to temporarily shut down production at facilities in Australia, Canada and the US. JBS paid the hackers $11 million to unlock their systems. REvil has been deployed on about 175,000 computers worldwide, with at least $200 million paid in ransom, Garland said Monday. Polyanin allegedly conducted about 3,000 ransomware attacks, including some on law enforcement agencies and municipalities throughout Texas, Garland said. REvil has had a volatile few months. The websites the group uses to extract ransoms and shame victims went offline after the Kaseya hack, only to reemerge in September. But the group shut down again last month after a foreign government and Cyber Command, the US military's hacking unit, compromised the group's computer infrastructure, according to a Washington Post report. To turn up the pressure, the State Department last week announced a $10 million reward for key information on the hackers behind the so-called DarkSide ransomware, which forced major US fuel provider Colonial Pipeline to shut down for days in May. Government agencies have leaned heavily on private experts in their pursuit of criminal hackers. Cybersecurity firm Emsisoft, for example, saved victims of a type of ransomware millions of dollars in ransom payments by discovering a flaw in the hackers' code. John Fokker, a former Dutch cybercrime investigator who is now with cybersecurity firm McAfee Enterprise, told CNN that his team had helped law enforcement identify multiple suspects involved in REvil and Gandcrab, another type of ransomware. No single law enforcement action will be a fatal blow to the lucrative, transnational ransomware economy. Victims of ransomware attacks paid about $350 million in ransoms in 2020, according to Chainalysis, a firm that tracks cryptocurrency. But that figure is likely just a fraction of the digital extortion that went on that year. And victims who don't pay the ransom can spend millions of dollars rebuilding their computer infrastructure. FBI Director Christopher Wray told US lawmakers in September that the bureau was investigating more than 100 different types of ransomware.",3,5.613285140215976,6.097482183426268,-0.4841970432102922,18
2021-11-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/politics/bill-burns-cia-putin-moscow/index.html,CIA Director had rare conversation with Putin while in Moscow last week,"CIA Director Bill Burns held a rare conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week, to convey ""serious"" US concerns about Russia's military buildup along the Ukrainian border and to attempt to determine Russian intentions, two sources with direct knowledge told CNN. Putin's spokesperson also confirmed there was a discussion. ""Yes, such a conversation took place via telephone,"" Putin's spokesperson Dimitry Peskov told CNN on Monday CNN reported Friday that Burns' visit to the Russian capital took place at a time of growing concern among some US officials about the possibility of an expanded Russian military intervention in Ukraine. One source told CNN that the US has ""serious concerns"" about the Russian build-up, adding, ""It would be foolish for us not to be considering the possibility of an invasion or incursion."" When asked about the topics touched upon during this phone conversation, Peskov said they were ""Bilateral relations, the crisis situation in the diplomatic practice, and an exchange of views on regional conflicts."" ""Of course, cybersecurity issues were also mentioned,"" Peskov added. Assessments on Russia's motives differ widely within the administration, with some sources telling CNN they believe Russia could be preparing for an invasion, while others suggest they are conducting an exercise, or simply trying to intimidate Ukraine. And publicly, Ukraine has downplayed the idea that Russia is building up its military presence near the border beyond normal levels. Russia has ""established a practice of ""transferring and accumulating military units for the purpose of maintaining tension in the region and political pressure on neighboring countries,"" Ukraine's Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies last week demonstrate the kind of irregular Russian troop and equipment movements that US officials are worried about. The images show Russian troops, tanks and artillery massing near the Russian town of Yelnya, and the Biden administration is more concerned than it was in the spring that Russia could launch an invasion, two senior US officials said. President Joe Biden dispatched Burns to Moscow on Tuesday in an effort to prevent any kind of escalation, where he met with Kremlin officials to try to deter any plans for an offensive by conveying that the US is closely monitoring the troop movements, according to people briefed on their meeting. Burns also mentioned US concerns that Russia is close to using its gas exports as leverage, with Ukraine and other European nations are forecast to suffer energy crises heading into winter.

2021-11-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/04/europe/russia-ukraine-military-buildup-intl-cmd/index.html,Satellite photos raise concerns of Russian military build-up near Ukraine,"Once more, tensions are rising in Ukraine. Reports that the Russians are moving military hardware some 250 kilometers from the border have raised eyebrows in Washington. And Ukrainian forces have deployed combat drones along the battle lines that separate them from pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region. The front lines of the conflict -- a standoff stretching hundreds of miles from northern Ukraine to the Sea of Azov -- have barely moved in five years. On Monday, US Defense Department spokesman Admiral John Kirby said the Pentagon was ""aware of public reports of unusual Russian military activity near Ukraine."" Satellite imagery has shown Russian hardware -- including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles -- on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300km) from the border. But Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Monday it had recorded no ""additional transfer of Russian units, weapons and military equipment to the state border of Ukraine."" On Tuesday, the Defense Ministry said an estimated 90,000 Russian troops were located ""near the border and in the temporarily occupied territories"" as well as in the Black Sea. Ukraine's Defense Ministry added that Russia had established a practice of ""transferring and accumulating military units for the purpose of maintaining tension in the region and political pressure on neighboring countries."" Kirby said the US was watching closely: ""I can't speak for Russian intentions, but we are certainly monitoring the region closely, as we always do. Any escalatory or aggressive actions would be of great concern to the United Sates."" On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""The movement of our military equipment or army units across the territory of the Russian Federation is exclusively our business. ""Russia has never threatened anyone, is not threatening, and does not pose a danger to anyone,"" he insisted. Observers say Russia's actions are worth keeping a close eye on. ""At the moment it is a developing situation. It's not 'nothing happening' and it doesn't mean that there will be an offensive op tomorrow,"" says Michael Kofman, a fellow at the Wilson Center who researches Russia's military. 'Provocation' claims We've been here before -- several times -- since the separatists, with Russian backing, entered eastern Ukraine in 2014. Heightened tensions have, in the past, come to nought. Russian units gathered near the border last spring -- setting off alarm bells in western capitals -- but eventually returned to base. But hopes that the frozen conflict might be defused through negotiations sponsored by European governments and the US are moribund. Russia has responded swiftly to Ukraine's use of Turkish-made combat drones for the first time in the conflict. One of those drones struck a separatist position last week. ""We observe attempts to carry out provocations, elicit some reaction from the militia and drag Russia into some kind of combat action,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian state television Monday. Popular Russian TV host Vladimir Soloviev went further, saying Ukraine was provoking the separatist-held ""Republics"" into taking ""retaliatory measures, which means a major war. Under these circumstances, Moscow will be confronted with a serious choice."" Russian rhetoric towards Ukraine has hardened in recent months. Both President Vladimir Putin and his predecessor, Dmitri Medvedev, have penned essays describing Ukraine as a vassal of the West -- even going so far as to suggest it is not a real country. In a long article in July, Putin said ""the formation of an ethnically pure Ukrainian state, aggressive towards Russia, is comparable in its consequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against us."" ""True sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia,"" he wrote. Pivot from east to west Moscow's strategy is aimed at deterring Ukraine's flirtation with closer ties to NATO and the European Union, a pivot from east to west that would stoke historic Russian fears of encirclement. Those fears deepened when the former Soviet Baltic states joined NATO, along with several ex-members of the Warsaw Pact, such as Romania and Poland. Just last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reiterated US support for Ukraine's ""reorientation,"" pledging ""continued US support for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity and Euro-Atlantic aspirations."" Ukraine joining NATO would be an ""extremely dangerous"" move that would trigger retaliatory measures from Russia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko retorted. Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Peskov condemned what he said were ""aggressive expansionist tendencies, especially on the part of NATO and other countries,"" adding that ""Russia has always taken measures to ensure its security and will continue to do so."" The US, which already supplies Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, also promised to support Ukrainian forces through security assistance, including efforts to enhance the country's maritime capacity. US warships regularly patrol the Black Sea -- much to Russia's ire. Russia's latest weapon in the conflict is not camo-painted. Instead, it comes through a pipeline. The Nord Stream 2 (NS2) gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany is near completion, and that worries Ukraine -- which has been a transit route for Russian gas through its extensive network of pipelines. ""Putin is telling everyone to their face: 'You allow NS2 to become operational or you won't get any more gas,'"" according to Yuriy Vitrenko, chief executive of Ukraine's Naftogaz. Vitrenko told the Financial Times that ""[If] there will be no physical transit going through Ukraine, it increases the chances of a full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine."" The White House said at the weekend that US President Joe Biden had spoken with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about efforts ""to ensure that Russia cannot manipulate natural gas flows for harmful political purposes."" As yet, there are no signs that all the adversarial language is translating into a higher level of hostilities along what's known as ""the line of contact,"" but Russian calculations are never easy to gauge.",29,1.610781370352719,3.5053112614366646,-1.8945298910839456,2
2021-11-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/02/politics/cia-director-russia-trip/index.html,CIA Director Burns met with Russian security council chief in Moscow,"CIA Director Bill Burns is leading a delegation of senior US officials in Moscow for a two-day series of meetings with Russian officials, a US embassy spokesperson said on Tuesday. ""They are meeting with members of the Russian government to discuss a range of issues in the bilateral relationship,"" the spokesman said, but did not offer details. Among those meetings, Burns met with the head of Russia's national security council, Nikolai Patrushev. A terse statement from Russia's powerful Security Council said that the two sides discussed ""Russian-American relations."" The meeting was not previously announced and the CIA, which as a matter of policy does not discuss the director's schedule, declined to comment. The rare -- but not unheard of -- meetings between the head of the CIA and senior Russian security officials comes amid persistent tensions between the Washington and Moscow. The Biden administration has imposed sanctions on Russia related to election interference, the poisoning of dissident critic Alexi Navalny, and cyberattacks on US interests. Officials have been warily watching recent Russian troop movements on the border of Ukraine. Russia also remains under sanctions for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Still, the US does see opportunities for cooperation with Russia, in particular on arms control, and the intelligence community under past administrations has sought points of mutual interest with Moscow. ""We periodically meet with our Russian intelligence counterparts for the same reason our predecessors did — to keep Americans safe,"" former President Trump's first CIA director, Mike Pompeo, wrote in a letter defending a meeting with top Russian intelligence officials in Washington in 2018. That meeting garnered attention primarily because it took place on American soil with officials who were under US sanction. Burns, a veteran diplomat, has deep experience in Russia. He served as the US ambassador there from 2005 to 2008. The Biden administration has maintained ongoing ""open, direct and candid dialogue"" with Russia on the issue of cyberattacks, Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technologies, said at a Washington think tank event last week. Biden has put pressure on Putin to crack down on a spate of damaging ransomware attacks on US organizations -- including critical infrastructure -- emanating out of Russia and announced the beginning of US-Russia cybersecurity talks at the end of a summit meeting with Putin in Switzerland in June. The US government has ""shared information with Russia regarding criminal ransomware activity being conducted from its territory,"" a senior administration official told reporters last month, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules that the White House set for the call. It's not clear that the talks have yielded any substantive results, however. Nobelium, the Russian hacking group responsible for the SolarWinds hack, has compromised as many as 14 technology firms since May as part of another apparent espionage campaign, Microsoft said last week.",3,3.4168617199284235,1.664777141062578,1.7520845788658455,2
2021-10-28,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/28/politics/russian-extradited-south-korea-ohio/index.html,Russian accused of being part of cybercrime ring extradited from South Korea to Ohio,"A Russian man accused of being part of cybercrime ring that infected millions of computers worldwide was arraigned in federal court in Ohio on Thursday after being extradited from South Korea, the Justice Department announced. US prosecutors allege that 38-year-old Vladimir Dunaev was part of a transnational criminal group that since 2015 has tried to steal millions of dollars from victims in the US and elsewhere. The group allegedly used a piece of malicious software known as Trickbot and other tools to steal money and confidential data from businesses in multiple countries including the US, United Kingdom, Russia and India. The hackers also targeted the computer networks of hospitals, schools, public utilities and governments, according to prosecutors. Dunaev is charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft, and multiple counts of wire and bank fraud, among other charges, the Justice Department said. He faces up to 60 years in prison if convicted on all counts. Dunaev entered a not guilty plea in his initial court appearance Thursday and waved detention, according to Daniel Ball, a spokesman for the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. An attorney for Dunaev could not be immediately reached for comment. The arrest is a notable win for the US Justice Department, which is typically forced to wait until accused Russian cybercriminals leave Russia to pursue them because Washington and Moscow do not have an extradition treaty. It comes as the Biden administration has tried to pressure the Russian government to crack down on cybercrime amid continued ransomware attacks against US companies. In a press release that did not mention Dunaev by name, the South Korean Ministry of Justice said it had extradited a Russian national accused of being involved in the Trickbot malware to the United States on October 20. The ministry said the Russian national was arrested in June at South Korea's Incheon International Airport. Another person allegedly involved with Trickbot, a Latvian national known as Alla Witte, was arrested in Miami in February and is also being prosecuted in the Northern District of Ohio. Prosecutors accused Witte of writing computer ""code related to the control, deployment, and payments of ransomware."" Witte pleaded not guilty in June, according to Ball, the Northern District of Ohio spokesman. Dunaev also allegedly used his technical skills in support of Trickbot. According to prosecutors, he helped the malware avoid being detected by security software. The extradition of Dunaev follows the FBI and European law enforcement agencies' arrest last month of two people in Ukraine who have allegedly made multimillion-dollar ransom demands following hacks of US organizations. The Justice Department's pursuit of foreign cybercriminals is meant as a complement to diplomatic pressure that US officials are putting on Moscow to address the issue. Despite a June meeting between Biden and Putin on the topic, ransomware attacks on US companies have continued. Earlier this month a ransomware incident interrupted programming at Sinclair Broadcast Group, the second largest operator of TV stations in the US. A hacking tool used to encrypt Sinclair's networks is similar to malicious code previously used by a Russian crime group sanctioned by the US government, analysts told CNN. Trickbot has had a key role in some ransomware attacks on US companies; hackers have used the malicious software to access victim networks and then deploy ransomware to lock up their computers. The FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in October 2020 warned that Trickbot was being used in a wave of ransomware attacks on US health care organizations. Concerned by the potential threat of ransomware to election infrastructure in 2020, Microsoft and other tech companies last year knocked some computer servers used by Trickbot offline. While some of the people allegedly involved in Trickbot have been apprehended, the malicious code itself is alive and well. Researchers with IBM reported this month some of the developers of Trickbot had begun working with two additional criminal groups to distribute malicious code to targeted organizations. The Biden administration has also sought to expand international coordination in prosecuting ransomware groups and curtailing their sources of revenue. The White House this month convened a 30-country virtual meeting to that end. Andres Sutt, a senior Estonian government official who attended the meeting, told CNN that governments need to invest a greater proportion of their IT budgets in cybersecurity to effectively defend against ransomware. ""If we look at the intensity of [ransomware] attacks, the sophistication, the impacts, I think it's only clear that we need to respond in being more cyber resilient,"" said Sutt, who is Estonia's minister of entrepreneurship and information technology.",3,1.832351436608478,7.2098464644569695,-5.377495027848491,18
2021-10-18,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/18/europe/russia-suspends-nato-mission-intl/index.html,Russia suspending mission to NATO in response to staff expulsions,"Russia is suspending its permanent mission to NATO in response to the alliance's expulsion of eight Russians, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Monday. Lavrov said the Kremlin's move -- which could come into effect as early as November 1 -- was a result of ""NATO's actions."" Russia is also suspending the activities of the NATO military liaison mission in Moscow, Lavrov said, with staff accreditation to be withdrawn on November 1. The NATO information bureau in Moscow, which was established at the Belgian embassy to explain the role of NATO and NATO policies to the Russian public, will also be terminated, he said. ""NATO is not interested in any equal dialogue or in any joint work,"" Lavrov said. ""If so, then we do not see much need to continue to pretend that some change is possible in the foreseeable future. NATO has already in fact declared the impossibility of such changes."" Earlier this month, NATO expelled eight members of the Russian mission to the alliance who they determined were ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" according to a NATO official. The Kremlin's moves on Monday come as the United States steps up its support to Russia's neighbors, which a senior US defense official this weekend said were ""on the frontlines of Russian aggression."" At the time of the expulsion of the Russian officers, Moscow reacted by saying NATO's actions were inconsistent with the alliance's previous comments and undermined a chance for reconciliation. ""NATO leaders spoke about the importance of de-escalation in relations with Russia, called for resuming dialogue within the Russia-NATO Council, sending an ambassador to Brussels,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said earlier this month, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti. ""If anyone believed in the sincerity of these statements, today there are none left."" On Monday, NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said the alliance had ""taken note"" of Lavrov's comments, but that NATO hadn't received any official communication about the matter. Heightened tensions As Russia announced its retaliatory measures on Monday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was meeting Georgia's prime minister and his counterpart in Tbilisi. The two nations signed a new initiative to help Georgia ""become more efficient and more effective and NATO interoperable,"" the DOD said in a statement. The program is an extension of the long-running Georgia Defense Readiness Program, ""aimed to help Georgia defend its sovereign territory"" after Russia invaded South Ossetia and Abkhazia in 2008. The two provinces make up 20 percent of Georgia's landmass and are still occupied by Russia, according to the DOD. Austin's visit to Georgia is the first stop on a three-part tour ""to reassure allies and partners of America's commitment to their sovereignty in the face of Russian aggression,"" according to a US Department of Defense statement. Austin will also visit Ukraine and Romania before a visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels. Previous spats between NATO countries and Russia have had wide-ranging global implications. In 2018, in the wake of the poisoning of former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England, NATO trimmed the Russian mission to 20 from 30 positions. The UK attributed the attack to a unit of Russian military intelligence. Days later, 20 nations, including the US, backed Britain by together expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats as part of a coordinated global response. Russia expelled 60 US diplomats and closed the US Consulate in St. Petersburg in retaliation. And in 2014, NATO suspended ""all practical civilian and military cooperation"" with Russia after it annexed Crimea.",29,4.616044592468431,5.272788865882489,-0.6567442734140574,2
2021-10-13,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/13/politics/white-house-ransomware-meeting/index.html,US calls on Russia to do more to crack down on ransomware groups as White House hosts meeting with allies,"The White House called on Russia to do more to crack down on ransomware groups operating from the country but conceded that Moscow has taken ""some steps"" after President Joe Biden urged his Russian counterpart to tackle the groups in the summer. A senior administration official told reporters that the US wants to see ""follow-up actions"" ahead of a 30-country virtual meeting on ransomware that began Wednesday. The US government has ""shared information with Russia regarding criminal ransomware activity being conducted from its territory,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules that the White House set for the call. ""We've seen some steps by the Russian government and are looking to see follow-up actions,"" said the official, who declined to say what those steps and actions were. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan kicked off the virtual meeting by telling delegates, ""We cannot do this alone."" Sullivan called for more cooperation on ransomware to ""hold criminals and the states that harbor them accountable."" ""Transnational criminals are most often the perpetrators of ransomware crimes, and they often leverage global infrastructure and money laundering networks across multiple countries, multiple jurisdictions to carry out their attacks,"" Sullivan said. A spokesperson for the Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Biden in June urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to crack down on Russian-speaking hackers after a string of ransomware attacks cost US companies millions of dollars. One such incident forced Colonial Pipeline, which provides some 45% of fuel for the East Coast, to shut down operations for days in May. The disruptions have placed cybersecurity, and ransomware in particular, high on the list of national security priorities for the White House. Senior government officials from the US and 30 allied countries are meeting virtually Wednesday and Thursday to forge closer cooperation in the fight against ransomware, which has knocked computers offline at health care centers in multiple countries during the coronavirus pandemic. Australia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom are among the countries represented at the meetings, according to the White House. The discussions are focusing on efforts to prosecute and disrupt ransomware groups and on dealing with the role of cryptocurrency in funding ransomware attacks, among other issues. Russia is conspicuously absent from the meetings as the White House tries to make progress in bilateral talks with Moscow. Since the Biden-Putin meeting, US officials have watched closely for changes in behavior from the Russian government and for any change in the pace of cybercriminal operations emanating from Russia. Mandiant, a US cybersecurity firm that responds to ransomware incidents, has reported a lull in activity from some ransomware groups. But whether any reduction in ransomware attacks endures remains to be seen. A spokesperson for Recorded Future, another cybersecurity firm, told CNN that the firm has been tracking a ""Russian-based ransomware group that currently has over 100 members"" and is ""actively recruiting new cybercriminals."" Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said last week that she had not seen ""significant, material changes"" in Russian behavior since the tete-a-tete between Biden and Putin. Cybersecurity analysts say one of the most effective ways to combat ransomware is to arrest the people who develop and deploy the computer-locking software. While Russian cooperation has been elusive, the US has leaned heavily on allies in Europe in raids against some criminal groups. The FBI and European enforcement agencies last month arrested two people in Ukraine who allegedly had made multimillion-dollar ransom demands following hacks of European and US organizations. Timo Koster, a former Dutch diplomat focused on cybersecurity, said he expects countries like the US and the Netherlands to encourage other governments to take more assertive actions against cybercriminal groups. ""More international cooperation is needed"" in coordinating how countries attribute cyberattacks to specific actors and on responses from law enforcement and security agencies, Koster told CNN.",3,5.241627198124693,1.518516872662691,3.723110325462002,2
2021-10-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/07/politics/russian-hackers-microsoft-report/index.html,"Russian state-backed hackers having greater success at breaching foreign government targets, Microsoft says","Russian state-backed hackers are having greater success at breaching targets in the United States and elsewhere as they make government organizations the primary focus of their attacks, according to data that Microsoft released Thursday. Government organizations accounted for more than half of the targets for Moscow-linked hacking groups for the year through June 2021, compared to just 3% the previous year, according to Microsoft. At the same time, the success rate of Russian intrusions into government and non-government targets has gone from 21% to 32% year over year, the technology giant said in a report focusing on state-backed and cybercriminal activity. The report comes as the Biden administration has looked to bolster US government defenses against cyber espionage from Russia -- and publicly expose that activity with US allies. The European Union last month blasted alleged Russian hacking and leaking operations that the bloc said were aimed at interfering in democracy. But despite the US and its allies condemning Russian and Chinese behavior in cyberspace, those countries are ""still comfortable leaning into nation-state attacks,"" said Cristin Goodwin, associate general counsel and head of Microsoft's Digital Security Unit. ""And we're seeing that increase."" The data includes the Russian espionage operation that breached at least nine US federal agencies in 2020 by exploiting software made by SolarWinds, a Texas-based firm. CNN reported Wednesday that the same Russian group behind that activity has in recent months continued to try to breach US and European government organizations. The Biden administration in April blamed Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, for that spying campaign. Moscow has denied involvement in the hacking. North Korea, Iran and China were next most active countries Microsoft also reported Thursday that 58% of government-linked hacking attempts originated in Russia, followed by 23% from North Korea, 11% from Iran and 8% from China. The data comes with caveats. A flurry of unsuccessful attempts to guess target organizations' passwords, for example, count as separate hacking attempts. And Microsoft did not report on US intelligence agencies, which also conduct cyber-espionage campaigns. But with over one billion devices using Microsoft software worldwide, the technology provider has a broader view of malicious cyber activity than most other organizations. And the data tells its own story. Cyber activity, for example, often correlates with larger geopolitical dynamics and tensions. While Russia beefed up its troop presences along its border with Ukraine earlier this year, the same hacking group that carried out the SolarWinds breaches has ""heavily target[ed] Ukrainian government interests,"" according to Microsoft. The number of Microsoft customers in Ukraine ""impacted"" by the Russian hacking group soared to 1,200 in the fiscal year ending in June compared to just six the year prior. ""Historically, nation-state attacks tend to follow where a geopolitical priority sits for a country,"" Goodwin told CNN. Google on Thursday announced that APT28, a Russian hacking group that interfered in the 2016 election, had sent some 14,000 malicious emails to Gmail users around the world in late September. The phishing was aimed at government personnel, journalists and defense firms, among others, according to Google. US organizations were among those targeted. Shane Huntley, director of the Google Threat Analysis Group, said that all of the emails had been classified as spam and blocked by Gmail. Much of public attention on alleged Russian cyber operations in the last year has been on the group that bugged SolarWinds software. But there's an array of hacking teams at Moscow's disposal that carry out different missions against valuable targets in the US and allied countries, analysts say. Some of those groups specialize in infiltrating critical infrastructure firms, both to collect information and, perhaps in some cases, to have a foothold into networks in the event of a conflict, according to some US officials and private sector experts. Attacks on critical infrastructure ""The concern is that effort that we've seen [Russian groups] actively use disruptive effects around the globe,"" Rob Joyce, head of the National Security Agency's Cybersecurity Directorate, said at the Aspen Cyber Summit last week. ""And we've seen evidence of prepositioning against US critical infrastructure. So, all things that can't be tolerated and we need to work against."" One such group, known as Berserk Bear in the cybersecurity industry, has been linked to breaches of industrial software at US electric utilities that the Department of Homeland Security blamed on Russian government hackers in 2018. The group, which some analysts have linked to Russia's FSB intelligence agency, has in the last three years shown a steady appetite for collecting data held by critical infrastructure firms in the US, Ukraine and Western Europe. That includes breaches, in 2019 and 2020 respectively, of the websites of one Ukraine's largest energy firms and San Francisco's International Airport, according to Joe Slowik, a former cybersecurity specialist in the US Navy who now works at security firm Gigamon. Over a decade of operations breaching critical infrastructure firms, Berserk Bear ""has almost certainly facilitated significant intelligence gathering, capability development and potentially effects pre-positioning in highly sensitive networks,"" Slowik said in a paper that will be presented at the Virus Bulletin conference this week.",3,1.662424313306127,2.0559029267843756,-0.39347861347824864,23

The FBI and law enforcement agencies in France and Ukraine coordinated the raid, which led to the seizure of $375,000 in cash and two luxury vehicles, and the freezing of $1.3 million in cryptocurrencies, according to Europol. The arrests are a notable win for US law enforcement, which has tried to step up its pressure on cybercriminals based in Eastern Europe and Russia following a series of ransomware attacks that have cost US companies millions of dollars. Europol described the two suspects as ""prolific,"" having demanded between €5 and €70 million ($5.8 million and $81.3 million) from victims. But a spokesperson for the EU's law enforcement arm declined to identify the two people or what type of ransomware they allegedly used, citing legal reasons and an ongoing investigation. ""The organized crime group is suspected of having committed a string of targeted attacks against very large industrial groups in Europe and North America from April 2020 onwards,"" Europol spokesperson Claire Georges said. Four FBI personnel were in Ukraine to help coordinate the raid, according to the Europol statement. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment. Mark Arena, CEO of cybersecurity firm Intel 471, said he believed the two people arrested were ""affiliates,"" rather than ""core operators,"" of a well-known ransomware service. ""A number of actors use or have used multiple ransomware services, hence we caution against any linking of this action to a single specific ransomware service,"" Arena told CNN. John Fokker, a former cybercrime investigator with the Dutch police, said that it often takes years for law enforcement agencies to ""build a solid case"" against ransomware gangs, which publicly boast about their victims but operate in the shadows. In this case, Europol said investigators held a dozen meetings in preparation for the raid. ""Ukraine has proven to be willing and committed to arrest ransomware criminals within its borders — something which has been a bigger challenge with Russia,"" Fokker, who is now head of cyber investigations at McAfee Enterprise, told CNN. President Joe Biden in June urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to crack down on cybercriminals operating from Russian soil, but US officials have been skeptical of Moscow's willingness to do so.

In an exclusive CNN investigation released Tuesday, three former high-ranking Ukrainian military intelligence officials described how they attempted to lure suspected war criminals out of Russia to face prosecution for acts of violence committed in eastern Ukraine, where separatists backed by Moscow have been fighting for years. The operation failed when the Russians were arrested in Minsk last year. Speaking in Kiev after a closed briefing about the sting, a parliamentarian from Ukrainian President Zelensky's ruling party, Maryana Bezuhla, confirmed to journalists there was a Ukrainian operation to gather intelligence and arrest suspected Russian war criminals. ""There was a special measure as part of the routine work of intelligence officers to collect information about those who participated in aggression...At the initiative of the SBU [Security Service of Ukraine], the next event was opened to try to pull a certain number of people out of the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Bezuhla said. Bezuhla, who heads a parliamentary commission which investigates ""illegal actions"" of officials, said there will be an investigation into how the operation became known to Belarusian special services. CNN's three sources detailed and provided evidence the Russians arrested in Belarus in July 2020 were the target of an elaborate intelligence sting by Ukraine to capture alleged Russian war criminals, with the knowledge and support of the United States, something US officials deny. The findings of CNN's report had a wide-ranging impact in Ukraine. In the Ukrainian parliament Thursday there was a brief scuffle, and rowdy scenes as opposition deputies held up placards accusing government figures of being responsible for the failure of the operation and demanded an immediate investigation into how it failed. One placard read, ""time to name the traitors of Ukraine"" and another placard read, ""we demand truth."" On Wednesday, an adviser to the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mikhail Podoliak, dismissed CNN's report, questioning the use of anonymous sources. ""As usual, mandatory anonymous retirees -- and this is key -- confirm something. Another anonymous source denies something. Once again: anonymous, without a surname, without a position and, therefore, sources that have no informational and reputational value,"" Podoliak said to Ukrainian state media Ukrinform. Podoliak also pointed to a statement from Russia's Federal Security Services (FSB) Wednesday, which said CNN's report offered ""fresh evidence"" that Ukrainian secret services interfere in Moscow's internal affairs. ""When before did the FSB official appear in the media almost instantly to support and praise a report? This is factually a signal for the entire Russian propaganda system, on what to do and how to work. Now they will ""disperse"" this story with reference to CNN,"" Podoliak said. But speaking in the Ukrainian parliament Thursday, one opposition politician, Iryna Herashchenko, of the European Solidarity Party, accused the Presidential office of mishandling the situation by saying ""CNN is spreading lies and deceit, and accusing them of cooperation with FSB."" ""Let me remind you,"" Herashchenko added, ""Zelensky was at the front lines with this same CNN correspondent. Then it turns out that Zelensky took FSB agents to the front line so they can film information about our military there? It doesn't match up,"" she said. CNN's Matthew Chance gained unprecedented access to Zelensky on the front lines in eastern Ukraine earlier this year as Russia massed trips near the border region. Herashchenko, who is herself a former journalist, accused Zelensky's office of censorship of CNN's piece in Ukraine and urged Ukrainian journalists to take note of the story to ""honor"" the Ukrainian military who she said had been betrayed by the failure of the operation.",3,4.287584137969637,1.6306979118471918,2.6568862261224453,3
2021-09-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/07/europe/ukraine-belarus-russia-mercenaries-sting/index.html,"Ukraine spies tried to ensnare alleged Russian war criminals with a fake website, promises of riches and an international sting","Security forces shattered the early morning calm of the lakeside Soviet-era resort outside the Belarusian capital of Minsk, bursting in to arrest 32 Russian mercenaries. It was less than two weeks before Belarus' presidential election last year, and authorities suspected that the outsiders had been sent from Russia to interfere. The men were indeed part of a mission. But the target was not Belarus, and they were not under orders from any Russian entity. They were being set up. The 32, along with one other man detained in southern Belarus, were the target of an elaborate intelligence sting by Ukraine, with the knowledge and alleged support of the United States. Three former high-ranking Ukrainian military intelligence officials described exclusively to CNN how they orchestrated the extraordinary operation aimed at luring suspected war criminals out of Russia to face prosecution for atrocities committed in eastern Ukraine where separatists backed by Moscow have been fighting for years. First, the Ukrainian agents posed as a Russian private military company, recruiting for security jobs that paid above the going rate, offering a lucrative $5,000 a month contract to protect Venezuelan oil facilities, CNN was told by the men, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the sensitive operation. That bait was taken by hundreds of would-be Russian contractors who applied for work, the sources said, giving Ukrainian intelligence an unprecedented opportunity to begin to identify and reel in those suspected of war crimes. ""We started to call them and say, 'Hey, man, OK, tell me something about yourself. Maybe you are not really a fighter, maybe you are a plumber or something like that,'"" one of the former military intelligence officers told CNN of the vetting calls to applicants. ""And then they started to reveal things about themselves, sending us documents, military IDs and proof of where they'd fought. And we are, like, 'bingo, we can use that,'"" the source added. In other words, according to the intelligence officers, the targets themselves started to send in evidence of who they were, their military experience and even the particular battles and incidents in which they had been involved, including IDs, and potentially incriminating photos and videos of their exploits in eastern Ukraine and elsewhere. One video, shared with CNN by the former military intelligence sources, captures a group of rebel fighters in eastern Ukraine holding up the wreckage of a military aircraft that the sources said had just been shot down, a crime designated as terrorism in Ukraine. Other applicants linked themselves to the attack on MH17, the Malaysian Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was shot down in July 2014 over Ukrainian territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists. All 298 people aboard the aircraft died. A Dutch-led team of international prosecutors said the plane was downed by a missile brought in from Russia and fired from a village controlled by separatists. Russia has denied any involvement. ""There were two who were present when the missile that downed MH17 was launched. Four others were members of a group responsible for shooting down our military aircraft and killing at least 70 of our best men,"" a second former Ukrainian military intelligence source told CNN. ""Identifying and punishing these people was of high interest to us,"" he added. It was apparently of interest to US intelligence too, although US officials deny having a direct role. According to the Ukrainian intelligence officials, the Ukrainian-led operation got US cash, technical assistance and advice from the CIA on how to draw the Russian mercenaries in. A senior US official told CNN those claims are ""false."" He indicated US intelligence was aware of the operation but denied any involvement. The official, who requested anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly, suggested efforts to implicate US agencies may be an attempt to share, or even pass, blame for what was a high-risk Ukrainian operation that went wrong. CNN spent weeks in Ukraine, verifying and reviewing accounts of the operation and speaking to the men who were on the inside. Posing as a private military company made sense -- military contractors linked to the Kremlin, have become a well-known aspect of life for Russian veterans. CNN has previously tracked Russian mercenaries operating in Libya, the Central African Republic, Syria and Mozambique among other countries. Often the soldiers-for-hire work for Wagner, a major private military company that's allegedly linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, though Prigozhin denies the connections. The announcement of the arrests at the Minsk resort by Belarusian authorities said the detained men worked for Wagner. With their website recruitment ruse going undetected, Ukrainian intelligence officials simply picked those men with the closest and most controversial links to Ukraine and offered them the fake Venezuela contracts, the sources said. They picked 28 Russians allegedly linked to illegal acts in Ukraine and five more without connections to allay any suspicions, they said. The Russians were told they would be flown to Turkey for a flight connection to Caracas. The real plan was to get them to Ukraine where they could be arrested, the sources told CNN. The coronavirus pandemic threw an unexpected wrench in the plan when Russia closed its borders to stop the spread of Covid-19. Moscow did, however, continue to permit travel to its neighbor and ally Belarus. According to the Ukrainian sources, the unwitting recruits were transported overland to Minsk by bus, from where they thought they would soon depart for Venezuela. But once in Minsk, there was a delay. The recruits were told it would be a few days before they could leave and were moved to the Belorusochka Sanatorium, a discreet Soviet-era health resort set on a tranquil reservoir 15 minutes outside the capital, where, the sources said, it was hoped they could remain undetected. The burly mercenaries at the spa that promises ""comfort and coziness"" amid the ""absence of city fuss and everyday worries"" seemed incongruous if not suspicious, one staffer remembered. ""Yes, I remember, I met them,"" a security guard told CNN last month. ""They spent a couple of days here. They didn't do anything to disturb us,"" he said, adding that the arrests were a surprise. ""People come here because there's a beautiful reservoir on the other side of the sanatorium,"" he said. The delay was long enough for the Belarusian security services to act, just hours before the group was due to fly out, according to CNN's sources. At the time, some suspected Russian involvement. In dramatic scenes, broadcast on Belarusian state TV, the arrested men were paraded on screen, and their identification documents shown as evidence of their Russian military backgrounds. ""We got confirmed intel these Russians had real combat experience, and actually took part in armed conflicts,"" an unnamed, heavily disguised Belarusian police commander revealed on state TV. A former presidential adviser in Belarus told CNN on the condition of anonymity that Belarusian authorities initially did believe the group had been sent to Belarus by the Russians to destabilize the country ahead of upcoming elections. He told CNN there was confusion in Minsk over what seemed to be aggression from their Russian allies. The Kremlin seemed caught off guard too, with its spokesman telling Russian media they ""did not have complete information"" about the incident. The Kremlin later denied they had sent the men to interfere in the internal affairs of Belarus. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky got involved too, calling for the extradition of the men to Ukraine during a telephone conversation with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko just days after the arrests. ""I hope that all suspects in terrorist activities on the territory of Ukraine will be transferred to us for prosecution in accordance with the current international legal documents,"" Zelensky said, according to a readout of the call. A couple of days later, Lukashenko rejected that request. He spoke to Putin and both leaders ""expressed confidence that the situation would be resolved,"" a Kremlin statement said. A week on from that call, Russia announced the return of the 32 Russians arrested at the sanatorium. The 33rd man, who was a dual national of Belarus and Russia, stayed in Belarus. President Zelensky of Ukraine has publicly denied there was a Ukrainian operation, telling Ukrainian TV in June 2021 that his country had been ""dragged into"" the issue. ""I understand that the idea of this operation was the idea of, let's say, other countries, definitely not Ukraine,"" he said. Ukrainian officials did not respond to CNN's request for a comment for this story. But according to CNN's Ukrainian sources, the failure was a serious blow to Ukrainian intelligence who they say had worked on hooking the Russian suspects for close to 18 months. ""If these people would have ended up here in Ukraine, the details of their criminal acts would have become known around the world,"" one of the sources told CNN. ""Ukraine could have brought them to justice and shown that our fight with Russia is serious and that we won't raise our hands in surrender,"" the source added.",13,1.8522065698877224,3.758066439491608,-1.9058598696038855,3
2021-09-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/02/world/russian-space-chief-iss-nasa-roscosmos-scn/index.html,"'Divorce is not possible' with US over space station, says Russian space chief who threatened to pull out","Despite threatening to pull Russia out of the International Space Station prematurely, the head of the country's space agency is now promising to remain NASA's partner at least until the orbiting outpost is eventually retired. ""This is a family, where a divorce within a station is not possible,"" Dmitry Rogozin told CNN in his first interview with western media since becoming Roscosmos' director general. Divorce certainly seemed possible in June when Rogozin made headlines for threatening to withdraw from the station unless US sanctions on Russia's space sector were lifted. Rogozin is also under personal US sanctions for his role as Russia's deputy prime minister of defense during his country's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. ""Either we are working together and then sanctions should be lifted immediately, or we won't work together"" and Russia will deploy its own space station, said Rogozin in June, according to Russian state-owned media TASS. Now Rogozin appears to deny ever making those threats in front of Russia's lower house of parliament. ""I think there is a problem in interpretation. I, most likely, did not say that,"" Rogozin told CNN, speaking Russian. His words were translated by an interpreter hired by CNN. ""It's just that we're talking about how we can continue our comradery, our friendly relations with our American partners, when the US government is implementing the sanctions against the very same organizations which supply the International Space Station."" Another test for the US-Russia space partnership It's a relationship that's being tested politically and in orbit. In July, Russia's newly docked Nauka module accidentally fired its thrusters, spinning the space station out of control. At the time, three NASA astronauts, two Russian cosmonauts, a Japanese astronaut and an astronaut with the European Space Agency were on board. Rogozin admits ""we did have a problem,"" and he blames it on human error. ""The equipment does not break down on its own,"" Rogozin said. ""For 21 years, we have not done anything like this. An older generation, who knew how to dock a complex structure like this, has retired."" The incident has raised questions about Roscosmos' reliability as NASA's top partner on the International Space Station. But now that the 23-ton Nauka -- which adds Russian laboratory space and sleeping quarters -- is there and working, Rogozin says it is ""the guarantee"" that Russia will have the ""technical capacity for station operation up until the time when it will reach the end of its service life."" The US and Russia have been partners in space ever since the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975, when an American Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz capsule, signaling the end of the first space race. ""I think that the cooperation with the Russians, which has been there ever since 1975, will continue,"" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, speaking at the annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs on August 25. The US tried to extend this partnership in space to the moon with NASA's new Artemis program. But so far, Russia has refused to participate. ""For this to happen, we request dignified conditions from NASA. We don't want to be assistants or servants,"" Rogozin said. ""The main condition is equal rights when discussing issues and joint decision making. That's what we have today at the International Space Station."" A relationship with another country too Rogozin insists Russia wants to preserve its partnership in space with the United States. ""We respect our partners in the US,"" Rogozin said. ""We are friends."" But in June, Russia also announced plans to build a base on the moon with the world's newest superpower in space: China. Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, the ranking member on the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, says actions speak louder than words. ""Russia sent a clear signal in creating an alliance with China for lunar exploration rather than continuing its historical partnership by joining the United States,"" said Moran, speaking at the Space Symposium. Pressed if Roscosmos is prepared to potentially throw away this decades-long partnership with NASA, Rogozin was noncommittal. ""We are pleased that you are looking at us as some sort of bride, who is trying to cheat on one groom and pick another one, but this is not the situation as it appears,"" Rogozin said. Rogozin wants Roscosmos to partner in space with both the US and China. ""If we are not able to work with the US -- not because of our fault, and I think this can be changed -- but if this is not taking place, in order to divide the responsibility, risks, money, we need, naturally, another partner,"" Rogozin said. Nelson is planning to meet with Rogozin, likely in Russia, sometime later this year. Asked to respond to Rogozin's comments, Nelson said, ""I look forward to continued cooperation with Roscosmos on the International Space Station until 2030 and into the future."" But Nelson did not address the specific conditions Rogozin is demanding before Russia will sign on to the Artemis program. At the end of a nearly hour-long interview, Rogozin said he had one final ""big request"" for the United States to preserve this decades-long experiment in space diplomacy. ""America is a large country. As a big country, it must be kind and wholehearted. It must propose conditions for its Russian partner, far smaller by the size of its population, and by the size of its economy. If these conditions will be dignified to us, we will accept it. The ball is in NASA's hands, the US' hands now.""",3,3.4288031123056366,7.367019036680963,-3.9382159243753265,11
2021-07-21,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/21/middleeast/syria-torture-russian-mercenaries-cmd-intl/index.html,His brother was tortured and killed by Russian mercenaries. Now this Syrian refugee wants justice,"In the central Syrian desert, an oil field has become a makeshift torture chamber. An unarmed man writhes in the dust, howling in pain. Four men in military fatigues pin him down and smash his hands and feet with a sledgehammer. As he cries out for help, they taunt him in Russian, drowning out his agonized screams with laughter. In the background of the video, which was uploaded online, a nationalist Russian military song, ""I am Russian special forces,"" plays. The victim in this harrowing amateur video is Mohamad, a 31-year-old Syrian construction worker and father of four young children, who disappeared on his way home from a job in neighboring Lebanon in March 2017. Mohamad's final words were those of the Shahada, a declaration of his Muslim faith. The men who killed and decapitated Mohamad scrawled graffiti in Cyrillic on his lifeless chest. It said ""for VDV and reconnaissance,"" a reference to the Russian airborne forces. At least one of the men in the video has been identified by the independent investigative Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta as a mercenary from the shadowy Wagner group -- a private military outfit that has links to the Kremlin-connected oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as ""Putin's chef"" for his ties to the Russian President. The Kremlin denies any connections to Wagner and insists that private military companies are illegal in Russia. Prigozhin has previously denied being connected to Wagner. Neither he nor anyone from his companies would talk to CNN in recent years despite multiple attempts seeking comment, including for this report. ""These people risk their lives and by and large this is also a contribution in fighting terrorism ... but this is not the Russian state, not the Russian army,"" said President Vladimir Putin in 2019. CNN special report: Putin's private army Russian forces have been operating in Syria since 2015, and there is substantial evidence to show that Wagner's presence in the country is connected to the Russian military deployment. Analysts say it's inconceivable that Wagner would exist without Putin's approval. Indeed, its training camp in southern Russia is attached to a Russian special forces base. Four years after Mohamad's murder, three NGOs from Syria, France and Russia filed a landmark legal case against Wagner for the role it allegedly played in the atrocity, as well as the perpetration of possible war crimes by the men seen in the video. The lawsuit was filed in March on behalf of Mohamad's brother, Abdullah. It is the first time anyone has tried to hold a member of Wagner accountable for what rights groups say is a growing list of atrocities committed by the mercenaries, whose expanding global footprint has allowed Moscow to advance an off-the-books foreign policy in places like Syria, Ukraine, Libya, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Mozambique Abdullah, a refugee who fled Syria in 2017, has never spoken publicly about his brother's killing before. He broke his silence in an exclusive interview with CNN, he says, to draw international attention to the tragedy that devastated his family. To protect family members still living in regime-controlled areas of Syria, Abdullah requested that CNN conceal his full identity and the location of the interview. ""My brother is gone, he will never come back,"" Abdullah said. ""I want the world to hear about my brother's case, so these criminals are held accountable."" Final phone calls to family In one of Mohamad's last phone calls, in April 2017, he told Abdullah he had been detained by the regime as he crossed back into Syria, after working in Lebanon for about eight months. He said he had been taken to Damascus and forced to join the military, but that he planned to desert. Ten days later, Mohamad called to say he was being sent to Homs the next day and that he would escape at night. It was his last call to his family. ""He said, 'Give my best to my father and my mother, ask them to forgive me, I am going to do something, I am going to leave, I don't know if I will be able to get back to you or not,'"" Abdullah recalled. He said his brother had asked him to ""take care of my wife,"" adding: ""I am entrusting you with my family."" ""It was that kind of talk, it was as if he knew something was going to happen to him,"" Abdullah explained. Mohamad never met his youngest daughter. With the Syrian civil war raging, and poor internet and phone connections in their remote village, it was hard for Mohamad's family to find out what had happened to him. It wasn't until a video showing his torture emerged online months later that his loved ones discovered the true horror that had befallen him. ""One day a guy from our town sent me a video clip, he said: 'Watch the video, it could be your brother.' Of course, I recognized my brother -- from his clothes, his voice, his appearance,"" Abdullah said, his voice pained. ""He was being tortured by soldiers, they were not Syrian, we did not understand what they were saying."" Abdullah told other family members about what he had seen in the video, but did not share it with them, fearing what it would do to their elderly parents. ""When I saw that first video, I still had hope he was still alive,"" he said. ""He was being tortured, but he was alive, he was moving. We were hoping he was still alive and in a hospital."" Their father traveled to Damascus, searching for his son at hospitals and jails in the Syrian capital. ""About two months later, the second video emerged, that is when we believed our brother died,"" the softly spoken 27-year-old, now visibly distraught, told CNN. ""When I watched the second video [which showed Mohamad being beheaded], I stayed in a room ... I did not leave the room for three days. He was not only my older brother. He was my friend. We were always together,"" Abdullah said. ""My (other) brother developed kind of a psychological illness from the videos."" Landmark legal case Wagner's forces have been used as the tip of the spear in Syria, but their shadowy presence affords Moscow a degree of deniability. In February 2018, a US airstrike killed dozens and injured hundreds of Wagner fighters as they were advancing towards an oilfield outside the border town of Deir Ezzor. Moscow did everything it could to distance itself from the incident, but when bodies of Russian mercenaries started to return home, it became clear it was a Wagner operation. CNN spoke to a source connected to Wagner who had been to visit the injured fighters as they returned to Moscow. Moreover, in the days following the attack, one independent Russian media outlet went to visit the mother of a fighter who died in Syria, she confirmed that her son was not a Russian regular soldier. Russia's foreign ministry would only say that these contractors were working independently and went to Syria on their own. In Syria, the use of mercenaries is based around a company called Evro Polis, which was sanctioned by the US Treasury for being connected to Prigozhin. In February 2018, CNN obtained a copy of a contract between Evro Polis and the Syrian government. The agreement stated that Evro Polis gets to keep 25% of the revenue from the oil fields if they are recaptured from rebel territory. In other words, Wagner does the fighting, Evro Polis keeps the spoils. Since Wagner's footprint has grown across the Middle East and Africa, a key launchpad has become the Russian military base at Latakia on Syria's Mediterranean coast. CNN and other researchers have monitored the frequency of flights originating from Latakia to other theaters across the region. One document obtained by CNN, details the agreement made between Yevgeny Prigozhin and a Russian airforce 223rd flight detachment to use their planes. There is growing evidence to suggest that Mohamad's case may be just the tip of the iceberg. A CNN investigation in June uncovered evidence that Russian mercenaries were committing war crimes and human rights abuses in the Central African Republic (CAR), according to several witnesses and community leaders. The Russian government denied the allegations and insisted the contractors in CAR are ""unarmed and do not take part in hostilities."" The CAR government also denied the allegations but said an inquiry would establish the facts. News of the legal action launched in March -- by the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), and Memorial Human Rights Center in Russia -- coincided with the 10th anniversary of the Syrian uprising. ""The complaint ... is an unprecedented attempt to fill the impunity gap and bring Russian suspects to account,"" the advocacy groups said in a statement. ""Syrian activists and victims of the atrocities perpetrated by all parties to the conflict in Syria have been working tirelessly since 2011 to obtain accountability,"" they said, adding that: ""There are limited avenues for victims and their families to obtain justice and redress."" The International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction in Syria, since the country is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, leaving countless victims of the conflict with few options to seek accountability. In their pursuit of justice, Syrians are increasingly turning to European courts -- especially those in Germany and France -- under the concept of ""universal jurisdiction."" It gives a national court jurisdiction over grave crimes against international law, even when they were not committed on the country's territory. Earlier this year, a German court convicted a former Syrian officer for crimes against humanity, in the first-ever trial of people linked to the regime in Damascus. Another remains on trial. Clémence Bectarte, a lawyer at FIDH, said they chose to file this case in Russia due to ""the unique opportunity because of the strong legal basis to claim jurisdiction in Russia ... this is the natural court for this case."" ""We are talking about Russian perpetrators, people who could potentially be arrested in Russia if there was a political and judicial willingness to push the case forward. Universal jurisdiction always has to be considered as a last resort,"" Bectarte added. So far there has been no movement on the lawsuit filed by Abdullah in Moscow. A similar request in 2019 by Novaya Gazeta to Russia's main investigative body -- the Investigative Committee -- to open a probe into its findings in Mohamad's case was dismissed. Abdullah has never heard of Wagner. He says he just wants to see his brother's executioners held accountable. ""If someone hadn't given them the green light, they wouldn't have done something like that,"" he said. ""We will not be like them and demand [that] what happened to my brother [also] happen to them, [but] the least they deserve is jail."" Abdullah says his brother's death has left him facing a series of challenges, from caring for Mohamad's wife and children to dea",13,4.815470938823531,6.179951397428246,-1.3644804586047146,6
2021-06-07,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/07/politics/president-joe-biden-cyber-attacks-russia-putin-trump-economy/index.html,Ransomware attacks saddle Biden with grave national security crisis,"The Biden administration Sunday confronted the implications of a sudden and grave national security challenge as ransom-demanding cyber hackers target the staples of American life -- food, gas, water, hospitals and transport. The assaults, which have led the FBI director to make comparisons to 9/11, are targeting the country's vulnerable infrastructure as it struggles back to life after pandemic shutdowns and are putting civilians on the front lines of an invisible conflict likely to defy quick fixes to lessen the threat. They leave President Joe Biden, who took office amid multiple crises, with thorny dilemmas about how to respond without escalating a full-on international cyber war and expose him to new political vulnerability. Many of the attacks appear to be the work of criminal gangs on Russian soil, heaping more pressure on the President's already tense, high-stakes summit next week with President Vladimir Putin during his first foreign trip. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a congressional hearing on Monday that Biden would make clear when he saw the Russian leader that ""states cannot be in the business of harboring those who are engaged in these kinds of attacks."" His comment came after Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm Sunday warned that ""very malign actors"" had the US in their sights after attacks on a pipeline, government agencies, a Florida water system, schools, health care institutions and, even last week, the meat industry and a ferry service to millionaire's playground Martha's Vineyard. ""Even as we speak, there are thousands of attacks on all aspects of the energy sector and the private sector generally ... it's happening all the time,"" Granholm told Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Alarmingly, the former Michigan governor said that foreign hackers have the capability to shut down the US power network, and counseled firms against paying ransoms demanded by hackers. A price to pay Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, warned that the US was now reaping the consequences for failing to respond sufficiently boldly to past attacks by China, Russia and North Korea. ""We have been a cheap date. And you can't defend yourself simply by bobbing and weaving and patching. The adversary has to understand they will pay a price, there will be a cost for attacking the United States or for attacking our critical infrastructure,"" King said, also on ""State of the Union."" The frank comments from the senator and the secretary followed even more strident warnings from FBI Director Christopher Wray, who put the threat in perspective with striking language in a Wall Street Journal interview last week. He agreed there were similarities in the challenges posed by ransomware hackers, who implant computer code that locks systems until victims pay up, to those of the September 11, 2001, when al Qaeda operatives plotted the worst terror attack in US history. ""There are a lot of parallels,"" Wray said, adding that the US government, the private sector and individual Americans needed to recognize the menace. The Justice Department signaled it plans to coordinate its anti-ransomware efforts with the same protocols as it does for terrorism. Like the attackers on 9/11, hackers are exploiting gaps in US security systems, and raising questions about the capacity of US intelligence agencies and government departments to combine effectively to thwart attacks. Unlike after the attacks on New York and the Pentagon in 2001, the new threat is exposing fractured US political unity. Republicans were quick to seize on the aftermath of the recent hack on the Colonial Pipeline that sparked gas shortages, panic buying and long lines at the pumps last month to suggest Biden was weak and had lost control. Ex-President Donald Trump, who is seeking a political comeback, claimed Saturday that cyberattacks showed lost respect for US leaders since he left office. Such political opportunism raises doubts over whether Biden would be able to unite Washington around him, if he needed to muster a counter-attack from a major breach of US cyber defenses by a hostile foreign power. Biden to plot defense then go on offense Given the wide scope of the attacks, the White House must hurriedly muster the defenses of a vulnerable private sector while planning responses that can, as King suggests, make culprits pay a painful price. Biden has already signed an executive order requiring his government to make ""bold changes"" and ""significant investments"" to protect the nation's digital infrastructure that is meant to spur similar precautions by private firms. On Thursday, the National Security Council's top cyber official, Anne Neuberger, wrote an open letter to corporate executives sounding the alarm and warning the private sector needs to do much better. And quickly. ""All organizations must recognize that no company is safe from being targeted by ransomware, regardless of size or location,"" Neuberger wrote. But given the huge cost of sweeping changes to cybersecurity posture and security, and the fact that all it takes is one computer user to inadvertently open the gateway to cyber attackers through malware, swiftly ensuring comprehensive protection in the corporate sector is a tough challenge. John Negroponte, the first director of national intelligence -- a post created to fix intelligence agency dysfunction revealed by the 9/11 attacks -- said Biden's executive order was excellent and praised Neuberger in an appearance on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Friday. But he argued the government may need to force private firms to do more to disclose cyberattacks, saying that a serious attack, for instance, on a health care system could cost lives and cause a deep economic impact. ""I think there's been a reluctance to move because I think the private sector has resisted being compelled to cooperate in certain areas. And I think ultimately, there is going to have to be legislation,"" Negroponte said. A showdown with Putin The FBI has said that the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline was likely orchestrated by the ransomware network known as DarkSide, which experts suspect is based in Russia. The White House said last week that an attack on JBS USA, one of the world's largest food companies, was the work of a ""criminal organization likely based in Russia."" The new assaults mean even greater scrutiny for Biden's summit in Geneva with Putin on June 16. The US and Russia are already divided by election interference, Moscow's pressure on Ukraine, human rights and strategic issues. But the US President will now be under even more pressure to publicly lay down the law to a rival who has managed at various times to outfox the last three US Presidents. Biden last week offered a cursory ""No"" when asked whether Putin was testing him. Putin, with the poker face of a former KGB officer, last week said accusations against Moscow were nonsense, Reuters reported. The fact that the attacks are blamed on private firms gives Putin a veneer of deniability. But given the nature of the Russian security state and the nexus between organized crime and the intelligence services, it is fair to conclude that Putin could stop the attacks if he wanted to. In fact, the attacks appear to align with the Russian leader's interests. The thrust of his foreign policy over the last decade or so has been to weaken the United States in order to enhance Russia's relative power and prestige. The chaos and political recriminations sparked by cyberattacks are paralleled by the internal discord sown by what US spy agencies say is Russia's disinformation and propaganda warfare during the last two US election campaigns -- on behalf of Trump. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said Sunday that the Russians need to start paying a price for tacit acceptance of criminal ransomware attacks. ""You really have to treat Russia like it's virtually a criminal enterprise,"" Blunt said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""You know, they harbor criminals, they don't appreciate the rule of law or any kind of level of personal freedom. And I do think we have to push back."" Retaliation is a danger in itself The question of what kind of retaliation the US should launch is a fraught one. To begin with, the cyber warfare battlefield is in the shadows, meaning there is little public evidence of actions the US may already have taken or the cathartic satisfaction of visible reprisals. But any counter-attacks need to be calibrated to avoid an escalation that could not only cause a dangerous standoff between the US and other nuclear powers but could also simply invite more attacks on US soil. In April, the administration announced sanctions, including for Russia's interference in the 2020 US election and the attack on software developer SolarWinds -- one of the worst data breaches to ever hit the US government. But there is little evidence of an effective deterrence. Microsoft recently said that hackers who are part of the same Russian group behind the SolarWinds hack have struck against more than 150 government agencies, think tanks and other organizations in the US and elsewhere. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told CNN in an interview last month that the US has the ""capability to conduct offensive operations"" and also to defend itself -- but refused to specify exactly what the US might do. That is Biden's problem as he wrestles with yet another cascading crisis.",3,6.634728731557174,3.2790862045467786,3.3556425270103953,23
2021-05-05,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/05/europe/ukraine-foreign-minister-dmytro-kuleba-blinken-trump-intl/index.html,"The Trump administration was a 'difficult time' for Ukraine, says foreign minister","The years of the Trump administration were ""a difficult time"" for Ukraine, the country's foreign minister told CNN Wednesday, ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Kiev. In an exclusive and wide-ranging interview, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also touched on the buildup of Russian forces on Ukraine's border, potential military support from the United States, and President Joe Biden's offer of a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Kuleba's comments about Donald Trump's fraught term in the White House follow the 2019 scandal involving Trump and allegations that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival Biden and his son, Hunter ahead of the 2020 election. The long-running crisis upended politics in Washington, and evolved into a full-blown impeachment investigation -- of which Trump was later acquitted. Kuleba said of the Trump administration: ""It was a difficult time and at that point we were all focused on one thing ... on maintaining bipartisan support in the United States."" The minister added that the Ukrainian government will continue to invest in relations with both Democrats and Republicans in the US to ensure relations between the two countries are on more ""solid ground."" Giuliani was 'playing politics' Kuleba also told CNN that he was ""not aware"" of any formal request for assistance from the FBI, concerning Trump's long-time attorney Rudy Giuliani. Last month, federal agents executed a search warrant at the Manhattan home of Giuliani in connection with a long-running criminal investigation into his involvement with Ukraine in the latter years of Trump's presidency. Kuleba said Ukraine would be ""open to helping"" any FBI request, as the country has ""nothing to hide."" The minister added that he could not say if Giuliani acted criminally. But Kuleba said that ""he was definitely playing politics and he put the situation at risk for Ukraine, and for the country's relationship with Washington."" ""We did our best to avoid the trap and maintain that bipartisan support from the United States."" Creeping annexation Secretary of State Blinken's visit to Ukraine on Wednesday comes at another delicate moment in the country's relationship with Russia, amid a buildup of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border and in Crimea. ""[We are] gravely concerned,"" Kuleba said of the movements. ""I think every country would be extremely concerned seeing how hundreds and thousands of troops and heavy military machinery is being masked along your border."" Kuleba raised concerns about Russia's recent assertion in what should be shared waters between Ukraine and Russia in the Sea of Azov calling it a ""creeping annexation."" In a show of force, Moscow recently sealed off the strategic Sea of Azov to non-Russian state vessels until October in what Ukraine says is a violation of international law, and against a 2003 agreement between Ukraine and Russia to share the waters. ""The Sea of Azov...is low hanging fruit for Russia. After the illegal annexation of Crimea and the takeover of the control over the Kerch Strait, Russia can conduct this creeping annexation of the Sea of Azov. And it's constantly reinforcing its military presence there and disrupting trade routes,"" Kuleba told CNN. The massing of Russian troops in the region over recent weeks has reignited tensions in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists demanding independence from Kiev since 2014. The Kremlin has repeatedly said these are just military exercises, but Kuleba rejected any suggestion that the risk posed by Russia was being overstated, saying the threat was ""real."" ""When green men appeared in Crimea in 2014, Russia claimed these were not their soldiers, that it was not Russia and yet the peninsula was illegally occupied by Russian military forces,"" he said. ""Green men"" is the Ukrainian term for professional soldiers wearing Russian combat fatigues but no identifying insignia. ""So at least today, they admit that it's them, but they're just exercising. But even if it's just an exercise, what they've been exercising is an encirclement of Ukraine, and offensive operations against Ukraine."" NATO membership Amid this tension, Kuleba said he would be discussing a ""list"" of US military support with Blinken, when he arrives in Kiev. As part of this, Ukraine will request air defense systems and anti-sniper technology, said Kuleba. ""I want to make it clear that it's not only about receiving it from the United States, but also about buying it from the United States,"" he added. ""We want this partnership to work both ways. It should be mutually beneficial."" Kuleba said he wants Ukraine to be treated by the United States as the ""eastern border of democracy"" in the central Europe and Black Sea region and be integrated into the West -- including NATO. Indeed the minister believes Ukraine's ascension to NATO will arrive in only a matter of time. ""The path to NATO membership is absolutely on the table already ... NATO membership does not come in a day. We have plenty of time to settle the conflict. But we have to have a clear a step by step road map of our accession to NATO. And this is where the United States can help us."" 'Beautiful piece of diplomacy' As for Biden's recent offer of a summit with Putin, Kuleba was optimistic, calling it ""a beautiful piece of diplomacy."" He believed the summit offer ""bought time,"" as Putin would not break rules while a meeting is being planned to discuss the rules -- even if not all Ukrainians saw it that way. ""I understand those who do feel anxious (about the summit), because of the lack of information, because of conspiracy theories, because of the inherited fear of betrayal,"" he said. ""But I see it from another perspective -- from the professional diplomatic perspective. And I do not see anything that would go against the interests of Ukraine, at least at this point,"" Kuleba added. Correction: A quote in this story has been corrected to reflect that Foreign Minister Kuleba described Russian operations around Ukraine as offensive, not defensive.",29,1.8261418376905054,1.4334942303774736,0.39264760731303183,4
2021-04-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/29/politics/military-intel-leader-russia/index.html,Top US military intelligence official says Russian military poses an 'existential threat' to the US,"The top US military intelligence official said during a congressional hearing on Thursday that the Russian military is an ""existential threat"" to the United States. ""The Russian military is an existential threat to the United States,"" Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about worldwide threats. Berrier said the country's military is being used to maintain influence over states ""along its periphery, compete with US global primacy and compel adversaries who challenge Russia's vital national interests."" ""Moscow continues to invest in its strategic nuclear forces, in new capabilities to enhance its strategic deterrent, and that places the US homeland at risk,"" Berrier said. Berrier's comments come as tensions between Russia and the US remain high. The US unveiled sanctions against Moscow earlier this month over its interference in the 2020 US presidential election, the SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and ""severe human rights abuses"" in Crimea. President Joe Biden told a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night that Russia's ""actions will have consequences if they turn out to be true, and they turned out to be true,"" referring to Moscow's interference in the election and the SolarWinds cyberattack. ""So I responded directly and proportionately to Russia's interference in our elections and cyberattacks on our government and our businesses -- they did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have. But we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interests,"" Biden said. The White House is hammering out the details of a possible European summit between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could happen as soon as early summer, according to sources familiar with the planning. Tensions high but a summit could take place Russia has not yet responded officially to the United States' offer of a summit, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday. ""We are still looking into this proposal and analyzing the situation,"" Peskov said. ""Each time Washington's words about the summit meeting are accompanied by words about the need for Russia to pay some kind of price and about inevitable sanctions. So of course, deep analysis is required here."" Russia appeared to be pulling back from a possible confrontation with the West last week as Russian state media reported that troops were returning to their bases after taking part in exercises near the border with Ukraine and in Crimea. A buildup of Russian troops along the border in recent weeks had reignited tensions in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists demanding independence from Kiev since 2014. ""At present, military units and formations are marching to railway stations, airfields, loading onto landing ships, railway platforms and military transport aircraft,"" Tass reported on April 23, citing the Ministry of Defense. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu's announcement came weeks after Moscow initiated the largest buildup of troops near the Ukrainian border since 2014. It was unclear from the announcement how many troops would remain in the region. Berrier emphasized that the Russian military's power comes from its investment into and development of nuclear weapons as well as its ""conventional force largely postured for defensive and regional operations."" ""Russia has a growing ability to project power with long-range precision cruise missiles and limited expeditionary capabilities,"" he added. Berrier pointed out that Russian military leaders are ""incorporating lessons from Russia's involvement in Syria into training and exercises."" When questioned by Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican, about Russia's nuclear warhead development, Berrier confirmed Defense Intelligence Agency assessments from 2018 that stated Russia is updating its nuclear warhead production complex and is producing ""hundreds of nuclear warheads each year,"" saying those assessments are still valid. Berrier also confirmed that while the US is adhering to the nuclear testing moratorium, Russia is not. ""The United States believes that Russia probably is not adhering to the nuclear testing moratorium in the manner consistent with the yield, or with the zero yield standard. The United States, by contrast, is upholding a zero yield standard, end quote,"" Fischer said. ""Does that still remain DIA's assessment?"" ""It does, Senator,"" Berrier said.",29,1.7239088115876005,2.5486553824200042,-0.8247465708324038,2
2021-04-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/22/europe/russia-military-ukraine-border-exercises-intl/index.html,Russia pulls back troops after massive buildup near Ukraine border,"Russia appeared to be pulling back from a confrontation with the West on Friday as state media reported that troops were returning to their bases after taking part in exercises near the border with Ukraine and in Crimea. A buildup of Russian troops along the border in recent weeks had reignited tensions in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists demanding independence from Kiev since 2014. But on Thursday Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu suddenly declared that the troops had completed their drills in the south of the country near Ukraine and Crimea, and would return to their permanent bases by May 1. ""I believe that the objectives of the snap drill have been fully achieved. The troops have demonstrated the ability to provide a reliable defense of the country,"" Shoigu said at a meeting in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Kiev in 2014. ""At present, military units and formations are marching to railway stations, airfields, loading onto landing ships, railway platforms and military transport aircraft,"" Tass reported on Friday, citing the Ministry of Defense. Shoigu's announcement came weeks after Moscow initiated the largest buildup of troops near the Ukrainian border since 2014. It was unclear from Thursday's announcement how many troops would remain in the region. More than 10,000 servicemen and 1,200 units of weapons and military equipment took part in the ""snap inspection"" according to Tass. Ukrainian military officials told CNN earlier this month they estimate an extra 50,000 Russian troops had gathered in recent weeks across the Russia-Ukraine border and in Crimea. The European Union put the figure even higher, estimating on Tuesday that more than 100,000 troops had amassed near the border and in Crimea. State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Thursday acknowledged Russia's announcement, saying that the US would continue to closely monitor the situation with Ukrainian officials and other allies, but added that ""what we'll be looking for is action."" ""We have made clear in our engagement with the Russian government that it needs to refrain from escalatory actions and immediately cease all its aggressive activity in and around Ukraine, including its recent military buildup in occupied Crimea, and on Ukraine's border, and its intention to block specific vessels in the parts of the Black Sea,"" Price said at a briefing Thursday. Some weapons from Russia's 41st army, which include tanks and heavy artillery, will be left behind until the joint Russian-Belarusian Zapad-2021 strategic military exercises take place in September, according to Russian state news agency TASS. That leaves Russia with more firepower on the Ukrainian border than it had previously. Conflict Intelligence Team, a Russian open-source intelligence group that has been monitoring Russia's aggressive military buildup on the border, suggested Thursday that it was too early to judge whether the news amounted to a de-escalation. ""By our assessment, the forces remaining at Ukraine's border still present a danger of deployment into occupied Eastern Ukraine, while a large-scale invasion of government-controlled territory would certainly require moving more troops to the border,"" CIT said on Twitter. On Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said more than 20 ships had taken part in exercises in the Black Sea, which borders both countries. ""A unit of ships consisting of frigates ""Admiral Makarov"" and ""Admiral Essen"", small missile ships ""Grayvoron"" and ""Vyshny Volochek"", as well as missile boats, small anti-submarine ships and large amphibious ships conducted an exercise to repel air attack means of a simulated enemy using active electronic jamming and the conditional use of air defense means,"" a ministry statement read. Shoigu, who oversaw the drills in annexed Crimea near Ukraine's southern border on Thursday, said Russia's military had to be ready to respond swiftly to any ""unfavorable"" development given NATO's ongoing Defender-Europe military exercises. Defender-Europe is an annual, large-scale US Army-led multinational exercise designed to build readiness and interoperability between the US and its NATO partner militaries. It was canceled last year over coronavirus concerns. ""Every year in Europe, the Alliance conducts up to 40 major operational training events with a clear anti-Russian focus. In the spring of this year, the combined armed forces of NATO began the most ambitious exercise in the past 30 years,"" Shoigu said. He accused the military and political leadership of Ukraine of seeking to destabilize the situation in the Donbass conflict zone, and said the United States and NATO continued to conduct ""provocative activities"" in the airspace and waters of the Black Sea. The NATO alliance has expressed deep concern over the Russian military buildup near Ukraine, described by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last week as ""part of a broader pattern of Russian aggressive action. ""Allies fully support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and we call on Russia to de-escalate immediately, stop its pattern of aggressive provocations and respect its international commitments,"" he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday invited President Vladimir Putin to meet in the Donbass, urging his Russian counterpart to restore a ceasefire in the eastern region where he said ""millions of lives"" are at stake. Putin said Thursday he was willing to discuss bilateral relations with Zelensky in the Russian capital, TASS reported. Ukraine has been trying to bolster international support in its deadlock with Moscow, and has urged its Western allies to pledge new sanctions to discourage the Kremlin from resorting to more military force. In his speech on Tuesday, Zelensky called on Ukrainian citizens to unite in the face of the Russian military threat. ""Ukraine and Russia, despite their common past, look to the future differently. We are we. You are you. But this is not necessarily a problem, it is an opportunity. At the very least -- an opportunity, before it's too late, to stop the deadly mathematics of future military losses."" He blamed Russia for refusing to support a ""general statement"" to restore a full ceasefire in the area, despite ""the support of all parties."" In his annual address to the nation on Wednesday, Putin warned foreign powers not to cross Moscow's ""red lines,"" but made no mention of the military buildup near Ukraine. Last week, the Ukrainian President met in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- who joined via video link -- to discuss the deteriorating security situation in eastern Ukraine and the occupation of Ukrainian territories. The three leaders ended their meeting calling on Russia to withdraw extra troops amassed on the Ukrainian border. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated where in Russia the military exercises were taking place. They were in southern Russia and Crimea.",29,1.6957822144067964,0.47719765999521896,1.2185845544115774,4

Zelensky extended the invitation on Tuesday night during a public address, urging Putin to restore a ceasefire in the region where he said ""millions of lives"" are at stake. ""A proposal was made to meet at the contact line in order to see and understand the situation as accurately as possible. What should I understand? I go there every month. Mr Putin!"" Zelensky said. ""I am ready to go even further and invite you to meet anywhere in the Ukrainian Donbass, where there is a war,"" he said.

The US has assessed that the Russian military has moved more than 40 battalion tactical groups toward the Russia-Ukraine border, which could total up 40,000 troops. It would be the largest buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine since 2014, when Russian forces invaded the country and occupied the Crimean Peninsula.

2021-04-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/europe/salisbury-suspects-czech-republic-intl/index.html,"Two Russian agents have been linked to a high-profile poisoning and a deadly explosion, but there's little Europe can do","That the Czech Republic is pointing the finger at two Russian agents for a deadly explosion at an ammunition depot in the country is remarkable. The fact that the agents in question are the same pair accused of trying to poison a former Russian spy on English soil is nothing short of astounding. On Saturday, Czech police released images of two men they said were linked to a blast which killed two people at a repository in Vrbetice in 2014. The photographs matched those of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, the names the prime suspects traveled under during their alleged involvement in the near-fatal poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018. A day later, the UK foreign office said that according to Czech authorities, the two men charged with the Skripals' attempted murder ""were also behind the deaths of two civilians and an explosion in the Czech town of Vrbetice."" A Czech government source with direct knowledge of the investigation said Monday that police suspect the explosion was premature and not meant to happen on Czech territory. The source, who requested anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said the Czech police's organized crime unit is pursuing a line of inquiry that suggests the ammunition was meant to explode in Bulgaria after being exported there. It is not clear why the blast happened prematurely. The Czech Republic said it would expel 18 employees of the Russian Embassy in Prague in retaliation for the 2014 explosion, which caused huge financial and environmental damage. Russia responded by expelling 20 diplomats from the Czech Republic's embassy in Moscow. On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the Czech Republic's decision ""provocative and unfriendly."" Russia mocks West The UK believes that the two men suspected of carrying out the Salisbury attack were Russian intelligence officers, first identified by the investigative website Bellingcat as Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin. The Kremlin has dismissed the allegations, and at times appeared to mock the West for its hysterical ""Russophobia."" Russian and international media subsequently confirmed the identities of Chepiga and Mishkin in interviews with residents of their home villages in Russia's north and Far East. If it's true that the same two men were behind this explosion, and Moscow's response to such serious allegations remains similarly glib, it raises serious questions about what Europe can really do to curb Russia's brazen hostility. The Skripals were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury city center on March 4, 2018; tests revealed they had been exposed to Novichok, a nerve agent described as one of the deadliest chemical weapons ever made. Moscow has denied any involvement with the Salisbury incident, and the two men claim they were in the UK as tourists. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the two men identified as suspects are ""not criminals."" But even if Putin doesn't believe they are criminals, there is ample evidence the two pair are far from innocent tourists who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Back in 2018, Britain's then-Prime Minister, Theresa May, told lawmakers that UK authorities believed the two suspects were officers of the Russian military intelligence service known as the GRU. ""The GRU is a highly-disciplined organization with a well-established chain of command, so this was not a rogue operation,"" May said in parliament. ""It was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state."" The UK's Crown Prosecution Service said at the time that it had ""concluded there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction ... [for] conspiracy to murder Sergei Skripal and the attempted murder of Skripal, [and] his daughter Yulia."" Britain's allies were equally convinced that the two men were working on behalf of the Russian government. Former US President Donald Trump expelled 60 Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning. More were expelled from 14 European Union member states, Canada and Ukraine. Cathedral enthusiasts After entering the UK under aliases and carrying out the Salisbury attack, it's thought that ""Petrov and Boshirov"" escaped home to Russia, where they are now believed to be protected by the Russian state. If the UK's version of events is correct, Russia's official response to the allegations became increasingly serious once the pair were safely home. In September 2018, Putin said Russian authorities had identified the pair and found no evidence of criminal activities. ""We, of course, looked at what kind of people they are, and we know who they are, we found them,"" Putin told an audience at the Eastern Economic Forum in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok. ""There is nothing unusual or criminal there, I assure you,"" he insisted, adding: ""Let them come out somewhere, to you in the media."" The very next day, Kremlin-backed news network RT released an almost-mocking interview with the pair, in which they claimed they were simply in the sports nutrition business and that the purpose of their 6,000-mile, three-day trip was to visit Salisbury Cathedral, with its 123-meter spire and famous clock, the ""first of its kind anywhere in the world."" UK authorities refuted the men's claims and pointed to timestamped CCTV footage tracking movements that would be extremely unusual for tourists to the country. The footage showed that the men arrived in the UK on March 2. On March 3, the day before the attack, they traveled to Salisbury, staying in the city for less than two hours. They later claimed that heavy snow had made their tourism plans impossible, though local weather reports and video footage dispute this. The following day, they returned to Salisbury, arriving in the city at 11.45am; they were seen in the vicinity of Skripal's house before midday, and boarded a train back to London at 1.50pm. That evening, they went through passport control at Heathrow Airport at 7.30pm before boarding a plane to Moscow. Just over a month after the RT interview, it was reported that one of the suspects had received a heroes' honor from Vladimir Putin. The official Russian response to Salisbury varied from pearl-clutching claims of Russophobia from diplomats to Putin himself calling Skripal a ""traitor to the Motherland"" and a ""scumbag."" Smear campaign claims Kremlin sympathizers are already claiming that the accusations leveled at the purported agents Petrov and Boshirov by Czech officials are part of a smear campaign against Russia. Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a state-sponsored think tank that hews closely to official government policy, told the BBC that: ""If you look at this whole story from the Kremlin, I think that they would conclude it was a false flag and basically the leadership of the Czech Republic is trying to do that on the eve of the EU ministerial, to make life harder for Moscow."" The meeting he refers to is a videoconference between European foreign affairs ministers planned for Monday, at which they are expected to discuss Russia's military aggression in Ukraine, the deteriorating health of imprisoned Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny and, presumably, this latest development in the Czech Republic. Russia's repeated delinquent behavior should --- on paper, at least -- make the expulsion of more diplomats and the prospect of further sanctions a slam dunk for European leaders -- especially given that US President Joe Biden appears to be in lockstep with the EU on punishing Russia. But even if the EU unites in its condemnation of Russia this week for a huge range of issues, it is unlikely the Kremlin will be perturbed by any stamping of feet. After all, if the past few years have taught Putin anything, it's this: No matter how serious the allegations against him are -- from assisting a Syrian dictator in bombing his own people to sanctioning the attempted assassination of political opponents -- European leaders cannot deny their geography. Whether it's through the supply of natural resources or digging Europe out of its vaccine shortage crisis, as long as Russia has something to offer its neighbors to the West, pragmatic appeasement will, to some extent, win the day.",3,5.798204395633552,6.013898222954304,-0.21569382732075226,27
2021-04-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/politics/world-wide-threats-hearing-senate-intelligence-committee/index.html,"US intel chief says spy agencies still do not know 'where, when or how' Covid-19 was initially transmitted","US intelligence agencies still do not know ""exactly where, when or how Covid-19 virus was transmitted initially"" in China but remain focused on two primary theories, that ""it emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals or it was a laboratory accident,"" the nation's top spy told Senate lawmakers on Wednesday. That admission from Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines came during the worldwide threats hearing. Her testimony is consistent with an intelligence community statement from almost a year ago that said it has not determined ""whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan."" That statement also said definitively the virus ""was not man-made or genetically modified."" ""It is absolutely accurate the intelligence community does not know exactly where, when, or how Covid-19 virus was transmitted initially, and basically components have coalesced around two alternative theories, these scenarios are it emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals, or it was a laboratory accident,"" Haines told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. CIA Director William Burns, who also appeared alongside other intelligence agency leaders Wednesday, that he agreed with Haines' remarks and added that it is clear to analysts ""the Chinese leadership has not been fully forthcoming or fully transparent in working with the {World Health Organization} who were providing the kind of original complete data that would help answer those questions."" ""We're doing everything we can, using all the sources available to all of us on this panel to try to get to the bottom of it,"" he added. National Security Agency director and head of US Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone noted that US cyber agencies are aiding that effort and continue to gather and analyze information around the virus' origins. A source familiar with the intelligence told CNN late last month that the intelligence community is not currently leaning one way or the other regarding the two theories. ""We will probably never know the truth, because even the Chinese don't know the truth, and it will be difficult for US intelligence to figure it out if the Chinese never do,"" the source said. ""The Chinese have NO interest in learning the truth, so it's hard to spy on them and find out what the truth is."" The source also told CNN that there is increasingly strong evidence to suggest that the wet market was not the initial source of the outbreak. Another official from a country that is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing coalition concurred: the lab theory hasn't been entirely discounted because of lack of data and access from the Chinese. China 'an unparalleled priority' for intelligence community In her opening remarks during Wednesday's hearing, Haines told lawmakers that China poses ""an unparalleled priority for the intelligence community"" and is pushing to revise global norms in ways that favor Beijing using a variety of tactics. She warned specifically that China has ""substantial"" cyber capabilities that ""if deployed, at a minimum, can cause localized, temporary disruptions to critical infrastructure inside the United States."" During her brief opening remarks, Haines also warned that global disruptions like the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and technological change are likely to produce more competition internationally and instability across the globe. That reality ""compels"" the intelligence community must broaden its definition of national security, she said. ""At no point has it been more important to invest in our norms and institutions, our workforce, and the integration of our work,"" Haines said. Afghanistan withdrawal will 'diminish' CIA ability to collect intelligence The withdrawal of US and coalition troops from Afghanistan was raised by multiple lawmakers during Wednesday's hearing as President Joe Biden is set to formally announce Wednesday that American forces will leave the country before the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. If the United States withdraws from Afghanistan -- ""whenever that time comes"" -- the CIA's ability to collect intelligence and act on potential threats there will ""diminish,"" agency director Bill Burns told the Senate Intelligence Committee. Neither al Qaeda or ISIS currently have the ability to strike the US homeland, Burns said, but ""it is clear that our ability to keep that threat in Afghanistan in check from either al Qaeda or ISIS in Afghanistan has benefited greatly from the presence of US and coalition militaries on the ground and in the air, fueled by intelligence provided by the CIA and our other intelligence partners."" The CIA's operations in Afghanistan have long depended on the traditional military presence there and questions have swirled around what kind of intelligence and counterterrorism capabilities the United States might be able to retain in Afghanistan after September 11, as Biden has vowed to do. When the US does withdraw, Burns said the United States will ""retain a suite of [intelligence] capabilities,"" some of them preexisting and some that will have to be developed to help the United States keep tabs and disrupt any effort by either al Qaeda or ISIS to rebuild. ""All of that means that there's there is a significant risk once the US military and the coalition militaries withdraw, but we will work very hard at CIA and with all of our partners to try to provide the kind of strategic warning to others in the US government, that enables them and us to address that threat if it starts to materialize,"" Burns said. Russian military buildup a 'serious concern' The Russian military buildup along its border with Ukraine, as well as in Crimea, is a ""serious concern"" and could be a precursor to ""limited military incursions"" by Russia, Burns said Wednesday, echoing comments made by other top administration officials in recent days. The moves by the Russian military could be an intimidation tactic to Ukraine's leadership, as well as signaling to the United States, Burns said. ""That buildup has reached the point where, you know, it also could provide the basis for limited military incursions as well,"" Burns told the committee. That was part of Biden's conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Burns said, in which Biden proposed a summit with Putin in the coming months. Burns, a veteran diplomat who was ambassador to Moscow, joked that ""most of my white hair came from serving in Russia and dealing with Putin's Russia over the years.""",3,2.9761514474029847,2.325720505778967,0.6504309416240175,3

According to a White House statement about the call, Biden and Putin discussed arms control and emerging security issues. Biden also called on Russia to deescalate tensions in Ukraine. The White House statement said Biden ""emphasized the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" and voiced ""concerns over the sudden Russian military build-up in occupied Crimea and on Ukraine's borders(.)"" A Kremlin statement on the call released later on Tuesday said, ""When exchanging views on the internal Ukrainian crisis, Vladimir Putin outlined approaches to a political settlement based on the Minsk Package of Measures."" The packag refers to a ceasefire agreement on conflicts in eastern Ukraine reached in 2015. The two discussed arms control issues, as well as building on the extension of the New START Treaty. According to the White House, Biden ""also made clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of its national interests in response to Russia's actions, such as cyber intrusions and election interference."" The Kremlin statement said Biden ""expressed interest in normalizing the state of affairs on the bilateral track and establishing stable and predictable interaction"" on issues like ""arms control, the Iran nuclear program, Afghanistan and climate change."" ""Both sides expressed their readiness to continue the dialogue on the most important areas of ensuring global security, which would meet the interests of not only Russia and the United States, but the entire world community,"" the statement said. The Kremlin statement also confirmed that Biden ""suggested considering the possibility of holding a personal meeting at the highest level in the foreseeable future."" This is their second known call since Biden took office in January. In March, Biden had also invited Putin to be part of a leaders summit on climate later this month. The relationship between the world leaders got off to a tumultuous start, with the US adjusting its posture with Russia by finalizing sanctions in the wake of the poisoning and jailing of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, the SolarWinds hack and its placing of bounties on US troops serving in Afghanistan. During an interview in March, Biden called Putin a killer, saying that the Russia In leader ""will pay a price"" for his efforts to undermine the 2020 US election. In response, the Kremlin recalled its ambassador to the US for the first time in more than 20 years. Putin responded to Biden's criticisms with a dry wish for ""good health"" and a proposal for a live televised debate. The situation between Russia and Ukraine has escalated in recent weeks as the Russians have sent more troops to the area. In response the US has considered sending warships into the Black Sea in the next few weeks in a show of support for Ukraine, a US defense official told CNN Thursday. The US Navy routinely operates in the Black Sea, but a deployment of warships now would send a specific message to Moscow that the US is closely watching, the official said. The Defense official also said the Navy is continuing to fly reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Black Sea to monitor Russian naval activity and any troops movements in Crimea.

2021-04-12,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/12/europe/ukraine-zelensky-front-lines/index.html,Ukraine's President heads to the trenches as Russia masses its troops,"Ankle-deep in thick black sludge, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky moves stealthily with his troops in single file through the warren of trenches and tunnels that form the tense front lines in the east of his country. It feels more like the early 20th century than a modern conflict, with tired, nervous soldiers gripping their rifles around him as they reach open ground, scanning the area for movement across no-mans-land. They know snipers, likely trained by Russians, say Ukrainian officials are looking for a chance to fire. More than 20 of their comrades have been gunned down already this year. It's eerily quiet with an occasional crack of a gunshot in the distance shattering the calm, keeping everybody on edge. This area near Mariupol is a risky place for the President of a country to visit, but that doesn't stop Zelensky who granted CNN unprecedented access to his trip to the front lines, where he insists on going to the most forward positions. ""If I visit a military base, the guys at the very front will hear about it and think I forgot about them,"" Zelensky told CNN in exclusive comments over two days. ""They need to know they have political support."" Zelensky, strapped into a camouflage flak jacket and helmet, has to sprint across the open ground with his presidential security to reach the trench cover. With Russian troops massing on their side of the border with Ukraine, the US and its NATO allies declared political and military backing for Ukraine. Zelensky urged them to bolster their support. New boiling point in long standoff For years, the brutal conflict in eastern Ukraine, between government forces and Russian-backed separatists, has been locked in a tense standoff. Major combat, which cost thousands of lives since 2014, has given way to a grinding stalemate. Following the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, fighting erupted in the neighboring Donbas region -- another mainly Russian speaking area of Ukraine with rebels demanding independence from Kiev. But amid growing tensions with the United States and its Western allies, Russian forces have again been spotted on the move across the border sparking concerns the war may be reignited. Cell phone video has emerged of Russian armored columns driving towards the Ukrainian frontier. Tanks and artillery guns have been seen being transported by rail. There's also been a build-up reported in Crimea. In Moscow, the Kremlin says the troop movements are inside Russia, part of a planned military exercise and pose no threat. But at the front lines, the Ukrainian President told CNN a Russian invasion is a very real possibility his country is bracing for. ""Of course. We know it, from 2014 we know it can be each day,"" he said. ""They are ready, but we are also ready because we are on our land and our territory,"" he told CNN. Lt. Gen. Ruslan Khomchak, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, told CNN an estimated 50,000 Russian troops have now gathered across the Russian border and in Crimea. In addition, there are at least 35,000 Russian-backed separatists in rebel-held areas of Ukraine, he said. Even before this current worrying build up in the number of troops at Moscow's command on Ukraine's doorstep, Zelensky called for the US to sell it weapons, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles. Those weapons have now been delivered, most notoriously in a phone conversation with then-President Donald Trump. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that there are ""real concerns"" over Russia's action. On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Blinken said, ""The question is, 'Is Russia going to continue to act aggressively and recklessly?' If it does, the [US] President's been clear, there'll be costs, there'll be consequences."" CNN reported Friday that the US is considering sending warships into the Black Sea in the next few weeks in a show of support for Ukraine. Lurching to the future From the air, above the muddy trenches, the seemingly endless flatness of eastern Ukraine is punctuated by battered towns and the rusting industrial hulks of the Soviet-era factories that made this war-ravaged region Ukraine's economic backbone. Military helicopters, deafening old MI-8s first developed during the Soviet era, painted in unnaturally vivid combat camouflage, fly fast and low over the countryside to avoid ground fire. Every few minutes they lurch upwards to leapfrog trees or electricity lines, then quickly plunge back down again within feet of the soil. On board the aging presidential chopper, which retains a degree of well-worn comfort, Zelensky shouts above the engine noise of how the US is a ""good friend"" of Ukraine, but that President Biden ""must do more,"" to deter Russia and help bring this conflict to an end. More weapons, more money to fight, and, crucially, more support to join NATO, the Western military alliance where an attack on one member commits all to respond, he explained. ""If they [the US] see Ukraine in NATO, they have to say it directly, and do it. Not words,"" Zelensky told CNN. But the chances of that are slim, amid concerns that moving Ukraine closer to NATO membership would provoke Moscow, possibly fueling a broader conflict. ""Maybe you are right,"" Zelensky responds. ""But what now is going on? What we do here? What do our people do here? They fight."" At the front line, Zelensky led a minute of silence for the fallen. With or without NATO, this is his country's reality. Ukraine is at war.",29,2.8013959207193113,1.4840024993714327,1.3173934213478786,4
2021-04-09,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/09/europe/russian-forces-ukraine-border-analysis-intl/index.html,"Russian forces are massing on Ukraine's border. Bluff or not, Putin is playing with fire","For an army given to masking its moves, surely the worst way to disguise a potential imminent invasion of a country is by overtly preparing for it. This is the paradox around Russia's visible buildup in its west, not far from the Ukrainian border. Were Moscow trying to reverse the military stalemate around the Donbas separatist region -- that it truncated from Ukraine in 2014 -- would it want to telegraph its moves so blatantly? Russia's signals are obvious. Relentless social media videos show armored convoys moving towards the general border area. These led to open-source intelligence sleuths @CITeam_en spotting a congregation of likely hundreds of vehicles not far from the Russian city of Voronezh. That is still over 100 miles from Ukraine, but it is a sizeable buildup that was captured on satellite images from the Maxar technology group. The White House said this week that Russia now has more troops near the Ukraine border than any time since 2014 -- when the peninsula of Crimea was annexed. Further south, military intelligence reports have assessed that some 4,000 heavily armed Russian forces had been seen moving in Crimea, a US defense official told CNN. Moscow is also talking the game. Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu has announced snap readiness inspections for the army. The Kremlin's envoy to the conflict, deputy head of the presidential administration Dmitri Kozak, said that Moscow would, as has pretty much always been implied, come to the defense of Ukraine's eastern population if needed. And he said the start of a conflict would be the ""beginning of the end of Ukraine."" Russia's declarations are pretty noisy. For Ukraine's part, President Volodymyr Zelensky has moved some units closer to the Donbas, and took a very high-profile trip to the area Thursday. Like Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Zelensky's domestic ratings are not that healthy. He talked the language of peace. He tried to be close to the troops, aware that US President Joe Biden has said he will stand by him. The White House has said it is ""increasingly concerned by recent escalating Russian aggressions in eastern Ukraine"" and US officials have also hinted they might send warships to the Black Sea, a signal of increased involvement, even though American aircraft have regularly been monitoring that area. German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked Putin to pull his forces back during a call on Thursday. Everyone is getting very excitable, very fast. Speculation about what comes next in the biggest land war in Europe in two decades is as rife as the Kremlin surely hope it would be. Meanwhile, its sole cost so far is the fuel bill of moving a lot of tanks around. The key as-yet-unanswered question is what Russia's objective would be in a military intervention. Some analysts have speculated it might flood the separatist areas and adjacent conflict zones with a huge Russian ""peacekeeping"" force, designed to impose its will and rules on the area -- effectively annexing the Donbas in earnest. Yet this would almost guarantee a Western response, likely at first in the form of sanctions. It would also achieve for Moscow essentially the same control it has now on these areas, albeit with lot of expensive Russian skin and hardware in the game. It is all the squeeze, with none of the juice, and so probably not that favorable to the Kremlin. The second option floated by analysts involves the creation of a land corridor between separatist Donbas in the east and Crimea, the annexed peninsula to the south of Ukraine. For years, water has been a scarce resource in Crimea, a crisis which a senior Ukrainian official warned me two years ago could reach a critical stage in the summer of 2019. It still persists, along with the broader challenge for Moscow of maintaining a passable standard of life in Crimea through sea supplies, and over a small, new bridge it has made across the Kerch Strait. It is not a sustainable state of affairs for Russia's latest acquisition in the long term. But a land corridor -- a strip running through the Ukrainian town of Mariupol and to the Armiansk area above Crimea -- would also be extremely vulnerable for any occupying Russian forces. They would be caught between the Azov Sea and a very angry, better-equipped-than-before, Ukrainian army. To hold that corridor effectively, they would have to push deeper into Ukraine, and then face yet more resistance from the Ukrainian army and the local population. Long gone is the hope from 2014 that Russian soldiers would be seen as ""liberators"" from a corrupt Kiev government. Hostility is much more palpable. So the task ahead of the Russian army is either do so little that the inevitable Western sanctions seem imposed for minimal gain. Or do so much (way too much) that you have to occupy large swathes of Ukraine for years. It's a mess both ways. In Moscow's eyes then, a perhaps much better option is to amass its forces, make loud noises about Ukraine's desire for war, hint at diplomacy and use its heavy-metal-gloved-hand across the border to force a better, negotiated solution. This of course presumes the Kremlin head is always making the best decisions. Putin is also capable of overreach or folly. A third invasion of Ukraine in 2021 is also a much more dangerous gamble for Putin than the one he took in 2014-15. US President Biden has made it clear he'll offer ""unwavering support"" to Kiev. Washington's mindset is irrevocably hardened to the idea that Russia is a threat. And Ukrainian leader Zelensky, as politically and militarily inexperienced as he is, will doubtless benefit domestically from being dragged into a conflict he hasn't started. Yet two enduring, unquantifiable risks remain. The first is that Putin may see, among all the chaos of the next few weeks, a moment of opportunity to strike, and simply decide to deal with the consequences later. The second is the inevitable peril of amassing angry forces on both sides of an already active front line. An unanticipated error or surge by either party could spiral into a bigger war. If Moscow hopes its buildup means its phones start ringing more frequently, and diplomacy takes over, then it would better happen soon.",14,0.9780532060594835,3.9990042216354658,-3.0209510155759824,16
2021-03-24,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/24/europe/bulgaria-russian-spy-ring-cmd-intl/index.html,How an alleged Russian spy ring stole NATO and EU secrets from Bulgaria,"Secretly shot video tells the story of an alleged spy ring at work in Bulgaria's capital. A woman in a white jacket arrives at the Russian embassy in Sofia; she is seen in animated conversation with someone unidentified. Inside a government office, a surveillance camera catches a man counting money at his desk, apparently the reward for his espionage. And in an intercepted phone call, the alleged leader of the group is heard telling an accomplice how his father cried when Stalin died. Then they talk money. The recordings, made by Bulgarian investigators, were released on Friday as prosecutors announced charges against six Bulgarians -- several of them senior or former defense officials -- on suspicion of spying for Russia. Prosecutors alleged that the group ""posed a serious threat to national security by collecting and handing to a foreign country state secrets of Bulgaria, NATO and the European Union."" They also released a memo allegedly written by the group's leader, in a mixture of Bulgarian and Russian, setting out the spy ring's priorities, which included gathering information on NATO meetings, EU policy towards Russia and intelligence on Ukraine and Belarus. According to prosecutors, of particular interest to the spies was the recently inaugurated NATO Maritime Coordination Center in Varna, on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast. The group's apparent unmasking came days before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's first visit to NATO -- with Russia very much on the agenda - and amid signs that the Biden administration is intent on taking a tougher stance towards Moscow than that pursued by former President Donald Trump. ""The days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions ... are over,"" Biden said last month. A State Department spokesman tweeted last week that the US was ""attentively watching"" the Bulgarian investigation and that it ""stands with Bulgarians against these malign activities."" Prosecutors said the woman arrested, who has not been named, has dual Bulgarian-Russian nationality and served as the intermediary with the embassy. In return she purportedly received cash for the group's operations. Prosecutors also said she is the wife of the spy ring's leader. They referred to him as ""The Resident"" and said he is a high-ranking former member of Bulgaria's defense ministry. Several of those arrested held senior positions at Bulgaria's Defense Ministry and in the Military Intelligence Service, suggesting the alleged conspiracy may have had access to highly-classified information. The country's chief prosecutor, Ivan Geshev, described the espionage as ""unparalleled since 1944."" On Monday, the Bulgarian government followed up by announcing the expulsion of two Russian diplomats, bringing to eight the total number of Russian officials kicked out of Bulgaria since late 2019. Last December, Russia's military attaché in Sofia was expelled following allegations that he had gathered information on US service members stationed on Bulgarian territory during military exercises. Over the weekend, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov asked Moscow to stop its spying operations in Bulgaria. But mindful of Bulgaria's shared Slavic heritage with Russia -- and its dependence on Russian energy -- Borissov added: ""Friendship is friendship, we have always demonstrated that."" For its part, the Russian embassy in Sofia responded that the ""tireless attempts to drive a wedge into the Russian-Bulgarian dialogue and once again demonize our country are obvious."" Until 1989, Bulgaria was one of the most loyal members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. Now, as a member of NATO and the European Union, western analysts say it's a favorite target for Russian espionage. If Vienna was the epicenter of post-World War II espionage in Europe, Sofia might lay claim to that dubious title today. As a NATO member, Bulgaria occupies some critical real estate adjacent to the Black Sea. NATO aircraft fly from bases in Bulgaria in patrols over the area, which has seen more military activity by both Russia and the Alliance since Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Last year, six USAF F-16s operated from Bulgaria's Graf Ignatievo Air Base. Russians close to the Kremlin have backed pro-Russian groups in Bulgaria. One of those groups -- the Russophiles National Movement -- is led by Nikolai Malinov, who was charged by Bulgarian prosecutors in 2019 with spying and laundering money for Russian organizations. His case is yet to come to trial, and Malinov has maintained his innocence. Bulgarian prosecutors allege that he wrote a document outlining ""the steps that need to be taken to completely reform Bulgaria's geopolitical orientation, moving it away from the West and bringing it closer to Russia."" While awaiting trial, Malinov was allowed to leave Bulgaria for a trip to Moscow, where he was presented with the Russian Order of Friendship by President Vladimir Putin. Bulgaria's prosecutor-general claimed Malinov provided intelligence to a group in Russia called the Double Headed Eagle Society, which is run by oligarch Konstantin Malofeev. Malofeev is a champion of the Russian Orthodox Church and runs a TV network in Russia. He has previously suggested that Vladimir Putin should be made the Tsar of Russia. In 2019, Malofeev was banned from entering Bulgaria for ten years because of his association with Malinov, which he has acknowledged as close. They had tried but failed to purchase a Bulgarian television network. Malofeev was previously sanctioned by the US and European Union for financing separatist military groups in eastern Ukraine. He has denied that accusation. Last year Bulgarian prosecutors also charged three Russians in absentia, in connection with the poisoning of a Bulgarian weapons dealer in Sofia in 2015 using a substance believed to be the nerve agent Novichok. One of them was identified as Sergei Fedotov, allegedly an officer in Russian military intelligence. Previous attempts by CNN and other media organizations to reach Fedotov have been unsuccessful. The investigative group Bellingcat has identified Fedotov as one of three Russian intelligence agents alleged to be linked to the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018. Russia routinely denies allegations of spying in Bulgaria. Last year, Sergei Ivanov -- spokesman for Russia's foreign intelligence service -- accused US intelligence services of launching a campaign against people in eastern Europe who wanted good relations with Russia. Bulgaria, he told Russian media, had become the epicenter of this campaign. The latest arrests have sparked another crisis in relations between Moscow and Sofia, which have traditionally been close because of a shared Slavic and Orthodox culture. But if Bulgarian prosecutors are right, the Kremlin regards Bulgaria as an inviting target -- a back door into intelligence about NATO and the European Union, and weapons reaching Ukraine.",3,5.707736976164976,3.4070708429928294,2.3006661331721467,27
2021-03-15,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/15/europe/rights-groups-lawsuit-russian-wagner-mercenaries-intl/index.html,Rights groups file landmark legal case against Russian Wagner mercenaries,"Advocacy groups from Russia, France and Syria have filed a legal case against Russian mercenary group Wagner, accusing its fighters of torturing and beheading a Syrian man in 2017. The legal action, filed on behalf of a Syrian citizen, seeks to bring to light the murky activities of the guns-for-hire group with Kremlin links. Wagner is widely reported to have been deployed in Syria alongside Russian forces, which intervened in the conflict to assist President Bashar al-Assad's army in 2015. The suit represents the first time that anyone has tried to hold any member of the Wagner group accountable for its activities anywhere in the world. The announcement of the landmark case on Monday coincided with the day of the 10th anniversary of the Syrian Civil war in which Wagner's presence has been well documented by CNN, including deadly US airstrikes against the Russian fighters outside Deir Ezzor in 2017. Wagner's activities in Syria were further propelled into the spotlight after Russian independent paper Novaya Gazeta published an investigation in 2019 on the alleged involvement of the group's mercenaries in the gruesome murder of a Syrian man who was described as a deserter from the Syrian army. In June 2017, a two-minute clip appeared online showing several Russian-speaking men wearing military uniforms brutally beating an unarmed man. Two years later Novaya Gazeta obtained additional footage purporting to show what happened to the man after the beating: he was further tortured and beheaded, his body mutilated and set on fire. The paper also claimed to have identified the man, Syrian Mohammed A., as well as one of the perpetrators, a Russian man identified as an alleged member of Wagner private military company. The murder took place in Northern Syria near the al-Shaer gas facility, Novaya Gazeta said at the time. Novaya Gazeta asked Russia's main investigative body, the Investigative Committee, to open a probe into the findings but the claim was dismissed. The new case, initiated by the brother of the killed man, was filed to Russian authorities last week by three groups: the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), and Memorial Human Rights Center in Russia. Shortly after Novaya Gazeta's report came out, the Syrian SCM group was contacted by the brother of the victim, who identified his relative in one of the videos, expressing his willingness to seek justice for the brutal death of his brother. ""So far, no court has examined Russia's responsibility for direct military intervention and allowing the Wagner group to use force,"" Memorial Human Rights Center said in a statement. ""This is the first claim filed by a Syrian victim with the support of human rights NGOs [non-governmental organizations] to Russian authorities in an unprecedented attempt to overcome impunity and bring Russian suspects to justice."" According to his brother, Mohammed A. returned to Syria in March 2017 from Lebanon where he worked as a construction worker, the NGOs said. Upon return, Mohammed was arrested by the Syrian military and taken to a base for conscription service near Damascus. In their last phone conversation, Mohammed told his brother he intended to defect from the army and was never heard from again. The plaintiffs ask the Russian Investigative Committee to open an investigation on charges of ""murder committed with extreme brutality by a group of persons."" The Committee so far has not commented on the request. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday he is aware of the media reports on the matter but referred the question to the Investigative Committee. The Investigative Committee did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. Private military companies are illegal under Russian law but Wagner has been playing an increasingly prominent role in advancing Russia's off-the-books foreign policy goals abroad. CNN previously reported on Wagner activities in Ukraine, Syria, Sudan, Central African Republic, Libya and Mozambique. Advocacy groups behind the lawsuit said the unit ""is known for committing grave human rights violations against civilians, at times with extreme cruelty."" ""There is a chain of conflicts where often the same [Russia-linked] actors are involved but they are never prosecuted,"" Alexander Cherkasov, Memorial's Chairman, told CNN. ""Since there are no investigations and no punishments, we get this chain of impunity, which drags across Russia's history since at least the Chechen wars."" Russian open-source intelligence groups, such as Conflict Intelligence Team, which for years have been investigating Wagner activities, previously told CNN the unit's ambiguous legal status allows Russia to enjoy plausible deniability when it comes to reporting numbers of soldiers lost in the Syrian conflict as well as to avoid international responsibility. In 2019, Putin acknowledged the presence of Russian mercenaries in Syria but denied they are in any way supported by the government, adding that they solve ""matters of economic nature"" like exploring or retaking oil fields. ""These people risk their lives and by and large this is also a contribution in fighting terrorism ... but this is not the Russian state, not the Russian army,"" he said. Wagner group doesn't have a registered entity and CNN is not able to seek immediate comment from mercenaries mentioned in the Novaya Gazeta report. Wagner PMC is believed be financed by a Kremlin-linked businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, sanctioned by US Treasury in connection with Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. Prigozhin repeatedly denied any links to Wagner. CNN and other outlets reported that Prigozhin-linked companies have secured lucrative deals in countries of Wagner deployment, like guarding and exploring oil and gas fields in Syria or gaining permits to dig up diamonds and other precious minerals across Africa.",13,4.15588155213083,7.617826632309632,-3.4619450801788023,6
2021-02-17,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/17/politics/lloyd-austin-nato-meeting/index.html,Austin tells NATO allies US is reengaged but warns of Russian threat,"In his first appearance on the world stage meeting NATO allies, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wasted no time telling them that the Trump era of strained relations is over. ""The secretary reaffirmed the President's message that the United States intends to revitalize our relationship with the alliance,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters about the message Austin conveyed to a virtual NATO ministerial meeting that is taking place on Wednesday and Thursday. ""Secretary Austin emphasized that NATO's most important task is protecting our populations and territories by presenting credible deterrence and a strong military,"" Kirby added. Austin went beyond traditional issues emphasizing that NATO needs to protect supply chains and technologies from ""strategic competitors,"" Kirby said. The implication was clear that it is time to worry more about China and particularly Russia. Ahead of the meeting Austin used a Washington Post op-ed to underline that the US if back in full support of NATO and the US' traditional role in defense of Europe after President Donald Trump had spent his time in office criticizing the alliance. ""For the Defense Department, this means fielding a credible force, ready to back up the hard work of diplomacy. It also means working closely with our allies and partners to secure our common interests and promote our shared values abroad. Simply put, we cannot meet our responsibilities alone, nor should we try,"" Austin wrote. He is also telling NATO that the US is grateful for increased defense spending commitments by member nations but is not expected to offer commitments on issues such as the future of the US military presence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Germany, as well as other issues allies want clarity on. ""I would not expect specific decisions at this meeting,"" a senior defense official familiar with the Austin's thinking told CNN. Instead, he plans to consult allies before the US makes final decisions in contrast to Trump's go it alone attitude. Warning about Putin Austin is making clear he knows that NATO's chief rival -- Vladimir Putin's Russia -- isn't waiting. ""Aggressive and coercive behaviors from emboldened strategic competitors such as China and Russia reinforce our belief in collective security,"" Austin wrote in his Washington Post piece. ""It's very apparent Russia's a threat to all NATO allies, including the United States. Russia erodes transparency and predictability. They are using military force to achieve their goals. They support proxy groups and sow chaos and doubt, and undermining the rules-based international order,"" said a second defense official involved in US preparations for the ministerial. ""So this administration has already made clear that we will work with Russia to advance our own interests while holding them to account for their reckless and aggressive actions. And so we'll look forward to discussing that with our allies this week."" Cyber attacks by Russia continue to top the list of worries. NATO is now bringing other nations into its closed-door discussions on how to deal with that threat. Overt Russian military moves are also causing concern. Moscow is stepping up military activities in northeast Syria where the US still has 900 troops. There are concerns the Russians may not obey long agreed procedures to stay away from US areas, several defense officials say. And the US and Russia are jockeying for position and presence in the resource rich Arctic. By the end of the month B-1 bombers will begin flying out of Norway for the first time off Russia's western coast. The Russian news agency Tass reported that two Russian Tu-160 strategic bombers flew over the international waters of the Barents, Greenland and Norwegian seas earlier this month. NATO also reported several air encounters with Russia in recent days. NATO fighter aircraft from Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey on February 10, flew in response to several Russian Tu-22 long range bombers and fighter jets flying near NATO territory above the Black Sea. The Russian aircraft flew without transmitting a transponder code and did not indicate their position, altitude or file a flight plan. Keeping a robust number of US troops in Germany and deeper into NATO's eastern flank by rotating troops in Romania, Poland and even Ukraine for exercises and training would send a clear message to counter Putin, officials say. Biden already has put a hold on taking troops out of Germany pending a review and Ukraine publicly says it is going to build two new naval bases. US officials say the approach to the NATO meeting is designed to send a clear message to Moscow that the US is back in the fold and has more moves coming.",29,6.687165091255193,6.572954458530212,0.11421063272498078,2
2020-12-14,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/europe/russia-navalny-agents-bellingcat-ward/index.html,CNN-Bellingcat investigation identifies Russian specialists who trailed Putin's nemesis Alexey Navalny before he was poisoned,"At about 9 a.m. on August 13, a 33-year-old Russian woman named Maria Pevchikh checked in for a flight from Moscow to the Siberian city of Novosibirsk. She was not alone. Trailing her to Domodedovo airport that morning was a member of an elite unit of the Russian Security Service, the FSB. Oleg Tayakin, a slim, balding man with blue-green eyes, remained at the airport until Pevchikh left. Pevchikh was traveling in advance of a visit to Siberia by Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, whose anti-corruption campaign she leads. The Navalny team is constantly watched by the FSB in Russia, the successor to the Soviet Union's secret police force, the KGB. But Tayakin is no ordinary agent. He belongs to a small team specializing in toxins and nerve agents. That very morning, several of its agents were on their way to Novosibirsk, two hours ahead of Pevchikh. They knew that Navalny, a thorn in President Vladimir Putin's side for nearly a decade, would arrive in Novosibirsk the next day. Exactly one week later, Navalny would be fighting for his life -- his body ravaged by the nerve agent Novichok, his organs shutting down. He collapsed on a flight from Tomsk, the last stop on his Siberian trip. CNN joined an investigation by the group Bellingcat that has pieced together how the elite FSB unit followed Navalny's team throughout its August trip to Siberia. The investigation also found that this unit has followed Navalny on more than 30 trips to and from Moscow since 2017. In recent years the online investigative outfit Bellingcat has identified the Russian military intelligence agents sent to England to poison former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, and a Russian agent accused of murdering a Chechen activist in Berlin. Bellingcat helped uncover the pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine responsible for shooting down the MH-17 airliner in 2014. Russia has denied involvement in every case. By examining thousands of phone records along with flight manifests and other documents obtained by Bellingcat, this joint months-long investigation has identified the agents involved, as well as their backgrounds, communications and travel. The investigation also involved German magazine Der Spiegel and Russian online publication The Insider. CNN showed photographs of several of the agents to Navalny last week, during an interview at a secret location in Germany, where he is still recovering. He said he did not recognize any of them, and then paused. ""I have a very strange feeling when I watch their faces,"" Navalny said, adding it was ""absolutely terrifying"" to find out he'd been followed for so long. The shadows and their masters Bellingcat and CNN have established that the FSB's toxins team comprises six to 10 agents, including qualified doctors, toxicologists and paramedics. The FSB agents trailing Navalny -- in their late 30s and 40s -- usually traveled in groups of three, taking parallel flights as they tracked Navalny. More recently they began using burner phones. Their unit is based at a nondescript beige-colored compound on Akademika Vargi Street in the southwest outskirts of Moscow: the headquarters of the FSB's Criminalistics Institute. The group sometimes works out of another secure compound on the eastern edge of Moscow. The official in direct command of the unit is Stanislav Makshakov. He held the rank of colonel when he worked at the Shikhany Institute near Saratov in southwest Russia, according to others who worked there. It was there that the nerve agent Novichok was developed in the 1970s and produced over the next two decades. Makshakov also holds a patent relating to mustard gas, according to public records. While Navalny may never have seen his shadows, this investigation found that other parts of their tradecraft were not that elaborate. Until 2018, agents in the unit frequently used their own names as they followed their target. Some then adopted fake identities but used their wives' maiden names and changed their dates of birth by a year. That lax approach to spy craft, as well as official corruption and poor data protection, have caused major embarrassment to Russian intelligence services before. Leaked databases from government registries are widely available in Russia for everything from vehicle registrations, passport details and other personal data. Bellingcat researchers and Russian investigative journalists have used such data to reveal details about the activities of Russian hackers and intelligence operatives, who have often made basic errors such as registering their cars to their official workplaces. Calls to Kremlin and a vacation sickness Cell phone data shows that, in the weeks before Navalny's poisoning, Makshakov and Maj. Gen. Vladimir Bogdanov, commander of the Center for Special Equipment at the FSB, communicated regularly with specialists researching nerve agents. Bogdanov is a very senior figure at the FSB. Cell phone data shows he was also in touch with a senior Kremlin official and confidante of Putin on July 2. The very next day, Navalny and his wife, Yulia, began a brief vacation at a hotel near Kaliningrad, a Russian province sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic Sea. Flight manifests obtained by the investigation show at least three members of the FSB unit flew to Kaliningrad at the same time. Security cameras at the hotel were turned off for the duration of their stay, a source has told Bellingcat. On July 6, hours after the FSB team returned to Moscow, Yulia fell ill. Navalny told CNN that she described a sense of sudden exhaustion and disorientation. Yulia recovered and the exact cause of her illness was not determined. Experts have told CNN that such symptoms are consistent with a low dosage of poisoning. And looking back, Navalny believes the symptoms were ""absolutely the same"" as those he would suffer weeks later. ""I couldn't connect these dots. Now I realize how bad she was, what it was, the kind of terrible, terrible feeling she experienced at this time."" After the Kaliningrad trip, the cell phone data of at least two dozen Russian officials show a surge in communications. Among those in contact were leaders of the FSB unit at the Akademika Vargi Street compound, scientific institutes and senior FSB officials. At the center of the web was the Signal Institute in Moscow, previously identified as at the heart of Russia's illicit and secret program to develop Novichok. Its head, Artur Zhirov, was in regular contact with officers running the FSB team, including Makshakov. Zhirov was also in contact with a St. Petersburg scientist, Sergey Chepur, who had close contacts with the Russian military intelligence (GRU) team that carried out the Novichok attack on the Skripals, who both survived. Amid this flurry of activity were at least two trips by members of the FSB unit to the Black Sea resort of Sochi, where the Russian leadership spends much of the summer. Both trips were booked on short notice, according to flight manifests. The second, which lasted just a few hours, was the day before Navalny was poisoned in the city of Tomsk. While Bellingcat and CNN cannot identify whom the travelers met in Sochi, the trip suggests that the Tomsk operation may have been approved at the highest levels. Navalny double-teamed in Siberia The investigation has found that two teams comprising five or six agents were deployed on Navalny's Siberian trip. Cell phone data shows that Pevchikh, the senior aide to Navalny, was under surveillance at her hotel in Novosibirsk, where the Navalny team planned to film an anti-corruption investigation. Navalny has focused on exposing corruption among the Russian hierarchy and oligarchs since being denied the opportunity to run against Putin in the 2018 presidential election, and encouraged tactical voting in regional elections against the governing United Russia party. After tracking Pevchikh and then Navalny to the airport in Moscow, agent Tayakin remained at the Akademika Vargi Street headquarters day and night for the duration of Navalny's six-day Siberia trip, communicating constantly with the teams in the field and apparently napping at the office when he could. From Novosibirsk, the Navalny team drove to the city of Tomsk to meet opposition activists. On the night of August 19, there is one ping from a phone belonging to Alexei Alexandrov, a 39-year-old FSB operative, who was one of the toxins team. The ping came from just a few blocks north of the Xander Hotel, where the Navalny team was staying. A new variant of Novichok Navalny doesn't know how he was poisoned that night. He told CNN that in the hotel's Velvet bar -- at around 11 p.m. -- he'd taken one taste of a cocktail, ""which was really, really bad. And I sip a couple of times and just put it on the table and go back to my room."" That might have been the source. Equally, it could have been added to laundry he had done at the hotel, placed on a towel or pillow case or injected into a shampoo bottle. Experts in nerve agents say the assailants deployed a previously unused variant of Novichok, likely A242 or A262. They can be spread in a solid form and are highly toxic. Depending on the dosage and how it's administered, Novichok can take up to 12 hours to impact the nervous system, according to experts in toxicology. Short of injecting exactly the right dose into someone, it is almost impossible for the perpetrator to dose Novichok so as to incapacitate rather than kill. Alarms raised in cockpit and in Moscow Early the next morning, Navalny left for the four-hour flight back to Moscow.

Sweating profusely, he went to the plane's bathroom. ""I went over to the flight attendant and said, 'I was poisoned, I'm going to die.' And then I laid down under his feet to die, you knew in that moment the worst,"" he said.

2020-10-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/politics/russian-nationals-charged-justice-department/index.html,6 Russian military officers charged with a worldwide cyberattack,"Six Russian military officers have been charged in what the Justice Department says was a hacking scheme to attack several major foreign powers, former Soviet republics and subvert investigations into nefarious activities by the Kremlin. The alleged cyberattackers hacked into software using destructive malware to black out thousands of computers and cause nearly $1 billion in losses, and were intended to support Russian government efforts to undermine, retaliate against, or otherwise destabilize worldwide computer networks, the Justice Department said. The alleged hackers are officers of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), a military intelligence agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Monday's charges allege some of the most consequential political attacks levied by the Kremlin since its efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election, including the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts. Prosecutors said they attacked Ukraine; the country of Georgia; elections in France; efforts to hold Russia accountable for its use of a weapons-grade nerve agent, Novichok, on foreign soil; and the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games after Russian athletes were banned from participating under their nation's flag, as a consequence of Russian government-sponsored doping effort. The United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania issued a federal arrest warrant for each of these defendants upon the grand jury's return of the indictment. ""The defendants' and their co-conspirators caused damage and disruption to computer networks worldwide, including in France, Georgia, the Netherlands, Republic of Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States,"" prosecutors said. They are all charged in seven counts: conspiracy to conduct computer fraud and abuse, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, damaging protected computers, and aggravated identity theft. One of the pieces of malware developed by the hackers took down the medical systems of Heritage Valley in Pennsylvania, prosecutors said. From November 2015 to October 2019, ""their computer attacks used some of the world's most destructive malware to date, including: KillDisk and Industroyer, which each caused blackouts in Ukraine; NotPetya, which caused nearly $1 billion in losses to the three victims identified in the indictment alone; and Olympic Destroyer, which disrupted thousands of computers used to support the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics,"" prosecutors said. The NotPetya malware, for example, spread worldwide, damaged computers used in critical infrastructure, and caused enormous financial losses. Those losses were only part of the harm, however. For example, the NotPetya malware impaired Heritage Valley's provision of critical medical services to citizens of the Western District of Pennsylvania through its two hospitals, 60 offices, and 18 community satellite facilities. The attack caused the unavailability of patient lists, patient history, physical examination files, and laboratory records. Heritage Valley lost access to its mission-critical computer systems (such as those relating to cardiology, nuclear medicine, radiology, and surgery) for approximately one week and administrative computer systems for almost one month, thereby causing a threat to public health and safety. Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko, 32; Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov, 35; Pavel Valeryevich Frolov, 28; Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, 29; Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko, 27; and Petr Nikolayevich Pliskin, 32, face a maximum sentence of 27 years in prison for wire fraud. They are wanted and assumed to be in Russia. Prosecutors said Kovalev allegedly developed ""spearphishing techniques and messages"" to target: En Marche! officials; employees of the DSTL; members of the IOC and Olympic athletes; and employees of a Georgian media entity."" ""The victims who suffered real harm, as a result of these crimes are often ordinary citizens and businesses around the world,"" US Attorney Scott W. Brady said at a Monday news conference. The malware attacks disrupted the supply of electricity to more than 225,000 Ukrainian customers during the cold winter months of December 2015, according to the indictment. When Ukraine was preparing their end of year pension payments, as well as the following year's budget, there was a destructive malware attack against Ukraine's Ministry of Finance and their state security service. During this attack, the conspirators used an updated version of KillDisk malware in December 2016, that caused the network to go down and prevented the execution of approximately 150,000 electronic payment transactions, according to the indictment. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the charges ""highlight once again Russia's continuing disruptive, destructive, and destabilizing activities in cyberspace."" ""We call on Russia to put an end to its irresponsible behavior. Furthermore, we call upon all states that wish to see greater stability in cyberspace to join us in helping bring the actors charged today to justice,"" he said in a statement. The new indictments were the latest attempt by the US to crack down on the Russian intelligence agency known as the GRU, which was responsible for interfering in the 2016 election. GRU hackers stole tens of thousands of emails from top Democrats and weaponized material through WikiLeaks releases during the 2016 campaign, helping Donald Trump and weakening Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Kovalev and 11 other GRU operatives were charged in 2018 with conspiring to hack the Democratic National Committee and Clinton's campaign chairman. The charges were brought by special counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation provided the most detailed account of how GRU hackers aggressively went after Western targets. Kovalev has yet to face a judge in Washington, DC, for the outstanding charges. ""For this type of activity, they might be safe now. In the future, they're gonna have to be looking over their shoulders,"" said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich.

2020-08-22,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/22/europe/europe-us-troop-movement-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,Trump's planned troop pullout from Germany has many military holes,"When United States and Polish officials signed a deal to support more combat troops in Poland, the country's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, said the move put American troops where they needed to be. ""The presence of American troops in Poland enhances our deterrence potential because we are closer to the potential source of conflict,"" Czaputowicz said in a joint appearance Saturday with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""It is important that they should be deployed in Poland, and not in Germany,"" Poland's top diplomat said. ""The art of war assures us that the capability of deterrence is higher if the army is deployed in the right place."" The boost for Poland is part of a Trump administration plan to pull some 12,000 US troops from Germany announced last month. While 1,000 of those will join 4,500 US troops already in Poland, others will move to Belgium or Italy or back to the US, available to be sent back to Europe or other world hotspots should the need arise. For decades, US personnel stationed in Germany have been viewed on both sides of the Atlantic as the foundation of the post-World War II order. At the height of the Cold War, the US maintained up to 400,000 troops in Europe, the majority in Germany. As was the case in decades past, the potential source of conflict remains Russia -- and the threat of possible incursion, as alluded to by Czaputowicz. However, elected officials in the US and among its NATO allies said the move to reposition troops could actually benefit Moscow. Republican US Sen. Mitt Romney last month called the plan ""a grave error"" and ""a gift to Russia."" The head of the German Parliament's foreign relations committee, Norbert Roettgen, tweeted: ""Instead of strengthening #NATO it is going to weaken the alliance. The US's military clout will not increase, but decrease in relation to Russia and the Near & Middle East."" How could that ""military clout"" decrease? Deterrence is one example. The last large US reduction of its troop presence in Germany occurred in 2012. Two years later, Russian troops moved into the Crimea and Moscow annexed the Ukrainian territory, spiking tensions with NATO. US and European military experts tell CNN the new troop reduction plan would provide few benefits on any potential future battlefield, and certainly not enough to justify its enormous cost, estimated to be in the billions of dollars. Specifically, the Trump administration plan pulls 11,900 troops from Germany, redeploying 5,400 of those elsewhere in Europe and sending the remaining ones back to the US with some of them rotating back to Europe at some point. Key movements include command and control centers going from Germany to Belgium as well as Army airborne troops and Air Force F-16 fighters moving from Germany to Italy. Where is the right place for US troops? Nick Reynolds, a land warfare research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, doesn't see much benefit from the US plans. ""Moving ground troops to Belgium and Italy puts them farther away from areas in which they are likely to be needed,"" Reynolds said. ""Even if they went to northern Italy, and a crisis happened to occur in southeastern Europe, transport links would make moving them slightly more time consuming."" Consider where the possible flashpoints are. In a paper written earlier this year, before the troop movements were announced, Iulia-Sabina Joja, a post-doctoral fellow at the Foreign Policy Institute of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, painted three scenarios that involve conflict around the Black Sea, including new flareups with Ukraine near the Crimea. Getting ground forces in numbers to those spots from Italy means getting them through the mountains of the Alps, which would not be in the way of a move from Germany. Even though Poland is closer to Russia, the potential Black Sea hotspots and another possible flashpoint along the border with the NATO allies in the Baltics, boosting troops in that country isn't necessarily the answer, Reynolds said. ""If ground troops were moved to Poland then they would potentially be able to get to where they were needed faster, though they also start (depending where they are in Poland) to become vulnerable in the (unlikely) event of a Russian offensive that achieves operational surprise,"" Reynolds said. Bastian Giegerich, director of defense and military analysis at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, questioned the effectiveness of rotating troops back into Europe from the United States. ""Aside from being expensive, troops on rotational deployment will struggle to develop a similar degree of local knowledge and links to host nation armed forces,"" Giegerich said. And while rotational deployments would give the Pentagon some flexibility to respond to hotspots worldwide, there is a price to be paid in the European theater: Fewer boots on the ground mean less deterrence than if they were there, Giegerich said. ""It is a fine balance to strike -- the ability to respond to contingencies around the globe with a bigger strategic reserve pool in the US might make it somewhat more likely that those contingencies arise in the first place,"" he said. Retired US Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, now a CNN military analyst, has years of military experience in Europe, beginning in 1975 and continuing intermittently until 2011. ""Germany is key, because it is central to both the 'old Europe' to the west and the newer states to the east,"" Hertling said. ""The rail and airports are terrific in Germany, and given its centralized position and ease in dealing with the government of Germany, we could fly anywhere, as well as bring allies into the training center at Grafenwoehr,"" he said. The Trump administration's German pullout sacrifices those efficiencies, Hertling said. ""The POTUS saying he's going to put forces into Italy and Belgium makes no sense. Italy is south of the Alps, with challenges in the government, and Belgium is west -- farther away from the eastern block of nations."" And then there's the cost. Hertling points out the US military has spent billions over the years to make Germany its central location in Europe. Pulling out of those bases means spending money on new infrastructure that's already been paid for in Germany. Numbers vs. location But where US troops are in Europe may be missing a bigger point, said Reynolds, the RUSI analyst. ""What is a more important issue is that the US does not keep adequate forces in Europe if the intention is to be able to quickly respond to a contingency involving Russian aggression,"" he said. And the NATO allies can't do the job alone. ""NATO forces are also working with too few units compared to the size of Russian forces that they would potentially face, at least until larger and heavier US forces could arrive from the continental US,"" Reynolds said. The Trump administration's pullout from Germany doesn't address another US/NATO deficiency in Europe -- it doesn't have enough runways that can handle alliance fighter aircraft. ""This is absolutely the issue that NATO faces in the air domain with being unable to adequately disperse its aircraft -- particularly fighter and strike aircraft, which need longer and better-reinforced runways -- to avoid having them concentrated on a few airfields that are therefore easier to target with long-range precision fires, either destroying the aircraft on the ground or negating their ability to use airfields by rendering the runway unserviceable,"" Reynolds said. In any event, the plan would take years execute and Congress would have to find the billions of dollars needed to make it happen. And with a US election less than three months away, new thinking could emerge with a possible new occupant of the White House. The Germany pullout is far from a done deal.",29,4.021874680601411,3.5584732873692664,0.4634013932321448,25
2020-07-11,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/10/politics/donald-trump-us-russia-cyberattack/index.html,Trump confirms US conducted cyberattack against Russia in 2018,"President Donald Trump, for the first time, confirmed the US conducted a covert cyberattack in 2018 against Russia's Internet Research Agency. The Internet Research Agency is a troll farm blamed by the US for helping to facilitate interference both in the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterms. Trump gave the confirmation during an interview conducted by Marc Thiessen, a Washington Post columnist and former speechwriter for President George W. Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Thiessen writes in the Post that during his interview he asked Trump whether he had launched a cyberattack. Thiessen said Trump replied, ""Correct."" Trump said during the interview that in 2016, then-President Barack Obama ""knew before the election that Russia was playing around. Or, he was told. Whether or not it was so or not, who knows? And he said nothing. And the reason he said nothing was that he didn't want to touch it because he thought (Hillary Clinton) was winning because he read phony polls. So, he thought she was going to win. And we had the silent majority that said, 'No, we like Trump.' "" Trump claimed that unlike his predecessor, he acted on intelligence the US had about Russia's election interference by launching the cyberattack. ""Look, we stopped it,"" Trump told Thiessen. Obama in December 2016 did announce sanctions against Russia and expelled some Russian diplomats in retaliation for Russia's interference in the US presidential election. The Washington Post in October 2018 previously reported there was a cyberattack. The operation against the company, which is bankrolled by an oligarch close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was carried out in order to prevent any interference in the midterms, the paper was told. This is, however, the first official confirmation from Trump. Thiessen reports senior US officials also confirmed that the strike occurred and was effective, taking the Internet Research Agency offline. In the interview, Trump said the cyberattack was part of a broader policy to confront Russia. ""Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,"" the President told Thiessen, a contention he has made repeatedly in the past. Among the examples he gave was the US sending antitank busters to Ukraine. As CNN previously reported, Trump appeared to confirm that the US had conducted such a cyberattack against a Russian entity during the 2018 midterm elections in a June 2019 Fox News interview. ""I would rather not say that, but you can believe that the whole thing happened, and it happened during my administration,"" Trump told Fox News' Steve Hilton when asked about a report that he personally authorized a cyberattack on Russia during the time of the midterms. When pressed as to why he didn't talk about it, Trump said ""because they don't like me to talk, intelligence says, 'please don't talk intelligence,' you know sometimes intelligence is good, and sometimes you look at (James) Comey, and you look at (John) Brennan and you look at (James) Clapper, and I'm supposed to believe that intelligence? I never believe that intelligence."" CNN's Barbara Starr also reported in October 2018 that the US military's Cyber Command had begun targeting Russian operatives believed to be attempting to influence the 2018 midterm elections as part of a broad effort in coordination with several government agencies, an administration official confirmed to CNN.",3,3.7342220393527215,0.9246437160869504,2.809578323265771,28
2020-06-29,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/europe/russia-afghanistan-gru-analysis-intl/index.html,Russia's GRU: Spy agency known for brazenness back in the headlines,"For an intelligence service that is supposed to operate in the shadows, the GRU seems to attract a lot of headlines. The GRU -- formally known as Main Directorate of the General Staff -- has long been accused by the West of orchestrating brazen and high-profile attacks, including the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts during the 2016 US presidential election and the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England. Now the spy agency is again at the center of international attention, after reports that US intelligence concluded GRU operatives offered cash incentives to the Taliban to kill American and British troops in Afghanistan. The news has already caused a political storm in Washington, with congressional leaders demanding answers from the Trump administration. But observers also wonder why the Russian intelligence agency would run an operation that potentially conflicts with Russia's own stated goals to bring warring parties to the table in Afghanistan and avoid a precipitous collapse of the central government. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the story -- first reported by the New York Times -- was a ""hoax,"" echoing President Donald Trump's suggestion that the reported intelligence may be ""phony"" and the story false. ""First of all, these assertions are a lie,"" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. ""Secondly, if the US special services still report to the president, then I suggest [you] proceed from the corresponding statements of President Trump, who has already given his assessment to these reports."" One can be forgiven for having a sense of déjà vu: The denials about GRU always come swiftly from the Russian government. In March 2018, then UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was ""highly likely"" responsible for the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury -- and that the two suspects in the attack were believed to be officers of the GRU. That July, the US Special Prosecutor's office indicted 12 GRU officers for their alleged involvement in the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts as part of a larger, Kremlin-directed effort to interfere in the 2016 US election campaign. The Kremlin repeatedly denied involvement in both cases, although Russian President Vladimir Putin called Skripal a ""traitor"" and a ""scumbag"" and suggested that the leak of the Democratic Party emails was not necessarily a bad thing. ""Some hackers published information about the unseemly conduct of Ms. [Hillary] Clinton's campaign headquarters -- supporting one candidate for the party nomination at the expense of the other,"" he said. ""Everyone is talking about who did it, but is it so important who did it? What is important is the content of this information. That's my answer."" Now, allegations that the GRU offered bounties to Taliban fighters to kill US troops come at a sensitive time: Russia -- which considers Afghanistan a near-neighbor -- want American troops out of the country. In late February, the US and the Taliban inked a peace deal that paves the way for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and peace talks between the militant group and the government. While relations between the US and Russia are fraught, the two countries have some common ground on Afghanistan: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova, usually a staunch critic of US foreign policy, recently praised US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad for his ""proactive efforts"" to broker peace in Afghanistan. And Russia has made its own efforts to shape outcomes in Afghanistan, bringing representatives of the Taliban and some of Afghanistan's most prominent political players to Moscow. An alleged GRU operation targeting US and coalition soldiers would appear to be at odds with those Russian diplomatic initiatives, says Laurel Miller, program director for Asia with International Crisis Group. Russia has cultivated contacts with both the Taliban and other warring parties in Afghanistan as a way to influence outcomes in a region it considers its strategic backyard. ""It's long been known that there were Russian contacts with the Taliban and at minimum some greasing of the relationship with benefits as a hedging technique,"" Miller said. Back in 2017, for instance, Army Gen. John Nicholson, the top US commander said publicly Russia was sending weapons to the Taliban via neighboring Tajikistan. However, she said that an operation to put bounties on US troops would be far more provocative and a ""different thing"" from its typical behavior. ""It conflicts with what Russian official policy is,"" she said. In other words, the alleged GRU operation targeting US and coalition troops could have blowback: potentially undermining US support for withdrawal, or perhaps prompting fresh sanctions on Russia. But the agency does have a reputation for brazenness -- and can operate seemingly opportunistically or independently of official policy. Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, points out that the GRU does aggressively pursue operations that cause diplomatic fallout. Intelligence experts say the Salisbury poisoning -- which led to the investigative outlet Bellingcat unmasking the alleged GRU operatives through open-source research -- showed a pattern recklessness and overt brutality, rather than a secretive approach to spycraft, that sent a message to the GRU's enemies. ""That was a pattern we've seen many times in Ukraine,"" he said, referring to Russian intelligence activities there. ""The Kremlin is hardly a well-oiled machine, but time and again, Putin -- either by denying blatant Russian misdeeds or throwing a safety blanket over his security establishment -- does little to improve Russia's international image."" And Putin has shown consistent willingness to give political cover to the GRU. Just a few months after the Salisbury poisonings, which prompted the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats from the West, Putin took part in a gala event to celebrate the centenary of what he called the ""legendary GRU"" and praised the patriotism of its officers, who work for an organization that no longer has ""intelligence"" in its name. ""It is unclear where the name Main Intelligence Directorate has gone,"" he said. ""We ought to restore it.""",3,1.816573981297365,5.023286744185842,-3.2067127628884773,3

At a White House roundtable Monday, Trump said the current number of troops in Germany is ""a tremendous cost to the United States"" and suggested he would pull some troops out of Germany unless the nation pays more to NATO. ""And Germany, as you know, is very delinquent in their payments to NATO,"" he told reporters, claiming later, ""So Germany is delinquent, they've been delinquent for years and they owe NATO billions of dollars, and they have to pay it. So we're protecting Germany and they're delinquent, that doesn't make sense."" Trump has repeatedly mischaracterized Germany's payments to NATO. It is not in debt to the alliance and never has been, but is not meeting a pledge to spend 2% of its GDP on national defense, the same as many other members. Germany has recently been increasing its defense spending. Trump said he would draw down the number of US soldiers in Germany to 25,000 troops. There are approximately 34,000 US troops stationed in Germany. CNN previously reported that the exact size of the reduction has not been decided, but a cut of 9,500 is the current tentative planning figure. ""One of the only countries that hasn't agreed to pay what they're supposed to pay (on NATO) is Germany. So, I said until they pay, we're removing our soldiers, a number of our soldiers, by about half. Then when we get down to about 25,000, we'll see where we're going,"" Trump said. The President also accused Germany of treating the US ""very badly on trade."" ""So, Germany takes and then on top of that they treat us very badly on trade,"" Trump said, adding, ""And we're negotiating with them on that, but right now I'm not satisfied with the deal they want to make. They've cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars over the years on trade."" Trump has long criticized Germany over a range of issues, particularly Berlin's failure to meet the target of 2% of gross domestic product spending on defense that is recommended by NATO. In 2014, following Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, all NATO members pledged to meet the 2% target by 2024. Only nine of the 29 NATO allies are currently estimated to reach that recommended spending target of 2% of GDP. If the troops directed to leave Germany are removed from Europe entirely, the drawdown could be seen as a major blow to solidarity within the NATO alliance as many member countries continue to express concerns about the threat posed by Russia, which has used military force against Ukraine in recent years. Nearly two-dozen Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee in a letter last week urged Trump not to significantly reduce the number of US forces in Germany, arguing that it would encourage Russian aggression and hurt military readiness. During a news conference Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he told Trump last week that the US presence in Europe is ""good for Europe, but it's also good for North America and the United States, because the transatlantic bond is essential to the strength and the success of the alliance."" ""My message to (Trump) has been that NATO allies are actually delivering. We have seen, now several years, with increased defense spending across the alliance,"" Stoltenberg said later, adding, ""But we still have way to go to meet the 2% guideline."" He said that the US had not yet decided ""how and when this decision will be implemented"" but that he expects the issue will be discussed in the NATO defense ministers' meeting this week. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also said Tuesday he believes the US military presence in Germany is important for Europe and the US. ""We believe that the American presence in Germany is important not only for the security of Germany, but also for the security of the United States and for the security of Europe as a whole,"" Maas said during a visit to Warsaw, Poland.",29,2.8209808220398056,0.7395771663868567,2.0814036556529487,2

The official said that the exact size of the reduction has not been decided but a cut of 9,500 is the current tentative planning figure. The formal order to begin moving troops has yet to be given but is expected soon. There are approximately 34,000 US troops stationed in Germany. A spokesman for the Pentagon referred CNN to the National Security Council, which has not responded to the request for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the expected drawdown. President Donald Trump has long criticized Germany over a range of issues, particularly Berlin's failure to meet the target of 2% of GDP spending on defense that is recommended by NATO. While defense officials had weighed moving some forces from Germany in the past, several US and NATO officials told CNN that the size and timing of the reduction were unexpected. NATO referred questions about the reduction to the US government. The US military has stationed forces in Germany since the end of the Second World War and their presence there on the front lines of the Cold War helped deter the Soviet Union from mounting an attack on NATO members. While the number of US troops in Germany had decreased in recent years, US bases in the country continue to be used by the military due to their strategic location and the presence of US defense infrastructure such as air bases and medical facilities. Withdrawal would be a blow to NATO If the troops directed to leave Germany are removed from Europe entirely, the drawdown could be seen as a major blow to solidarity within the NATO alliance as many member countries continue to express concerns about the threat posed by Russia, which has used military force against Ukraine in recent years. The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee slammed news of the planned drawdown, calling it ""petty and preposterous"" and a ""favor"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""This order is petty and preposterous. It's another favor to Putin and another leadership failure by this administration that further strains relations with our allies,"" Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told CNN in a statement. Many European allies have openly questioned Trump's commitment to NATO which he labeled obsolete during his campaign for the presidency. While Trump has since changed his tone, claiming credit for a member countries boosting their defense spending, he has continued to slam Germany. While NATO officials have said that Trump's pressure has contributed to the growth in defense spending, they had also previously pointed to an increase in US military forces in Europe as indicative of Washington's continued commitment to the alliance, a narrative that a major reduction from Germany could undermine. Germany recently agreed to pay a greater share of NATO's direct budget, allowing the US to reduce its contribution. It is possible that any troops removed from Germany could be repositioned in Poland as Warsaw has long sought an increase in the number of US personnel stationed there, with Poland's President offering to name a new US Base in Poland Ft. Trump. Senior Trump administration officials have in the past suggested moving US troops from Germany to Poland due to Berlin's failure to meet the 2% target. ""Poland meets its 2% of GDP spending obligation towards NATO. Germany does not. We would welcome American troops in Germany to come to Poland,"" the US ambassador to Poland, Georgette Mosbacher, wrote on Twitter in August.

""Russia didn't adhere to the treaty, so until they adhere, we will pull out,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House Thursday.

""No, I think that we're going to have (a) very good relationship with Russia,"" the President said. The 1992 treaty allows member countries to conduct short-notice, unarmed, reconnaissance flights over the other countries to collect data on their military forces and activities. It is the latest major arms control treaty that the US will abandon under the Trump administration. Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the Trump administration is ""committed to our treaty obligations, but in this era of great power competition we are looking to advocate for agreements that benefit all sides and that include partners who comply responsibly with their obligations."" The Open Skies Treaty is part of a broad web of arms control agreements meant to ensure stability and predictability on the European continent and reduce the risk of misunderstandings that could spiral into conflict by ensuring transparency. Bipartisan groups of former national security officials reacted with dismay to the news the US will withdraw, saying that will reduce US leadership in the world, hand Russia a victory and undermine US and global security. 'This is insane' ""This is insane,"" tweeted Gen. Michael Hayden, the retired four-star general who served as former National Security Agency director, a former principal deputy director of national intelligence and was President George W. Bush's director of the CIA. The New York Times was first to report a final decision has been reached. European allies, who have lobbied for the US to remain in the treaty, see it as a central part of their security infrastructure and the US decision to withdraw will likely add to the strain in transatlantic relations, analysts say. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a nearly 1,000-word statement explaining the decision that the US understands Europeans still value the treaty. ""If not for the value they place on the OST, we would likely have exited long ago. We are not willing, however, to perpetuate the Treaty's current problems of Russian-engendered threat and distrust simply in order to maintain an empty façade of cooperation with Moscow."" Pompeo said the US would fully exit the treaty in six months, adding that ""we may, however, reconsider our withdrawal should Russia return to full compliance with the Treaty."" Christopher Ford, the assistant secretary for international security and nonproliferation, did not describe what benchmarks the Russians would need to meet before the US would consider them back in compliance. ""That's a fact pattern we'll have to deal with when we encounter it,"" he said on a call with reporters. The President, and many officials in his administration, are pushing to develop new nuclear weapons, even as they insist they are not starting a new arms race with Russia. At the same time, they have criticized the idea that the United States should be bound by international agreements. But analysts and former officials say discarding another agreement could deepen global instability. Former President Ronald Reagan's secretary of state, George Shultz, former President George H.W. Bush's secretary of defense William Perry, and former Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn -- who together with Henry Kissinger formed the Nuclear Security Project -- wrote the administration in March to urge they keep the Open Skies Treaty. In a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Pompeo, Trump and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, they wrote that ""at a time when tensions with Moscow are on the rise, the Open Skies Treaty serves as a very useful tool for the United States and our allies to monitor Russian military activities. Unilateral US withdrawal from Open Skies would undermine American allies and friends in Europe."" The Trump administration has already pulled out of an Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and has set out conditions to renew the last remaining nuclear arms pact with Russia -- the NEW Start Treaty -- that experts and analysts say all but guarantee it will not be extended. The Open Skies Treaty is part of ""a set of reinforcing documents which create stability and predictability in and around Europe,"" said Jon Wolfsthal, director of the Nuclear Crisis Group at Global Zero. ""Trump and his advisers have been systematically destroying those agreements in part because of Russian noncompliance, but when you look at the Trump approach, it's 'tear it down and don't put anything in its place and at times, make it harder for people to put anything else in its place.'"" ""This is about the overall neglect of a proven tool of securing American and allied interests,"" Wolfsthal said. The US has accused Russia of not complying with the treaty. In early March, Amb. Jim Gilmore, the US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said that the administration was seeking ""reciprocity"" from Moscow on the agreement. ""We think that we have to be holding the Russians strictly to account on the Open Skies Treaty,"" he said. ""The President's policy is that in all treaties that there needs to be reciprocity. If we're going to adhere strictly to these -- to our treaty obligations, we expect the Russians to hold strictly to their treaty obligations."" On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Hoffman reiterated US accusations that Moscow has imposed restrictions on fights near its exclave of Kaliningrad, an area between Poland and Lithuania where the Russian military maintains a robust presence. He also accused Russia of denying flights ""within 10 kilometers of the Georgia-Russia border, and denying a flight over major military exercises the past year which completely prevented imaging of military exercise activity that was scheduled and approved previously."" ""Russia flagrantly and continuously violates its obligations under Open Skies and implements the treaty in ways that contribute to military threats against the United States and our allies and partners,"" Hoffman told reporters. Russian non-compliance Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said the dispute about overflights near Kaliningrad does not warrant abandoning the agreement. ""Concerns about Russian compliance with the accord, though serious, are resolvable, pertain to political disputes between Russia and some of its neighbors, and do not rise to the level of a material breach that would merit US withdrawal from the treaty,"" Kimball said. He pointed out that even though Russia has imposed a 500 kilometer flight limit over Kaliningrad in contravention of the treaty, ""a treaty flight by Estonia, Lithuania, and the United States in February over Kaliningrad flew for more than 500 kilometers for the first time since Moscow imposed the sublimit in 2014, according to an April 8 report in the Russian newspaper Kommersant."" According to the State Department, the treaty ""is designed to enhance mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information through aerial imaging on military forces and activities of concern to them."" Treaty members who overfly other countries in the pact must first have their airplanes thoroughly inspected, analysts and experts explain. For example, Russian planes that fly over the US have to be examined by Americans, US intelligence agencies and other treaty members. American inspectors take pictures of the plane, seal its compartments and then seal the plane itself up and put tags put on it, so that none of the technical equipment used for photographing can be altered. Once a plane is certified by inspectors, only then is it allowed to fly. After its flight, all the information and photographs gathered by that plane have to be shared with all other treaty members to ensure transparency. ""In every instance when Russia flies over us we get that information,"" Wolfsthal said. Photographs can only be taken at a determined number of pixels per square inch ""to ensure they can't be expanded, can't zoom in anymore,"" Wolfsthal said. Trump signed a document signaling his intent to withdraw last year, according to people familiar with the decision. European nations, including Ukraine, have pushed to preserve the treaty, seeing it as an integral to their national security. Some analysts say the treaty, which was designed to boost confidence that countries aren't planning an attack, was a driving factor in the Russian decision to invade Ukraine with a smaller military force that would be less noticeable from the air. European nations say any disputes over Russian compliance should be addressed through negotiations. Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, a longtime skeptic of arms-control agreements, and his allies within the administration have challenged Russia's claims of compliance. Before he left his post, he urged Trump to sign the document signaling the US intention to withdraw, two of the US officials said.

2020-01-31,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/politics/trump-landmines-loosened/index.html,Trump loosens restrictions on use of landmines,"President Donald Trump rescinded restrictions on the US military's ability to use landmines, weapons that have been banned by more than 160 countries due to their history of killing and wounding civilians, the White House said Friday. ""The President has canceled the Obama administration's policy to prohibit United States military forces from employing anti-personnel landmines outside of the Korean Peninsula,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. ""The Department of Defense has determined that restrictions imposed on American forces by the Obama Administration's policy could place them at a severe disadvantage during a conflict against our adversaries. The President is unwilling to accept this risk to our troops,"" she added. CNN reported Thursday that the move was expected and came about following a lengthy Pentagon review. The policy represents a major reversal from the approach of the Obama administration which in 2014 committed the US to largely adhering to the 1997 Ottawa Convention, the international agreement which banned the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. The Obama policy committed to replacing landmines in the US stockpile after they expire and directed the destruction of stockpiles not required for the defense of South Korea. Anti-landmine campaigners were quick to criticize the new policy after news of the change broke. ""Mr. Trump's policy rollback is a step toward the past, like many of his other decisions, and sends exactly the wrong message to those working to rid the world of the scourge of landmines,"" Jody Williams, who received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize together with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, said in a statement Thursday. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper defended the new policy prior to it being formally announced. ""I think landmines are -- are an important tool that our forces need to have available to them in order to ensure mission success, and in order to reduce risk to forces. That said, in everything we do, we also want to make sure that these instruments, in this case landmines, also take into account both the safety of employment, and the safety to civilians and others after a conflict,"" Esper told reporters at the Pentagon Friday. The new Department of Defense landmine policy will permit the operational use of landmines only if they have a 30-day self-destruction or self-deactivation feature, a design feature seen as helping to prevent civilian casualties. Speaking to reporters on Friday Victorino Mercado, who is performing the duties of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities, acknowledged that landmines were ""an emotional"" issue but stressed that the US would only use landmines with these safety features, noting that China and Russia maintain a stockpile of thousands of persistent landmines that are seen as much more likely to kill or maim civilians. The new Pentagon policy gives the authority to use landmines in combat to the commanders of the US military's combatant commands, usually a four-star general or admiral, such as the commanders of US Africa Command and US Central Command which oversee operations on the African continent and the Middle East respectively. Defense officials argue that landmines can play an important role in defending US forces from both enemy armored vehicles and ground forces, helping to ensure US forces are not outflanked or overrun during an attack and can help influence the enemy's direction of movement in a manner to give US troops the advantage. One of the drivers of the change in policy is greater concern about the prospect of a major conflict with a ""great power"" adversary like Russia or China where denying conventional enemy forces access to critical terrain would be seen as a more urgent need than it has been in recent years where the US has focused on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations. Moscow and Beijing are not parties to the Ottawa treaty. Mercado said that the growing challenge of Russia and China meant that ""the strategic environment has changed since"" the Obama administration instituted its policy in 2014. Russian troops occupied Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine in 2014 sparking new concerns about the threat posed by Moscow to NATO's eastern flank where the US has relatively few military forces. ""You can take a situation where in the early stages we could be extremely outnumbered and by adding this capability and to be able to shape that battle space, that's an enormous equalizer and that could allow more (US) forces to flow in,"" Mercado said. ""We can create areas for the enemy to avoid,"" Mercado said, later adding that just the threat of potential landmines having been emplaced could affect an adversary's calculus without the US having to actually lay any mines. He said he does not envision landmines being used in current military operations in places like Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, saying, ""I don't see that right now.""",14,2.554209847388891,1.8126120322572499,0.7415978151316409,25
2019-11-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/27/politics/trump-nato-contribution-nato/index.html,Trump administration to cut its financial contribution to NATO,"The Trump administration has moved to substantially cut its contribution to NATO's collective budget according to several US and NATO officials, a symbolic move that comes as many continue to question President Donald Trump's commitment to the transatlantic alliance as he prepares to attend a summit to mark its 70th anniversary in London next week. Previously the US provided some 22% of NATO's direct funding, which covers the cost of maintaining the NATO headquarters, joint security investments and some combined military operations. It's a largely symbolic move as NATO's direct budget is relatively small, at about $2.5 billion, and is separate from national defense budgets that NATO recommends should stand at 2% of GDP. US defense officials tell CNN that the Trump administration sought to reduce its contribution to about 16%, bringing it in line with Germany's, which provides 14.8% despite the US having a larger economy. US and NATO officials told CNN that the other NATO members are expected to make up the shortfall. Trump has long slammed NATO allies, particularly Germany for not meeting the 2% NATO defense spending target, which only eight of 29 members currently meet. All members pledged to reach the 2% level by 2024 but not all of them currently have plans to do so. Member countries have boosted defense spending considerably in recent years, something Trump has claimed credit for. NATO officials including the Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have also credited Trump for the rise in spending, with an extra $100 billion spent since 2014 but have also acknowledged the increased threat from Russia following its seizure of Crimea and other factors have helped to prompt the increase. ""All Allies have agreed a new cost sharing formula. Under the new formula, cost shares attributed to most European Allies and Canada will go up, while the US share will come down. This is an important demonstration of Allies' commitment to the Alliance and to fairer burden-sharing,"" a NATO official told CNN. A NATO diplomat told CNN that the new formula was agreed to this week. One US defense official said that the money saved by the US will help fund other US military and security efforts in Europe, including programs in countries such as non-NATO members Ukraine and Georgia, which are seen as being on the frontline with Russia. Member countries contribute to these NATO budgets in accordance with an agreed cost-sharing formula based on gross national income. The civilian budget was set at about $260.5 million for 2019 and is used mainly to fund the NATO headquarters in Belgium and administration costs. There's a military budget of $1.56 billion for 2019, which is used to fund some joint operations and the NATO strategic command center, as well as training and research. That is a fraction of overall spending on defense by member countries, which NATO estimates will total more than $1 trillion in 2019. There is also a joint budget for the NATO Security Investment Programme, which covers major construction and command and control system investments. The budget for that program is capped at $770 million for 2019.

It is believed the White House will make the announcement soon, a US official told CNN. Here's a look at what's at involved. What is the ""Open Skies"" treaty? The treaty allows 34 countries to conduct unarmed surveillance flights over one another's territories -- including the US and Russia. It was signed in 1992 and went into effect in 2002. According to the State Department, the treaty ""is designed to enhance mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information through aerial imaging on military forces and activities of concern to them."" Why does the US want to withdraw? The White House has so far not confirmed the expected withdrawal or reasons for it. However, a State Department spokesman's comment did hint at dissatisfaction with the treaty. ""We continue to implement the treaty and are in full compliance with our obligations under this Treaty, unlike Russia,"" the spokesperson said. The US has in the past accused Moscow of imposing restrictions on flights near its exclave of Kaliningrad, an area between Poland and Lithuania where the Russian military maintains a robust presence. Who is part of the Open Skies treaty? The 34 member states are: Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, the UK, and the US. Kyrgyzstan has signed, but not ratified the treaty. What do Democrats say? Democrats have been quick to criticize the impending announcement. ""Pulling out of the Open Skies Treaty, an important multilateral arms control agreement, would be yet another gift from the Trump Administration to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" said the top Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs, House Armed Services, Senate Armed Services and Senate Foreign Relations committees, in a letter to US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""Not only is there no case for withdrawal on the grounds of national security, there has been no consultation with the Congress or with our allies about this consequential decision. Any action by this administration to withdraw from critical international treaties without the approval of the Senate is deeply concerning,"" wrote Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Rep. Eliot Engel of New York and Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state. What does Russia say? The Russian Embassy in Washington tweeted on Tuesday expressing support for the treaty, saying: ""We consider the #OpenSkiesTreaty to be an important instrument in ensuring European security on the same level as the 2011 Vienna document on confidence- and security-building measures.""",29,4.583745864982954,4.913679173422495,-0.32993330843954105,28

The return of 35 Ukranian prisoners and 35 Russian prisoners is a move that could ease tensions between the two countries after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. ""Today we can finally say safely that the mutual return of Ukrainian and Russian citizens has been conducted,"" Russian Human Rights Ombudswoman Tatyana Moskalkova said, Russian state news agency TASS reported Saturday. The Dutch Foreign Ministry said Saturday that the Russian prisoners who were released to Moscow included Volodymyr Tsemakh, who is suspected of being involved in shooting MH17 out of the sky. The Dutch Prime Minister and Foreign Minister had been in touch with their Ukrainian colleagues before the swap to tell them that sending Tsemakh to Russia would not be conducive for the MH17 investigation. As a result, the prisoner swap had been delayed to allow the Dutch Public Prosecution Service time to interrogate the suspect again in the last couple of days, a letter sent to the Dutch Parliament said, which was seen by CNN. Discussions of an exchange between the two nations had intensified after Volodymyr Zelensky was elected Ukrainian President, TASS reported. Journalist and film director among those released Among the 35 Ukrainian prisoners released and flown to Kiev were 24 sailors captured by Moscow when warships seized three naval vessels in the Kerch Strait in 2018, Ukrainian state media agency Ukrinform reported Saturday. Film director Oleg Sentsov was also released. He had been sentenced in 2015 in Russia for what the court said was terrorism in a case that drew widespread international condemnation. After landing in Kiev, the Ukrainian prisoners were seen greeting and hugging their emotional family members on the runway. ""I learned about the exchange only at 4 a.m. today,"" sailor Vyacheslav Zinchenko told reporters after landing in Kiev. He added that he was keen to go home after the long journey, but explained that he had to go to hospital with other prisoners to be ""examined."" Zelensky, who was there to greet the freed Ukrainian prisoners, hailed the exchange as the ""first step"" towards improving relations and finishing ""this horrible war"" -- referring to the conflict in eastern Ukraine with pro-Russian separatists. NATO calls for the release of all political prisoners Journalist Kirill Vyshinsky, who had been detained on charges of treason and accused of publishing ""anti-Ukrainian"" articles, was another high profile prisoner released by Ukraine to Moscow. Vyshinsky considered the accusations against him a lie and a form of manipulation, according to Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti. Before the exchange, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said it would be a ""good step forward towards the normalization"" of relations between the two nations, Reuters reported. NATO's spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said in a statement that the prisoner release was a ""step in the right direction"" and that the organization welcomed that the Ukrainian sailors and Sentsov were ""finally back home."" But she added that NATO ""continues to call on Russia to fulfill all its obligations under the Minsk Agreements, including the release of all prisoners."" Lungescu added that ""it remains important to establish the truth and accountability for the downing of flight MH17.""",13,4.239828601851337,3.387051295765476,0.8527773060858608,7
2019-08-27,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/27/politics/ron-johnson-russia-visa-denied/index.html,"GOP, Democratic senators denied visas to Russia","Two US senators have been denied visas to Russia in what appears to be a retaliatory move on the part of the Kremlin amid continued tensions between the two countries. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, and Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, were scheduled to travel as part of a congressional delegation to Russia next week. Both said their visas for the trip were rejected. A third member of the delegation, Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, did not have his visa rejected, a spokesperson told CNN. Lee still plans to go to Russia, that spokesperson said. A Senate staffer familiar with the trip said Murphy is now going to Germany and will then be joined by Johnson for stops in Kosovo, Serbia and Ukraine. Those latter three stops were part of the original itinerary, the staffer said. In a statement Tuesday, Murphy said, ""Unfortunately, the Russian government is further isolating their country by blocking our visit and several others in recent months."" ""With the collapse of recent arms control agreements and significant domestic opposition to Vladimir Putin's authoritarian rule, this is potentially a perilous moment for our two nations' fragile relationship, and it's a shame that Russia isn't interested in dialogue,"" he said. Johnson had also expressed the desire for dialogue with Russia during the trip. ""Working with Ambassador (Jon) Huntsman, I had hoped direct dialogue with Russian parliamentarians could help set the stage for better future relations between our two nations. Unfortunately, Russian officials continue to play diplomatic games with this sincere effort and have denied me entrance to Russia,"" the Wisconsin Republican said in a statement Monday. Johnson called it a ""petty affront"" but vowed to ""continue to advocate a strong and resolute response to Russian aggression — and frank dialogue when possible."" The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that Johnson is on an official list barring entry to the country, saying Tuesday he did not apply for a visa ""but presented everything as if he had been refused after applying."" In a tweet Monday, the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC, accused the Wisconsin Republican of being ""ready not for a dialogue, but a confrontation."" The Embassy called on the US ""to remove lawmakers from any travel restrictions as a first step towards the abolition of >"" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told RIA-Novosti that Johnson was on a ""stop list"" in response to measures by Washington. RIA-Novosti described Johnson as supporting ""anti-Russian"" legislation. In March 2019, Murphy and Johnson were among a group of lawmakers who introduced legislation aimed at countering Russian energy influence in Europe. Both are members of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee On Europe And Regional Security Cooperation. Other lawmakers, such as Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, have been denied entry in the past over their support for Russian sanctions legislation. Russia's decision to deny entry to the lawmakers comes amid heightened tensions between the two countries over issues including Russia's annexation of Crimea, its 2016 election interference and the attempted poisoning of an alleged Russian spy in the United Kingdom. There has also been military escalation after the US withdrew from a nuclear treaty with Russia earlier this month and tested a new non-nuclear missile, leading Russia to test fire nuclear-capable missiles near NATO's borders. In an updated statement, a US State Department spokesperson said they were of reports that the senators had been denied visas by Russian authorities. ""Per standard practice, at the request of members of Congress, the Department of State was prepared to support planned travel by Senators Johnson and Murphy to Russia, in their capacities as Members of the Europe and Regional Security Cooperation Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to discuss a wide range of issues affecting relations between the United States and Russia and to assess the prospects for a more constructive relationship, including conducting Committee oversight relating to U.S. funding and sanctions,"" the spokesperson said Tuesday. CNN has reached out to the Russian Embassy about Murphy's visa denial. In efforts to restore more normal relations with Moscow, President Donald Trump has suggested reinstating Russia into the G7 and inviting the country to the summit next year. Johnson, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, visited Russia last year along with a group of Republican senators. In 2014, Russia sanctioned a list of US officials and lawmakers, in response to the US imposing sanctions for Russia's annexation moves. In a separate incident, two US Democratic lawmakers were barred this month from entering Israel for their support of the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement, after Trump encouraged the move. Israel's decision against Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota marked a remarkable step both by Trump and his ally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to punish political opponents.",29,3.8057773106137547,4.236164623494064,-0.4303873128803093,28
2019-07-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/world/eastern-ukraine-unicef-water-report/index.html,Fighting in Ukraine threatens water supply for 3.2 million,"A recent escalation of fighting in eastern Ukraine is threatening access to safe water and sanitation for more than 3 million people, including 500,000 children, UNICEF warned on Wednesday, calling for ""an immediate end to the indiscriminate shelling of vital civilian infrastructure."" Since 2014, Ukrainian troops in the eastern Donbas region have been battling Russian-backed separatists in a bloody conflict that continues to take its toll on civilians. This year alone, the fighting has either disrupted or entirely halted the water supply for 3.2 million people, the children's rights organization said in a new statement released Wednesday. Some families living near the disputed city of Donetsk have had no running water or electricity for months, even years, according to UNICEF. Since the beginning of the year, fighting has damaged water and sanitation facilities nearly 60 times, escalating the threat of communicable diseases in an area where immunization rates are low. In 2018, water supply in eastern Ukraine was disrupted 89 times, UNICEF said in a report published in March. Fighting also limits the possibility for essential repairs, UNICEF said, adding that dozens of workers at water facilities have been injured since the start of the conflict. ""When access is cut or reduced, children and their families often have no choice but to rely on contaminated water and unsafe sanitation,"" UNICEF's Ukraine Deputy Representative, Laura Bill, said Wednesday. ""This is particularly dangerous during the stifling summer temperatures we have seen recently."" Water interruption in April caused an outbreak of gastroenteritis in the area within days, she said. One single incident damaging a water facility can disrupt water supply for an entire region, Sebastien Truffaut, Chief of UNICEF's Water and Sanitation Program in Ukraine, told CNN. ""It brings a lot of concerns for us because if bad luck reaches one of the main water facilities, the water supplies for 300,000 - 500,000 people could be stopped,"" he said. On June 29, shrapnel from exploding shells damaged water pipelines near the town of Horlivka, along the Siversky Donets-Donbas channel, which supplies water to more than 3 million people on both sides of the contact line, UNICEF said. In another incident, workers at a pumping station near Vasylivka had to run to a bomb shelter to escape the shelling, UNICEF said. Toll on children Children under the age of 15 living in areas of protracted military conflicts are about three times more likely to die from diseases caused by a lack of safe water, sanitation and hygiene than by direct violence, according to UNICEF figures published earlier this year based on mortality rates in 16 countries with protracted conflict. Those countries include Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In Ukraine, over 54,000 children live on the government-controlled side within 9 miles (15km) of the direct line of contact between the two warring sides, according to the latest UNICEF numbers. In addition to limited access to clean water, children living in those areas are also facing numerous daily ceasefire violations, the presence of unexploded mines, limited or no access to healthcare, education or transportation, sexual exploitation, neglect at home and deepening poverty, according to the UNICEF report published in March. Those hazards continue to endanger the physical and psychological wellbeing of children living in conflict areas, UNICEF said. The fighting still has no end in sight As the conflict enters its fifth year, there is still no tangible prospect for peace. The Normandy format talks between Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany haven't delivered significant results. The crisis began after then President Viktor Yanukovych suspended trade deal talks with the EU and sided with Russia. Tens of thousands took to the streets in the following days, with tensions reaching a boiling point when dozens of people died in Maidan (Independence) Square in central Kiev during a gunfight between protesters and police. In the following weeks, Russia sent military forces into Crimea, eventually annexing the Black Sea peninsula following a referendum that Ukraine and most western countries slam as illegitimate. Soon after, Ukrainian government forces were sent to eastern Ukraine to confront pro-Russian rebels who were seizing government buildings in towns across the region. Nearly 13,000 people have died since the start of the conflict, according to UN figures. Ukraine's newly elected president Volodymyr Zelensky is vowing to stand up to his powerful neighbor, Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky, a former actor and comedian without previous experience in politics, rose to power as voters grew increasingly frustrated with rampant corruption, a flagging economy and the governing of former President Petro Poroshenko. In addition to the crisis in Donbas, Zelensky is facing those inherited issues as well. How he will handle them remains to be seen.",17,4.804709403848288,4.839391943449814,-0.03468253960152623,1
2019-06-19,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/europe/malaysia-airlines-flight-17-suspects-intl/index.html,MH17 crash investigators say four suspects face murder charges,"Four people will be charged with murder and causing the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, five years after the plane was shot down in eastern Ukraine killing 298 people, international investigators said Wednesday. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said it would issue national and international arrest warrants for the four suspects. Three Russians, Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy and Oleg Pulatov, were named, along with Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko. The flight was on its way from Amsterdam to the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur in July 2014, when it was shot out of the sky over territory held by pro-Russian separatists. According to investigators, Girkin is a former colonel of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), Dubinskiy was employed by Russia's military intelligence agency GRU and Pulatov was a former soldier of the Russian special forces, Spetsnaz-GRU. Ukraine's Kharchenko had no military background, but is believed to have led a combat unit in Donetwsk in July 2014. While the suspects are not accused of firing the missile at MH17, they are ""just as punishable as the person who committed the crime,"" Dutch prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said. All four are charged with ""causing the crash of MH17, leading to the death of all the people on board ... and murdering 298 passengers of flight MH17,"" Westerbeke said. He added that they are suspected of obtaining the Buk missile ""with the goal to shoot a plane."" The trial of the four men will take place on March 9, 2020 at the Schiphol Judicial Complex in Badhoevedorp, investigators said, adding that the accused will be tried in absentia if necessary. Investigators said they would not ask for the suspects to be extradited because the Russian and Ukrainian constitutions prohibit extraditing nationals. However added that they would ask Russia to cooperate with the investigation, and both countries to question the suspects about the charges. Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, welcomed the charges from the international investigators and said he hopes all guilty parties face justice. ""Ukraine welcomes the conclusions of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) regarding MH17,"" said a tweet posted Wednesday on the account of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine. ""The President of Ukraine hopes that not only those the Security Service of Ukraine has announced suspicions about today, but also those who are guilty of the deliberate murder of innocent children, women and men, will be put in the dock,"" the tweet continued. During a Q&A following the briefing on Wednesday, Ukraine said it would try to arrest Kharchenko. Later on Wednesday Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the findings were ""absolutely unfounded accusations,"" and that the JIT press conference was aimed at ""discrediting"" Russia. ""No concrete evidence this time was shown to back up such unlawful statements,"" the MFA said in a statement posted online. It also disputed that Russia has refused to fully cooperate with the investigation. ""We strongly reject such accusations,"" the statement read. ""From the first day of the tragedy, the Russian Federation was highly interested in establishing the truth and is ready to provide all-round assistance to the investigation."" Meanwhile Girkin -- one of the suspects who acted as defense minister for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic -- said separatists in eastern Ukraine were not responsible for downing the Boeing aircraft, adding that investigators had not contacted him about the case. ""The (separatist) rebels did not down the Boeing, and I cannot comment further or clarify,"" he told Russia's Business FM radio. Asked if the JIT had contacted him -- which is made up of five countries: Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine -- Girkin said, ""No, they have not contacted me."" Investigators announced in 2018 that the flight had been brought down by a missile fired from a launcher belonging to Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the incident, suggesting instead that Ukrainian forces shot down the plane.",13,4.208907193189676,7.192808365149569,-2.983901171959893,27
2019-04-04,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/04/politics/pompeo-nato-turkey-china/index.html,"Pompeo pushes back against Turkey, stands by US account of disputed meeting","Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US did not misrepresent or fabricate details about a meeting he held Wednesday with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, as tensions escalate between the NATO allies. ""Stand by every word of it,"" Pompeo said Thursday in a direct rebuttal to Turkey's claim Wednesday that a US statement about the meeting ""not only fails to reflect the content of the meeting, but also contains matters that were not even raised during the said meeting."" The US readout of that meeting could pass for a list of irritants in Washington's relationship with Ankara. The State Department said Pompeo had warned against unilateral Turkish military action in Syria, called for the ""swift resolution of cases involving unjustly detained US citizens,"" including local staff from the US consulate in Istanbul, and raised his concerns about Turkey's potential acquisition of the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system. 'Spot on' Asked about the Turkish claims on Thursday, at the close of a meeting of NATO members, Pompeo said, ""I reread, I saw the comments by my Turkish counterpart. I reread the readout of our meeting. Spot on. Stand by every word of it."" ""I think the Turkish Government understands the American position quite clearly,"" Pompeo said. ""I think I heard the vice president speak to that yesterday as well. Our position hasn't changed. There's great opportunity for the United States and Turkey to work closely together, and I had a good, long conversation with my, with the Turkish foreign minister yesterday and I'm very confident we'll find a path forward."" Pompeo spoke at the close of a meeting to mark the 70th anniversary of the 29-member trans-Atlantic alliance, touching on threats from Iran and Chinese technology giant Huawei -- repeating his threat that the US may not share intelligence with countries that buy its equipment -- as well as the situation in Venezuela. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had agreed on ""a package of measures to improve our situational awareness"" and to step up support for Georgia and Ukraine with training for their maritime forces and coast guards, port visits and exercises, and information sharing. The alliance also called for Russia to end its annexation of Crimea, release Ukrainian sailors and ships seized in a 2018 confrontation, and adhere to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty. Turkey's planned purchase of the $2.5 billion S-400 anti-aircraft missile system has become a particular point of tension. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence warned Turkey against going ahead with the purchase of the Russian-made missile system, hours after the Turkish foreign minister said the acquisition was ""a done deal"" and that Turkey wouldn't back down. Speaking Wednesday at the NATO Engages summit in Washington, Pence said the weapons purchase could ""threaten the very cohesion of this alliance."" 'We'll not stand by' ""We've also made it clear that we'll not stand idly by while NATO allies purchase weapons from our adversaries,"" Pence said. US officials have long warned Turkey that it would not be allowed to acquire the F-35 stealth jet if it goes ahead with the missile system purchase. The US believes that the Russian system is incompatible with the F-35 jet and says Moscow could use it to gather intelligence on the aircraft. On Monday the Pentagon announced it would halt all F-35 equipment transfers to Turkey unless Ankara irrevocably abandoned plans to acquire the S-400 system. ""Turkey must choose. Does it want to remain a critical partner of the most successful military alliance in the history of the world? Or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making reckless decisions that undermine our alliance?"" Pence said Wednesday. His comments drew a sharp response from his Turkish counterpart, who issued an ultimatum of his own, demanding the US end its support for Kurdish groups in Syria who have fought ISIS. Chinese risks ""The United States must choose. Does it want to remain Turkey's ally or risk our friendship by joining forces with terrorists to undermine its NATO ally's defense against its enemies?"" Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote on Twitter. Pompeo also said Thursday that the US had shared its risk analysis on Chinese technology from the telecom giant Huawei and reiterated that the US would not be able to share information with countries that use that technology in their security systems. ""There is undoubtedly the risk that NATO or the United States will not be able to share information in the same way it could if there were not Chinese systems inside of those networks, inside of those capabilities,"" Pompeo said. ""We've done our risk analysis in the United States; we have now shared that with our NATO partners, with countries all around the world."" ""They understand the concerns, not our concerns, but the factual concerns associated with companies so deeply connected to their own government who would be willing to act at the behest of their government, the risk that that presents to information management,"" he continued. ""And we've made clear that if the risk exceeds the threshold for the United States, we simply won't be able to share that information any longer,"" Pompeo said. ""Our task is to do education, make sure they understand every sovereign nation that will make its own decision, and then the United States will make its decision.""",29,4.660004299136564,0.6368646654140928,4.023139633722471,28
2019-04-03,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/03/politics/nato-70-stoltenberg-congress/index.html,NATO chief stresses unity in pushback against Trump's worldview,"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg delivered a pointed and robust defense of the trans-Atlantic alliance to Congress on Wednesday, stressing the need for unity in the face of deep global shifts and ""unforeseen"" challenges ahead. Stoltenberg indirectly addressed President Donald Trump's criticism of NATO and his push for an ""America First"" unilateral approach to the world throughout the speech and touched on trade and economic relations, another point of tension between the Trump administration and Europe. ""When we stand together, we are stronger than any potential challenger -- economically, politically and militarily,"" said Stoltenberg, the first NATO chief to address a joint meeting of Congress. ""We need this collective strength, because we will face new threats,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We need a strategy to deal with uncertainty. We have one. That strategy is NATO."" ""Questions are being asked on both sides of the Atlantic about the strength of our partnership. And yes, there are differences,"" the NATO chief acknowledged, listing climate change, trade and the Iran nuclear deal. ""Open discussion and different views is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of strength."" 'Most difficult problem' Stoltenberg delivered his remarks to mark NATO's 70-year history as the trans-Atlantic alliance faces unprecedented challenges, chief among them, according to veteran US and foreign diplomats, Trump and ""the absence of strong, principled American presidential leadership."" ""Trump is regarded widely in NATO capitals as the Alliance's most urgent, and often most difficult, problem,"" said the February report by Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and its Kennedy School based on interviews with current European and North American leaders, former senior officials, academics and journalists. The report notes ""Trump's open ambivalence about NATO's value to the US, his public questioning of America's Article 5 commitment"" which mandates that members come to the defense of any nation in the alliance that's been attacked, as well as his ""persistent criticism of Europe's democratic leaders and embrace of its anti-democratic members and continued weakness in failing to confront NATO's primary adversary President Vladimir Putin of Russia."" All these factors, wrote the Harvard study's authors, Nicholas Burns, a former Undersecretary of State appointed by President George W. Bush, and Douglas Lute, a former US ambassador to NATO from 2013 to 2017, ""have hurtled the Alliance into its most worrisome crisis in memory."" The NATO chief threaded his 39-minute address, which was repeatedly interrupted by applause, with references to shared sacrifices of blood and treasure -- particularly in NATO's continued deployment to Afghanistan since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Europe and Canada have also provided the US with a platform to project power, access to intelligence and cyber capabilities and partnerships on next-generation military capabilities that create jobs in all three places. Stoltenberg noted that while there have been moments of deep disagreement within the alliance before -- he cited the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- ""the strength of our alliance is that we've been able to unite around keeping our people safe."" 'Obsolete' ""We have overcome our disagreements in the past and we must overcome our differences now, because we will need our Alliance even more in the future,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Our Alliance has not lasted for 70 years out of a sense of nostalgia, or of sentiment,"" he said. ""NATO lasts because it is in the national interest of each and every one of our countries."" The alliance faces challenges that include a shifting balance of global power, an assertive Russia, cyberthreats, the wild card of technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, the conflict in Afghanistan and terrorism, Stoltenberg said. He didn't list the challenge posed by alliance members such as Turkey and Italy, which are allying themselves more closely with Russia and China. The 29-member group has also had to contend with Trump's repeated criticisms, among them his declaration that the alliance is ""obsolete"" and his frequent, public expressions of frustration that most NATO allies do not meet the two percent of GDP target that the alliance recommends members spend on defense. The President's supporters that say allies should not focus on everything Trump says, but on what his administration does. ""Some leaders may be dissatisfied with President Trump's rhetoric,"" said Nile Gardiner, a director at the Heritage Foundation, ""but to assert that he is not committed to the NATO alliance and our partners in Europe does not match up with the reality of US policy."" Gardiner points to the Trump administration increasing troop presence in Eastern Europe, investing more in the European Deterrence Initiative, a rapid reaction force against potential Russian aggression, its consideration of a US troop presence in Poland and its sanctions against Russia. And he flags the President's insistence that NATO members spend more on their defense. Stoltenberg, in his only mention of the President, praised Trump for the ""clear message"" that the alliance must boost spending, adding that ""this message is having a real impact."" 'This is making NATO stronger' ""In just the last two years, European Allies and Canada have spent an additional 41 billion dollars on defense,"" Stoltenberg said. ""By the end of next year, that figure will rise to one hundred billion. This is making NATO stronger."" Asked about the Harvard study at a Monday press conference in Brussels, the NATO chief said, ""sometimes I agree, sometimes I disagree, but the fact is that we see that North America and Europe are doing more together than they've done for many, many years."" Stoltenberg pointed to reasons the alliance should continue to work together in the years to come, including Afghanistan and the fight against terror groups such as ISIS, but he gave Russia special emphasis. Moscow's increasing aggression includes disinformation campaigns and electoral interference, cyber attacks, support for the Syrian regime, interference in Ukraine and Crimea's annexation, the use of a military-grade nerve agent in the US, as well as ""a massive military build up from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and from the Black Sea to the Baltic."" Stoltenberg pointed in particular to Russia's deployment of mobile, nuclear capable missiles in Europe that he said are ""hard to detect. ... cut the warning time to just minutes and reduce the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict."" ""I continue to call on Russia to return to compliance with the INF Treaty, but so far, Russia has taken no steps to do so,"" Stoltenberg said. ""And time is running out."" ""NATO has no intention of deploying land-based nuclear missiles in Europe,"" he said, ""but NATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence.""",29,1.0008315798800596,0.7242923951485231,0.2765391847315365,9
2019-04-02,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/02/politics/trump-stoltenberg-nato-praise/index.html,"Trump praises NATO chief, says he's happy allies are 'paying'","President Donald Trump, a sometime NATO skeptic, praised the alliance's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Tuesday, saying his performance ""has been outstanding."" ""The relationship with NATO has been very good, the relationship with the secretary general has been outstanding,"" Trump said while sitting next to Stoltenberg at the White House. ""He's done an excellent job, and when it came time to renew, because a lot of people wanted that job, it's a great job, it really is, but a lot of people wanted it but I had no doubt in my mind who I wanted,"" Trump added, referencing the recent decision by all 29 allies to extend Stoltenberg's tenure by two years. Trump has long criticized NATO countries over their failure to spend enough on defense and meet the two percent of GDP target recommended by the alliance, a target being met by only seven members presently. 'People are paying and I'm very happy' Asked if he was considering pulling the US out of NATO, Trump answered: ""People are paying and I'm very happy with the fact that they're paying."" While previous presidents had made similar critiques of NATO members' defense spending, Trump has made it a central theme of his presidential campaign and his administration's foreign policy, once calling the alliance ""obsolete"" and repeatedly slamming allies over the spending issue and linking it to trade disputes with the European Union. One way Stoltenberg has been able to ease Trump's opposition has been to embrace a similar cause, the need to get allies to spend more, while simultaneously crediting Trump with progress toward those goals. Stoltenberg has repeatedly cited defense spending increases among the non-US members of NATO, thanking Trump Tuesday ""for your very strong leadership on burden sharing."" ""After years of cutting defense budgets NATO allies have now started to invest more and by the end of next year they will have added $100 billion more into their defense budgets since you took office, and that helps and it proves also that NATO is a strong alliance,"" he added. Trump referenced those same statistics and Stoltenberg's prior comments crediting him with the spending boost during his praise for the NATO leader. ""A lot of people don't like giving credit, like the media never gives me credit but he gave me credit, now we're up to way over $100 billion and it's going to be a lot higher than that by the end of 2020, but I appreciate the job he's done,"" Trump said Tuesday. Challenges beyond Trump In addition to handling a skeptical American President, Stoltenberg, who took office in 2014, has also had to contend with a militarily resurgent Russia and disagreements among various allies over a range of issues. Stoltenberg, a former Prime Minister of Norway, has cited that experience including his time leading a coalition government of various parties, with helping him handle disagreements among allies. ""I have been a prime minister for 10 years in Norway, I have been prime minister in a coalition government and I would say that that was a good experience to have when I went on to NATO,"" he said Monday during a press conference in Brussels. When he entered office in 2014 the alliance was scrambling to confront Russia who had recently seized Crimea from Ukraine and was backing separatist fighters in the country's east. But NATO has been able to mobilize in the face of the threat from Moscow, agreeing in 2016 to deploy multi-national battalions to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as part of an effort to reassure the easternmost allies. Other issues have also confronted the alliance including divisions among its members over a range issues, particularly disagreements between the US and Turkey over Syria policy. Though NATO has added members during Stoltenberg's tenure, including Montenegro in 2017. North Macedonia is also likely to join NATO soon following a name deal between that country and Greece. Russia was critical of both countries' joining the alliance and the government of Montenegro has accused Moscow of backing an assassination plot aimed at derailing its NATO membership. The two-year extension will bring Stoltenberg's tenure to an end on September 30 2022, making him the second longest serving secretary general in the history of the 70-year old alliance, second only to Joseph Luns who led-NATO from 1971 to 1984 Stoltenberg will address a joint session of Congress Wednesday, following an invitation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

The goal of the experiment, which was conducted by NATO's Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, was to ""exploit social media and open source data to gather information on and influence military personnel during a military exercise."" ""The level of personal detail we found was very detailed and enabled us to instill undesirable behavior during the exercise,"" the report said, adding that the scope of the experiment was ""limited"" when compared to ""large-scale efforts such as the work undertaken by the Kremlin's Internet Research Agency to influence the US presidential election 2016."" ""We identified a significant amount of people taking part in the exercise and managed to identify all members of certain units, pinpoint the exact locations of several battalions, gain knowledge of troop movements to and from exercises, and discover the dates of the active phases of the exercise,"" the report said. Details of the experiment were first reported by Wired. The experiment used Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to gather information although the report said Twitter ""was rarely used during the exercise, and gave no useful information."" ""Our experiment showed that, at the current level of information security, an adversary is able to collect a significant amount of personal data on soldiers participating in a military exercise, and that this data can be used to target messages with precision, successfully influencing members of the target audience to carry out desired behaviors,"" the report added while noting that effort encountered some challenges as social media companies pushed back on some of the fake accounts, indicating they ""are increasing their efforts to prevent abuse of their platforms."" The report said that ""Facebook in particular provided significant pushback,"" suspending several of the fake accounts and pages used during the experiment. NATO regularly conducts large-scale exercises in order to maintain the readiness of its military forces. One of the more recent exercises, Trident Juncture, took place in October-November and involved some 50,000 personnel from NATO and partner countries as well as hundreds of aircraft, dozens of ships and up to 10,000 military vehicles. While the efforts detailed in the report were only an experiment, officials have said that Russia has similarly used social media and other measures in its attempts to affect NATO troops deployed near the alliance's eastern border with Russia. ""We have seen some hybrid warfare tactics used against NATO troops in the eastern part of our Alliance, including disinformation, false allegations of criminal activity, and attempts to hack or intimidate our soldiers on social media,"" NATO official told CNN. ""It is important that NATO Allies continue to train their troops to be vigilant, including online. At the same time, we are strengthening our cyber defenses and taking all necessary measures to protect our networks,"" the official added. NATO has boosted its military presence in the eastern part of the alliance a move seen largely as a response to Russia's 2014 military intervention in Ukraine and Moscow's seizure of Crimea. Some 4,500 NATO troops are deployed as part of four multinational battle groups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The battle groups are led by the UK, Canada, Germany and the US respectively.

2019-02-08,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/europe/salisbury-attack-bulgaria-poisonings-suspect-intl/index.html,Salisbury attack suspect linked to 2015 poisonings in Bulgaria,"Almost a year after a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned in the British town of Salisbury, fresh evidence uncovered by the investigative website Bellingcat appears to place one of the suspects in the vicinity of another series of poisonings in Bulgaria in 2015. Travel details obtained by Bellingcat and shared with CNN appear to show that a suspected Russian operative -- known by the cover name ""Sergey Vyacheslavovich Fedotov"" -- visited Bulgaria on two separate occasions in April and May 2015, around the same days that a Bulgarian arms manufacturer Emilian Gebrev and his son Hristo were poisoned. Around the time of both Bulgarian poisonings, Fedotov appears to have skipped his original return flight to Russia, in a pattern he seemingly replicated three years later following the attack in Britain, according to Bellingcat. In that case, Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter Yulia were found slumped over on a bench in Salisbury last March after being exposed to a military-grade nerve agent. British authorities blamed the attack on hitmen from Russia's intelligence agency, the GRU. The revelations about the poisonings in Bulgaria three years earlier raise the prospect that the Salisbury attack may not have been the first time a nerve agent was used by Russian agents on EU soil. It could also mean businesspeople in sensitive sectors have been targeted — not just former spies. Blurred vision, vomiting and blackouts Speaking to CNN this week, Gebrev, 65, said he fell ill sometime around April 25, 2015 and collapsed days later at an event he was hosting in Sofia. He believes he may have been poisoned in a restaurant but said he could not be sure. He was admitted to hospital on April 28 suffering blurred vision, vomiting and blackouts, and eventually slipped into a coma. His 40-year old son also fell ill, as did his factory director. All three eventually recovered, but still suffer recurring symptoms to this day, Gebrev said. Reviewing a combination of Russian border control data and flight bookings which were shared with CNN, Bellingcat says it determined Fedotov flew from Moscow to Bourgas in Bulgaria on April 24 and had a ticket booked to depart from Sofia on April 30. Instead, he flew back from Istanbul in neighboring Turkey two days earlier, on April 28, the day Gebrev was admitted to hospital. The same travel records show he returned to Bulgaria on May 23, failed to take a return flight from Sofia five days later, and instead made his way back to Moscow on a May 30 flight from Belgrade, a roughly five-hour drive from the Bulgarian capital. These dates correspond with the time Gebrev says he fell ill for a second time, though he did not provide CNN with specific dates of his second round of hospital treatment. He said the poisoning has left him anguished with lapses in his memory. Bellingcat's travel records also place Fedotov's GRU passport in the UK around the time of the Skripals' poisoning on March 4, 2018. He arrived in the UK on March 2, but although he had a ticket to leave two days later, he appears to have skipped that flight too. Since then he has vanished. His current whereabouts and true identity remain a mystery. Nerve agent or insecticide? Central to Gebrev's case is a medical report compiled in June 2015 by the Finnish Institute for the Verification of the Chemical Weapons Convention -- an accredited test center of the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons -- to which Bulgaria sent the Gebrevs' urine samples, amid concerns they may have been targeted with a banned substance. The test results, obtained by Bellingcat and seen by CNN, concluded the men had been poisoned with a strong organophosphate and a second substance which they were unable to identify with standard chemical weapons testing tools. Organophosphates can be used as insecticides, medicines and nerve agents. Novichok, the poison used to target the Skripals in Salisbury, belongs to this class of chemicals. Novichok, which was designed by Soviet scientists to be hard to detect, was not identified in the samples. But several banned chemicals were listed as possible candidates for the poisoning, including Parathion, a strong insecticide, and Amiton, another type of pesticide which is also considered a member of the VX family of nerve agents. The Finnish institute did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Looking for motives Gebrev owns a munitions factory, EMCO, in Bulgaria, a country with a historically large defense industry -- a legacy from the time it spent behind the Iron Curtain. Founded in 1992, EMCO sells an array of munitions to many parts of the globe but does not publicize the type of weaponry it makes or its export markets. A report on Bulgaria's arms business by the peace-promoting organization SaferWorld claimed that by the year 2000 EMCO had become one of the country's largest privately-owned arms manufacturers and had sold $25 million dollars of weapons to African nations, including Ethiopia and Angola. More recent data on EMCO's activities have been hard to source. Bulgarian media have reported, however, that it was EMCO's deals with Ukraine as it fought off an incursion from Russia in 2014 that may have made him a target a year later. Although Gebrev confirmed to CNN he did ship his wares to Ukraine, he doubted this would have made him a target. British authorities have remained tight-lipped about the motive behind Russia's attempt on the Skripals' lives last year. CNN revealed in July that the UK had identified two Russian GRU suspects via CCTV who flew out of the country soon after the Skripals became sick. However, it took until early September before the Metropolitan Police, whose counter-terrorism unit is running the Salisbury probe, charged the men, using their fake names. Weeks later, Bellingcat revealed their true identities. Both men maintained later on Russian television that they were businessmen and had been visiting Salisbury as tourists. When asked by CNN whether it was aware of Fedotov's alleged visits to Bulgaria, the Metropolitan police told CNN it was ''not prepared to discuss further details of what remains an ongoing investigation.'' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said his office had seen the report, published late Thursday by Bellingcat, but had no reason to believe its veracity, and questioned why the information was emerging now. On a call with reporters, Peskov said: ""There is only one question really -- how is it possible that poisoning by some military grade agent in Europe went unnoticed in 2015 and why are we only now finding out about this?""
