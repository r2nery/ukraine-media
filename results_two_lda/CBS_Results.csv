2022-11-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-us-election-interference-yevgeny-prigozhin-putin-chef-oligarch/,"Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, ""Putin's chef,"" admits interference in U.S. elections","Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a key figure in the war in Ukraine, admitted bluntly on Monday to interfering in U.S. elections. ""Gentlemen, we interfered, we are interfering, and we will interfere,"" declared Prigozhin in a statement quoted by his company, Concord. The oligarch has been sanctioned by Washington for running a ""troll factory"" to influence the outcome of votes in the U.S. and elsewhere. ""Accurately, precisely, surgically, and the way we do it, the way we know how to,"" Prigozhin quipped in response to a request for comment on the specifics of the interference from a Russian news outlet. Prigozhin is the financial benefactor behind a so-called Russian ""troll farm"" previously called the Internet Research Agency. The group, which has changed it's name multiple times, creates and uses inauthentic social media pages to spread misinformation or incendiary speech to affect voters and sow discord. Such organizations are believed to exist in Russia, China and Iran, at least, with the same intent. The U.S. Treasury Department accused Prigozhin and the Internet Research Agency of interfering in the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterm elections. The organization was frequently mentioned by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his probe into Russia's election interference. In July, the State Department offered a reward of up to $10 million for information on Prigozhin in connection with his ""engagement in U.S. election interference."" Prigozhin's own admission came on the eve of this week's round of U.S. midterm elections, which will be key to shaping the rest of President Joe Biden's presidency. It was the first such admission from an individual who has been formally accused by Washington of efforts to influence American politics. Speaking on Sunday to CBS' ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan, Chris Krebs, the former director of the U.S. government cybersecurity agency said, ""we've seen reports of Russia, China, Iran back at their old tricks,"" referring to online interference operations. Krebs said two U.S. research firms had released information suggesting trolls linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency ""are back at it and are undermining Democratic candidates for Senate"" in this week's midterms. Combined with Elon Musk's tumultuous takeover of Twitter, Krebs said it was all ""going to create a very chaotic environment"" for the U.S. democratic process. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied ever seeking to influence elections in the U.S. or any other outside nation. Russian President Vladimir Putin ridiculed Mueller's 2018 indictment of 13 Russians accused of a conspiracy to meddle in the presidential election that put Donald Trump in the White House. ""How low the Western information and political environment has fallen if a restauranteur from Russia could influence elections in the United States or a European country,"" the Russian leader said at the time, referring to Prigozhin. The businessman is sometimes called ""Putin's chef"" for the lucrative catering contracts he received from the Russian state. The oligarch has kept a low profile for years, but recently Prigozhin has emerged as an increasingly public figure as the mercenaries from his Wagner Group have become a key force in bolstering Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Prigozhin denied bankrolling the Wagner Group for years, but in September he admitted to funding the pseudo-military company since 2014. Since then, the private Wagner army has helped advance the Kremlin's geopolitical and business objectives in conflicts from Syria and Africa to Ukraine.",20,0.0,0.0,0.0,29
2022-11-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-cafe-blaze-kills-at-least-13-people-injures-5/,"Russia cafe blaze kills at least 13 people, injures 5","MOSCOW — A fire in a cafe in the Russian city of Kostroma killed at least 13 people and injured five others on Saturday, local authorities said. The governor of the Kostroma region, Sergei Sitnikov, said 13 people died in the fire and five more were slightly injured. Russian news agency Interfax cited local emergency officials as saying that the death toll stood at 15. The contradicting numbers couldn't be immediately reconciled. The blaze erupted in the early hours after someone apparently used a flare gun, according to the authorities. The Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported that a brawl erupted in the cafe shortly before the fire, but it wasn't immediately clear if it had anything to do with the use of a flare gun. Rescuers were able to evacuate 250 people. The roof of the cafe collapsed during the fire, which engulfed an area of 3,500 square meters (more than 37,000 square feet). Firefighters spent five hours battling the blaze, and a dozen residents of a nearby residential buildings were evacuated as a precaution. A criminal investigation has been launched, and the police have arrested a suspect. Ikhtiyar Mirzoyev, a member of the regional legislature and owner of the cafe, promised assistance to those affected by the fire. Kostroma, a riverside city of 270,000, is located roughly 340 kilometers (210 miles) north of Moscow. It wasn't the first time that pyrotechnics caused a deadly fire at a recreational venue in Russia. In 2009, more than 150 people were killed in a blaze at the Lame Horse nightclub in the city of Perm that erupted after someone set off fireworks.",47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
2022-11-04,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-attacks-2021-fincen-report-billion/,Ransomware crimes netted more than $1 billion last year,"Victims of cybercrime shelled out a record $1.2 billion to have their data returned last year as ransomware attacks have grown in size and intensity, according to newly released federal data. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, reported that banks processed a billion-plus dollars last year in what were likely ransomware payments. That's more than double the amount of money from 2020, the report concluded. The top five highest-paid ransomware incidents all came from attackers who were connected to Russia, FinCEN said. The report ""reminds us that ransomware — including attacks perpetrated by Russian-linked actors — remains a serious threat to our national and economic security,"" Himamauli Das, FinCEN's acting director, said in a statement this week. Ransomware is a type of computer hack where an attacker accesses someone's digital device and locks the owner out of their own files. After the lockout, the hacker contacts the owner and demands a payment before restoring access to the files. If there's no payment, the hacker threatens to keep the owner locked out or delete the files completely. FinCEN, which started in 1990, is an arm of the U.S. Department of Treasury charged with tracking international money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. FinCEN said hackers initially focused ransomware attacks on individuals, but have graduated to targeting large companies and demanding bigger payouts. Hackers in 2019 created a variation of ransomware attacks called double extortion, where they lock owners out of their files and then threaten to publish the data — which is often private or potentially embarrassing — if a payment isn't made. Indeed, 2021 had some of the biggest ransomware attacks on record aimed at large companies and nonprofits. A Russian hacking group attacked the Colonial Pipeline, one of the largest pipelines in the U.S., in May 2021. The company paid $4.3 million to retrieve its data, but federal authorities later recovered at least $2.3 million of the paid ransom. Hackers also attacked Planned Parenthood, Sinclair Broadcasting, Shutterfly and payroll processing company Kronos last year. All told, organizations reported 1,489 ransomware attacks to FinCEN in 2021, a 188% increase from 2020, the agency said. More recently, a ransomware attack last May marked the last straw for Lincoln College, a historically Black college in rural central Illinois that opened in 1865. The school gave hackers a $100,000 ransom, a payout that compounded financial troubles caused by plummeting enrollment in recent years. The 157-year-old institution shuttered in May. Ransomware attacks have become more common with the rise in remote work and e-learning, with schools becoming particularly vulnerable. The Biden administration brought together three dozen nations, the European Union and a slew of private-sector companies for a two-day summit this week looking at how best to combat the attacks. President Biden earlier this year signed a new law that requires owners of factories, banks, nuclear reactors and other critical infrastructure operations to report when their computer systems are hit with ransomware. Reporting is currently optional for ransom victims, making it difficult to calculate the full impact of the crime.",20,5.367049547580024,4.330966537807967,1.0360830097720566,2

The second International Counter Ransomware Summit will focus on priorities such as ensuring systems are more resilient, so they can better withstand attacks and disrupt bad actors planning such assaults. A senior Biden administration official cited recent attacks such as one that targeted the Los Angeles school district last month to underscore the urgency of the issue and the summit. ""We're seeing the pace and the sophistication of the ransomware attacks increasing faster than our resilience and disruption efforts,"" the senior administration official explained, in a briefing on the event. Among the administration officials planning to participate in the event are FBI Director Christopher Wray, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. President Joe Biden is not expected to attend. Participating countries are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, the European Commission, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States. Fifteen private-sector companies that are working with governments to prevent future ransomware attacks will also be attending. The companies that will take part include Crowdstrike, Mandiant, Cyber Threat Alliance, Microsoft, Cybersecurity Coalition, Palo Alto, Flexxon, SAP, the Institute for Security + Technology, Siemens, Internet 2.0, Tata – TCS and Telefónica.

2022-10-31,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/russia-ukraine-war-critical-infrastructure-hit-again-several-cities/,"Russia pounds Ukrainian cities with missiles, knocking out water and power","Kyiv — A massive barrage of Russian strikes on Monday morning hit critical infrastructure in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities. Russian missiles knocked out water and power supplies in the attack, which was apparent retaliation for what Moscow claims was a Ukrainian attack on its Black Sea Fleet over the weekend. Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces carried out ""strikes with long-range high-precision air and sea-based weapons against the military command and energy systems of Ukraine."" ""The goals of the strikes were achieved. All designated targets were hit,"" the ministry said in a statement. Ukraine's air force said it shot down 44 of more than 50 cruise missiles that were launched by Russia, but Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said missiles and drones hit 10 Ukrainian regions and damaged 18 objects, most of which were energy facilities. Hundreds of localities in seven Ukrainian regions were left without power, he said in a Facebook post, adding that ""the consequences could have been much worse"" if the Ukrainian forces hadn't shot down most of the Russian missiles. Loud explosions were heard across the Ukrainian capital in the early morning as residents prepared to go to work. Many received text messages from the emergency services about the threat of a missile attack, and air raid sirens wailed for three straight hours. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that 80% of consumers in the city of 3 million people were left without water supplies because of the damage to a power facility. Local authorities were working to restore the supplies as soon as possible, Klitschko said, telling Kyiv residents in the meantime to ""stock up on water from the nearest pump rooms and points of sale."" Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, vowed that the attacks on civilian facilities would not weaken Ukraine's resistance. ""We will persevere, and generations of Russians will pay a high price for their disgrace,"" Yermak said. The attacks came two days after Russia accused Ukraine of a drone attack against Russia's Black Sea Fleet off the coast of the annexed Crimean Peninsula. Ukraine has denied the attack, saying Russia mishandled its own weapons, but Moscow still announced that it was halting its participation in a U.N.-brokered deal to allow safe passage of ships carrying grain from Ukraine. It was the second time this month that Russia unleashed a massive barrage of strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure. On October 10, a similar attack rocked the war-torn country following an explosion on the Kerch Bridge, the sole land link between Ukraine's Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula and the Russian mainland. Moscow blamed Kyiv for blast, but Ukraine never publicly accepted responsibility. Monday's attacks occurred just before Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and many top members of his government, including the foreign, defense and interior ministers, arrived in Kyiv in the latest show of support from European leaders for Ukraine. Prime Minister Shmyhal said that in the Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions, emergency power shutdowns were underway. ""Today, just like in previous weeks, it is important that Ukrainians consume energy mindfully and reduce the load on the grid,"" the official said. Kyiv region Governor Oleksii Kuleba said one person was wounded and a number of houses were damaged in the morning attacks. ""The Kremlin is taking revenge for military failures on peaceful people who are left without electricity and heat before the winter,"" Kuleba said. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, two strikes hit critical infrastructure facilities, according to authorities, and the subway ceased operating. Officials also warned about possible power outages in the city of Zaporizhzhia resulting from the strikes there. The city of Zaporizhzhia still held by Ukrainian forces, but about 20 miles away in the city of Enerhodar sits Europe's biggest nuclear power plant. Fighting around the Russian-occupied plant has fueled concern for months over a possible accident, or even a deliberate attack leading to widespread radiological contamination. The Lviv region in western Ukraine was also targeted on Monday, but the missiles were shot down, Lviv Governor Maksym Kozytskyy said.",47,7.055936955880119,6.898052686537779,0.15788426934233968,23
2022-10-30,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/midterms-cisa-jen-easterly-election-infrastructure-face-the-nation/,"CISA chief sees no ""specific or credible threats"" to election infrastructure","Washington — Jen Easterly, head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said Sunday that her agency has not seen ""specific or credible threats"" to compromise election infrastructure before Election Day, now just over a week away. ""We have no information about specific or credible threats to disrupt or compromise election infrastructure. I want that to be very clear,"" Easterly said in an interview with ""Face the Nation."" ""We are putting out information, like the warnings that you mentioned, to make sure that state and local election officials have the information that they need to protect their voting systems and their election infrastructure."" Early voting for the midterm elections is already underway in many states, and more than 20 million people have already cast their ballots. Last week, the federal government issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning domestic violence extremists across the ideological spectrum pose a ""heightened threat"" to the midterm contests. The bulletin from a group of federal agencies and distributed to law enforcement partners across the country stated potential targets of violence by domestic violent extremists include candidates seeking public office, election officials and workers, political rallies and party representatives, among others. While Easterly said she is confident the November elections will be ""safe and secure,"" and believes Americans should feel the same way about the integrity of elections in their states, the CISA chief acknowledged there is still concern about voter intimidation and threats to election workers. ""It is a very complex threat environment,"" she said. ""You have cyber threats, you have insider threats, you have rampant disinformation. And yes, very worryingly, you have threats of harassment, intimidation and violence against election officials, polling places and voters. Let's be really clear. That has to stop."" Easterly said the behavior is ""unacceptable"" and ""undemocratic,"" and she encouraged cooperation and coordination across all levels of government to ensure the midterm elections are safe and secure. ""These elections, election officials, these are not faceless backroom bureaucrats,"" she said. ""These are our relatives, our friends, our neighbors. They're in our community. They are dedicated public servants that are working day in and day out to ensure the security of elections, and they deserve not just our support, but our admiration and respect, and they deserve to be safe. And we all need to be responsible about ensuring that's a safe and secure environment."" In addition to the threats from domestic violent extremists ahead of Election Day, Easterly also warned of cyber threats from nation states and cyber criminals, as well as disinformation campaigns from foreign actors to sow discord, undermine confidence in the elections systems and exploit vulnerabilities to incite violence. Like with Russia in 2016, China and Iran have also been behind influence operations, and Easterly said that underscores the importance of voters turning to ""trusted voices"" like local and state elections officials to understand who elections in their states work. ""If you see information that's on the internet, you're not sure whether it's true, be critical about it, ask questions, look at the source, investigate it and don't spread that information any more broadly and basically give foreign adversaries a chance to manipulate Americans and to sow discord and to create lack of confidence in our election,"" Easterly said.",20,6.361066626254823,3.8130174161780355,2.5480492100767878,29
2022-10-30,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/liz-truss-phone-hack-claim-uk-cybersecurity/,"U.K. politicians call for ""urgent independent investigation"" into Liz Truss phone hack claim","Political leaders in the United Kingdom have called for an investigation into the government's handling of national security, after an unconfirmed report claiming that a personal phone used by former Prime Minister Liz Truss was targeted by suspected Russian hackers. The Mail on Sunday report, which cited unnamed sources, suggested that private messages exchanged between Truss and foreign officials while she was foreign secretary — some apparently involving sensitive information about the war in Ukraine, and personal communication with former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng — were breached in the supposed cyberattack. It also claimed that U.K. government officials learned of the breach over the summer and suggested that former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who preceded Truss, and cabinet secretary Simon Case intentionally hid it from the media amid Truss' campaign to become the conservative party leader and prime minister. Truss, who was ultimately appointed by Queen Elizabeth II to succeed Johnson, announced her resignation earlier this month after just six weeks in office. A U.K. government spokesperson declined to ""comment on individuals' security arrangements"" in a statement to CBS News. ""The Government has robust systems in place to protect against cyber threats. That includes regular security briefings for Ministers, and advice on protecting their personal data and mitigating cyber threats,"" the statement said. Meanwhile, Michael Gove, who was recently reappointed to his government position as Levelling Up secretary, shared a similar response to questions about the alleged hack during an interview with Sky News on Sunday. ""I don't know the full details of what security breach, if any, took place,"" Gove said. ""What I do know is that the government has very robust protocols in place in order to make sure that individuals are protected, but also that government security and national security are protected as well."" However, Labour party leaders have demanded a probe into the potential cybersecurity breach, with Yvette Cooper, the party's law-and-order spokesperson, suggesting that the Mail on Sunday's report raises broader concerns about the British government and national security. ""Clearly these are very serious allegations,"" Cooper said later on Sky News. ""It raises issues around cybersecurity. It's why cybersecurity has to be taken so seriously by everyone across governments, the role of hostile states, but also the allegations about whether a cabinet minister has been using a personal phone for serious government business, and serious questions about why this information or this story has been leaked or briefed right now."" Cooper suggested that each of those issues points to ""the way in which the government is not taking seriously enough national security."" Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesperson, responded to reports of the alleged cyberattack on social media. ""We need an urgent independent investigation to uncover the truth. Was Liz Truss' phone hacked by the Kremlin, was there a news blackout and if so why?"" Moran tweeted. ""If this was withheld from the public to protect Liz Truss' leadership bid, that would be unforgivable."" The foreign affairs spokesperson doubled down on her calls for a probe in a second tweet posted Sunday. ""These allegations are extremely concerning and raise serious questions about a laxity at the heart of govt around using personal devices,"" she wrote, adding, ""We need an urgent investigation to uncover the truth.""

The latest aid means the U.S. has provided approximately $17.9 billion in support to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February, a State Department spokesperson said. The latest package is also expected to include 500 precision-guided 155mm rounds; 2,000 155mm rounds of Remote Anti-Armor Mine (RAAM) Systems; 125 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs); more than 1,300 anti-armor systems; small arms and more than 2.7 million rounds of small arms ammunition; and four satellite communications antennas. ""The United States will continue to stand with more than 50 allies and partners in support of the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence with extraordinary courage and boundless determination,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. Earlier this month, the U.S. committed another four HIMARS to Ukraine as part of a $625 million arms package. That package also included artillery systems, ammunition and armored vehicles. The U.S. has so far pulled 20 HIMARS from its own stocks for Ukraine. The advanced rocket systems and munitions allow Ukraine to target Russian command posts, ammunition hubs and support areas beyond the frontlines. The expected announcement comes as Ukraine and its allies, including the U.S., warned Russia against using a ""dirty bomb"" — a device that uses conventional explosives to spread radioactive material — in Ukraine. Russia's defense minister had claimed in a series of calls with defense officials from other countries that it was Ukraine that was preparing to detonate such a device in its own territory, an accusation that the U.S. and several allies called ""transparently false."" Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday also claimed, after months of rising tensions, that he had no intention of using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, according to The Associated Press. ""We see no need for that,"" Putin said, according to AP. ""There is no point in that, neither political, nor military."" Russia recently unleashed a wave of attacks using Iranian-made self-detonating drones around Kyiv and other regions. The Biden administration has promised 18 more HIMARS through a contracting process that will take ""a few years"" to deliver to Ukraine, a senior defense official said last month.

2022-10-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-russia-ukraine-dirty-bomb/,"NATO chief warns of ""severe consequences"" if Russia fires nuclear weapons","NATO's secretary general said there will be ""severe consequences"" if Russia fires nuclear weapons, as President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly threatened. The warning comes as U.S. forces and NATO allies conduct routine military drills in international waters, and as NATO's annual nuclear exercise is underway over northwestern Europe. ""It would be absolutely wrong if I went into the exact way we will react, but Russia knows that there will be severe consequences,"" Jens Stoltenberg told CBS News aboard the USS George H.W. Bush, a Navy aircraft carrier taking part in the defense drills. ""We are vigilant and ready to react if something bad happens."" ""Something bad"" could be a ""dirty bomb"" — an explosive loaded with radioactive material. Russia claims Ukraine wants to use one on the battlefield, although there is no evidence to support the allegation. A ""dirty bomb"" is not a nuclear bomb, and would be less harmful, but by using conventional explosives to spread radioactive material, it is an effective weapon of terror. Stoltenberg said the accusation could be a strategic tactic from Russia, foreshadowing what it aims to do instead. ""We have seen before that Russia has accused others for doing what they intend to do themselves,"" he said. ""So therefore, we are sending a strong message to Moscow that they should not try to use a false pretext as an excuse for escalation of the war in Ukraine."" For now, NATO says its best weapon is overwhelming deterrence with a display of firepower from fighter jets, helicopters and surveillance. If called upon, the fighters are ready to strike, but only to defend the alliance and not to provoke Russia, the organization insists. ""We don't seek conflict with Russia,"" Stoltenberg said. ""But of course, when we see more threats, when we see a more dangerous world, it's even more important that we send a clear message to any potential adversary that we are ready to defend all allies because that's the best way to prevent an attack and preserve peace.""

Ukrainian officials confirmed at least half a dozen regions were targeted, including the capital city, Kyiv. The air force said it downed 18 out of 33 cruise missiles launched from air and sea. ""Several rockets"" targeting the capital were shot down on Saturday morning, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging service. Similar reports were made by the governors of six western and central provinces, as well as the southern Odesa region on the Black Sea. The attack is part of Russia's latest strategy. Over the past two weeks, Moscow has increased its attacks on key civilian infrastructure across Ukraine, as the country braces for a cold winter. About 40% of the country's electric power system has been severely damaged, officials said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier in the week that 30% of Ukraine's power stations have been destroyed since Oct. 10. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine woke up to power outages. The western city of Khmelnytskyi, which straddles the Bug river and was home to some 275,000 people before the war, was left with no electricity Saturday, shortly after local media reported several loud explosions. The city council urged local residents to store water, ""in case it's also gone within an hour,"" in a social media post on Saturday. The mayor of Lutsk, a city of 215,000 in Ukraine's far west, made a similar appeal on Telegram on Saturday. Power in Lutsk had been partially knocked out after Russian missiles slammed into local energy facilities, he said. The central city of Uman, a key pilgrimage center for Hasidic Jews which counted some 100,000 residents before the war, was also plunged into darkness after a rocket hit a nearby power station, regional authorities said on Telegram. In the capital and four surrounding regions, including Cherkasy, rolling blackouts came into effect on Saturday morning in response to the reduced power supplies. The state energy company Ukrenergo continued to urge all Ukrainians to conserve energy. Earlier this week, Zelenskyy called on consumers to curb their power use between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. daily, and avoid using energy-guzzling appliances such as electric heaters.",47,5.091071391294037,5.730044295489021,-0.6389729041949845,23
2022-10-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/seattle/news/ukraine-news-russia-us-army-101st-airborne-nato-war-games-romania/,The U.S. Army's 101st Airborne is practicing for war with Russia just miles from Ukraine's border,"Mihail Kogălniceanu, Romania — The U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division has been deployed to Europe for the first time in almost 80 years amid soaring tension between Russia and the American-led NATO military alliance. The light infantry unit, nicknamed the ""Screaming Eagles,"" is trained to deploy on any battlefield in the world within hours, ready to fight. CBS News joined the division's Deputy Commander, Brigadier General John Lubas, and Colonel Edwin Matthaidess, Commander of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, on a Black Hawk helicopter for the hour-long ride to the very edge of NATO territory — only around three miles from Romania's border with Ukraine. From the moment Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, his forces have advanced northward from the Crimean Peninsula, a Ukrainian region that Moscow illegally seized control of in 2014. For more than seven months, Russian troops have tried to push along the Black Sea coast into the Kherson region, aiming to capture the key Ukrainian port cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa. Their goal is to cut off all Ukrainian access to the sea, leaving the country and its military forces landlocked. That threat, so close to NATO territory in Romania, is why one of America's most elite air assault divisions has been sent in, with some heavy equipment. ""We're ready to defend every inch of NATO soil,"" Lubas told CBS News. ""We bring a unique capability, from our air assault capability… We're a light infantry force, but again, we bring that mobility with us, for our aircraft and air assaults."" Skirting northward along Romania's Black Sea coast, the Black Hawk eventually touched down at a forward operating site where U.S. and Romanian troops were pounding targets during a joint ground and air assault exercise. The tank rounds and artillery fire were real. The drill was meant to recreate the battles Ukraine's forces are fighting every day against Russian troops, just across the border. The war games so close to that border are a clear message to Russia and to America's NATO allies, that the U.S. Army is here. ""The real meaning for me, to have the American troops here, is like if you were to have allies in Normandy before any enemy was there,"" Romanian Major General Lulian Berdila told CBS News, referring to the landmark World War II battle on France's north coast. The American forces have been establishing a garrison at the Romanian military's air base. In all, about 4,700 soldiers from the 101st Airborne's home base in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, have been deployed to reinforce NATO's eastern flank. Matthaidess told CBS News that he and his troops were the closest American forces to the fighting in Ukraine.

Security Council meeting late Wednesday, the U.S., U.K. and France accused Iran of selling drones to Russia in violation of a U.N. Security Council ban against the transfer of drones. Russia has used drones in a series of devastating attacks on Ukrainian cities this past week. Both Russia and Iran claimed to reporters that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or drones, were not sold by Iran to Russia, and not used in conflict. Nate Evans, spokesperson and communications director for the U.S. Mission to the U.N., called for an ""expert briefing"" in the Security Council ""on recent evidence that Russia illegally procured Iranian UAVs that it is using in its war on Ukraine."" Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's U.N. ambassador, wrote a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres Tuesday requesting U.N experts visit Ukraine to inspect the recovered UAVs which have been used to attack Ukrainian cities. The attacks have caused about 30% of Ukraine's power to shut down. In his letter, Kyslytsya noted that the drones used in the attacks meet the requirements under U.N. Security Council resolution 2231, passed in 2015, which bans the transfer of drones capable of traveling more than 300 kilometers. ""The United States began warning in July that Iran was planning to transfer UAVs to Russia for use in Russia's brutal war against Ukraine, and we now have abundant evidence that these UAVs are being used to strike Ukrainian civilians and critical civilian infrastructure,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement following the meeting. Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said that the 15-nation Security Council had no authority to send inspectors, an issue that will be taken up on Friday in an open Security Council meeting on Ukraine. Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran's U.N. ambassador, denied that Iran transferred drones to Russia for use in the war. James Kariuki, U.K.'s deputy ambassador to the U.N., tweeted Wednesday that ""Iran has obligations not to export these weapons."" On Wednesday, self-detonating drones launched by Russia struck power plants, and forced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to convene an emergency meeting to avoid what he called a ""breakdown of [Ukraine's] energy system."" Beginning about a week ago, Russia launched a flurry of attacks using Iranian-made self-detonating drones packed with explosives. Since the first kamikaze drone was launched last month, Ukraine claims it has shot down 223 of them. U.S. officials estimate Ukraine has a roughly 50% success rate, which would mean Russia has launched nearly 450 drones. — David Martin contributed to this report.",49,6.728108170847753,2.7779834084504964,3.950124762397256,10
2022-10-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iranian-supplied-kamikaze-drones-russia-ukraine-war/,The drone war: Iranian-supplied self-detonating drones usher in new era of warfare in Ukraine,"Russia's latest onslaught inside Ukraine has been led by Moscow's new weapon — Iranian supplied drones. It could possibly mark the dawn of a new kind of warfare in Ukraine. On Wednesday, self-detonating drones launched by Russia struck power plants, and forced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to convene an emergency meeting to avoid what he called a ""breakdown of [Ukraine's] energy system."" Retired U.S. Gen. Frank McKenzie, who was at one point in charge of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said the 11-foot-by-8-foot drone carries a relatively small 90-pound warhead that is powerful enough to destroy transformer yards. ""If you launch enough of them, the theory is you will be able to overcome air defense, because they fly at low altitudes, and they're very cheap to produce,"" McKenzie told CBS News. He added that Iran produces thousands of the drones. Since the first self-detonating drone was launched last month, Ukraine claims it has shot down 223 of them. U.S. officials estimate Ukraine has a roughly 50% success rate, which would mean Russia has launched nearly 450 drones. A 50% rate means more than 200 have gotten through, even though the Ukrainians use everything from guided missiles to small arms fire to try to bring them down. ""They don't necessarily fly a straight line,"" McKenzie said. ""They can do dog legs, different routes to try to avoid where they think you have your own air defenses up that can shoot at them.""",49,4.19859805010103,1.9883252588602134,2.210272791240816,10
2022-10-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/how-air-defense-systems-work-ukraine-russia-ballistic-cruise-missiles/,How air defense systems work and why Ukraine is eager for more protection,"Iain Boyd is a professor of aerospace engineering sciences at University of Colorado—Boulder. Ukraine has received a broad array of military supplies from the U.S. and other allies. Recently, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an urgent plea specifically for additional air defense resources from the West in response to increased air attacks by Russia. To understand Zelenskyy's emphasis on air defense, it's important to look at the types of air weapons that Ukraine faces and how air defenses work to counteract those threats. It's also important to understand why this type of warfare is all about the number of assets each side has at its disposal. On Oct. 10, 2022, Russia launched a large barrage of airborne weapons against a variety of targets in Ukraine. The types of weapons involved in the attack included short-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. Ballistic missiles are accelerated by rockets from the ground or from aircraft, tend to follow a predictable path and are somewhat easier to track. Cruise missiles carry a propulsion system that allows them to maintain speed and fly more unpredictable flight paths, including trajectories that are close to the ground. They are much more difficult to detect, track and shoot down. Then, on Oct. 17, Russia launched a barrage of explosive drones at Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv. Explosive drones, known as loitering munitions, tend to be small weapons that are difficult to defend against. By circling overhead, they are able to surveil a region of interest, gathering information before identifying a specific target to attack. Russia has acquired explosive drones from Iran, according to U.S. officials. The defense against all such air threats involves an integrated system of several elements. Early warning radars located at Ukraine's borders first detect the approach of missiles. These weapons are further tracked along their flight trajectories by a dispersed network of additional radars. The primary defensive countermeasure against ballistic and cruise missiles involves surface-to-air missiles: You destroy a missile using a missile. This is no easy feat because the SAM must track, home in on and hit a high-speed target that may be changing direction. In the U.S., key strategic assets such as the White House are protected against aerial attack by the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS). NASAMS was designed to counteract a variety of incoming threats, including cruise missiles, aircraft and drones. Each NASAMS contains 12 interceptor SAMs. No information is available publicly on its effectiveness. NASAMS is one of the options being considered by the U.S. to help support Ukraine. Another notable example of an air defense system is the Israeli Iron Dome. The system is designed to defend against rockets and artillery shells launched from up to 155 miles (250 kilometers) away. Each Iron Dome missile battery consists of three to four missile launchers, each with up to 20 interceptor SAMs. The system is reported to have a 90% kill rate for rockets launched against Israel. Veteran national security correspondent Mark Thompson described Iron Dome as possibly the most effective missile defense system the world has seen. Both NASAMS and Iron Dome are reported to be effective against drones. However, SAMs are an expensive way to defend against such low-cost targets, and they could be overwhelmed by large numbers of drones. Directed energy weapons such as high-energy lasers are being developed and deployed to provide a potentially more cost-effective approach to neutralizing low-cost drones. The significance of the plea by Zelenskyy for additional air defense systems can be understood in the context of a numbers game. Different air defense systems have a range of effectiveness against different aerial threats. However, none of the defense systems is 100% effective. Moreover, an adversary can significantly reduce the effectiveness of air defense by launching salvos of multiple weapons simultaneously. Therefore, an attacker can always overwhelm a defender if the attacker has more attack missiles than the defender has defensive missiles. Conversely, a sufficient number of defensive systems may cause an attacker to stop firing altogether. It becomes a war of attrition, with the winner being the side with the most missiles. Ukraine likely has sufficient air defenses to protect strategic military targets such as command and control centers and ammunition dumps. They do not have coverage of many other key assets such as transportation hubs and power and water facilities, the types of targets Russian forces have been targeting in recent days. Should the West agree to provide significant numbers of air defense systems to Ukraine, it could significantly change the course of the conflict. At some point, Russia will have to confront the finite depth of its missile stockpile. The number of remaining Russian high-precision missiles is already reported to be running low. Without the ability to wear down and demoralize Ukraine through airstrikes, Russia would be faced with the much more daunting and drawn-out prospect of relying solely on ground forces to grind out its objectives.

2022-10-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/seattle/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-iran-drones-kyiv-power-blackouts-putin-air-strikes/,Ukraine remains defiant as Russia destroys power stations and civilian homes with suicide drones and missiles,"Russia launched fresh strikes across Ukraine on Tuesday morning, continuing a days-long aerial assault under President Vladimir Putin's new war commander that has taken a serious toll on Ukrainian power infrastructure and civilians. Moscow insists it is only targeting power installations, and it has indeed hammered Ukraine's energy and water supplies, including a power plant in Kyiv that was hit Tuesday. With power cuts already spreading as Ukraine's harsh winter approaches — and with civilians being killed daily by the ongoing barrage of ""suicide drones"" that Russia is launching along with its missiles — Kyiv's mayor and Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy have labeled Russia a ""terrorist state."" A swarm of the Iranian-made, explosives-packed drones slammed into buildings in Kyiv on Monday killing four people, including Viktoria Zamchenko, who was reportedly six months pregnant with her first child. Ukraine claims Russia has ordered nearly 2,500 suicide drones from Iran, reportedly at a cost of around $20,000 each, a fraction of the price of a guided missile. Iran has denied that it is providing Russia with weapons for the war, but the Reuters news agency reported Tuesday, citing unnamed Iranian sources, that Tehran had actually agreed to provide Russia with even more weapons in a new deal arranged during an early-October visit by Iranian security officials to Moscow. The deal, which CBS News could not independently verify, apparently saw Iran promise not only drones, but surface-to-surface missiles. Ukraine's foreign minister said Tuesday that he was submitting a proposal to Zelenskyy to sever the country's diplomatic ties with Tehran completely over its provision of drones to Russia. Last week, a top British intelligence official said the Russian military's ""supplies and munitions are running out."" ""The world must stop this terror,"" Zelenskyy said Monday night, renewing his months-long plea for Western nations to provide Ukraine with more, and more advanced, air defense systems. Many of Ukraine's cities, including Kyiv, had been relatively calm for months. But since General Sergei Surovikin, or ""General Armageddon"" as he's also known, took over as commander of Putin's struggling war effort, Moscow has increasingly relied on the small, relatively cheap suicide drones, and they could have a significant impact on the course of the war. Russia's goal, according to Ukrainian officials, appears to be to destroy enough infrastructure and civilian lives that support for the war wanes inside Ukraine, and among its international partners. While there's been no indication that the Russian tactic is working to that end, Ukrainian officials have started warning people to brace for a difficult winter. ""The situation is critical now across the country,"" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of President Zelenksyy's office said on television. ""The whole country needs to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages."" Zelenskyy said in a tweet that ""30% of Ukraine's power stations"" had been destroyed over the last week alone, leading to ""massive blackouts across the country."" The power cuts were already hitting parts of the capital, the Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv, and Dnipro in the south. ""The terrorist state will not change anything for itself with such actions,"" Zelenksyy said in another message posted to the Telegram messaging app. ""It will only confirm its destructive and murderous essence, for which it will certainly be held to account."" In the meantime, Ukrainian civilians continue to pay the price. ""They [Russians] probably get pleasure from this,"" the owner of a flower shop in the southern city of Mykolaiv told the Reuters news agency after a Russian missile slammed into a nearby apartment building, killing one person and damaging his store. ""They get pleasure from us feeling bad. I think they want us to bomb and shell [their] city buildings. But we won't do that, to be different from them.""",47,3.2024318490668646,4.3028693802846805,-1.1004375312178158,23

The assaults reportedly killed at least eight people and came after a week of massive, coordinated Russian air strikes across the country. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in Ukraine, but as CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reported, one of the neighborhoods hit in Kyiv on Monday is packed with apartment buildings, schools and restaurants. Apartment blocks and a non-residential building were set alight in the capital's central Shevchenko district, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska tweeted photos of the damage in the capital and said three people were killed when a drone hit the apartment building, including a pregnant woman. ""Civilians, children, pregnant women — the ones RF [Russian Federation] is actually fighting with,"" said Zelenska, vowing that ""Ukrainians will never forget who murdered our relatives."" Emergency services later said a total of four people were killed in the strike on the building in the capital, and four others in drone strikes on the Sumy region. News photographers caught images of some of the drones as they flew into Kyiv, with triangle-shaped wings and a pointed warhead clearly visible against the blue sky. Drones came in several waves and buzzed overhead with angry hums from their engines. Videos posted to social media, including one seemingly taken by the body-camera worn by a member of Ukraine's national police force, showed security forces taking aim at the small aircraft from the ground with rifles. Russian strikes over the past week have hit apartment buildings and other civilian infrastructure, but also targeted infrastructure, including power facilities. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said the strikes on Monday hit critical energy infrastructure in three regions, knocking out electricity to hundreds of towns and villages. ""Russian terrorists once again attacked the energy infrastructure of Ukraine in three regions,"" Shmygal said, noting five strikes in Kyiv, in addition to attacks in the Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions. ""Hundreds of settlements were cut off as a result of the attack,"" he said. Explosions were heard from the same central Kyiv district where a missile strike a week ago tore a hole in a children's playground. Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, wrote in a post on the Telegram social media site that Russian forces struck Kyiv with Iranian Shahed drones. Russia has repeatedly been using the self-detonating drones in recent weeks to target urban centers and infrastructure, including power stations. ""The Russians think it will help them, but it shows their desperation,"" he said, according to AFP. ""All night and all morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday. ""Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine. The enemy can attack our cities but it won't be able to break us."" Strikes in central Kyiv became a rarity in the last several months after Russian forces failed to capture the capital in the beginning of the war. Last week's early morning strikes were the first explosions heard in Kyiv's city center in several months and put Kyiv as well as the rest of the country back on edge as the war nears the nine month mark. Monday's blasts seemed to continue what many fear could become more common occurrences in urban centers. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week's strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of a bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Putin blames Ukraine for masterminding the blast, which suspended traffic over the bridge and curtailed Moscow's ability to use the bridge to supply Russian troops in the occupied regions of southern Ukraine. The strike on Kyiv comes as fighting has intensified in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, as well as the continued Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Zelenskyy said in his evening address Sunday that there was heavy fighting around the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar in the Donetsk region. The Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the bulk of the industrial east known as the Donbas, and were two of four regions annexed by Russia in September in defiance of international law. On Sunday, the Russian-backed regime in the Donetsk region said Ukraine had shelled its central administrative building in a direct hit. No casualties were reported.",47,2.9633395456693505,2.7792128335632227,0.18412671210612785,23
2022-10-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bucha-gravediggers-60-minutes-2022-10-16/,The gravediggers of Bucha - 60 Minutes,"The town of Bucha lived in relative obscurity on the international stage until early spring when Russian occupying forces retreated from the town and left behind devastation and death that shocked the entire world. Over 27 days, Russian troops killed more than 400 civilians in the Kyiv suburb. Some of the victims were discovered bound and tortured. Many were left to rot in the place where they were killed. 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley visited the town after it was liberated following his early April interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He saw the devastation firsthand and witnessed a mass grave dug behind a church in the town center. Pelley vowed to return to learn more about the people who were killed and buried in that mass grave. In September, Pelley returned to Ukraine for a story on Sunday's broadcast titled ""The Lost Souls of Bucha."" While in Bucha, Pelley interviewed Serhii Kaplychnyi, Serhii Matiuk, And Vladyslav Minchenko, the three men who buried the dead in the mass grave behind St. Andrews Church. Kaplychnyi, the town's funeral director, negotiated access to bodies with the Russians. Minchenko and Matiuk retrieved the bodies. ""I understood one thing - if not us, who else will do it?"" Matiuk said to Pelley through an interpreter. ""We had a lot of thoughts. But the main thought was – this has to be done…you had to move all your bad thoughts, all your weaknesses to the side."" Trenches for the mass grave were dug in the shadow of St. Andrew's Church. Kaplychnyi told 60 Minutes the town chose the church because it was within the perimeters set by the Russians during their negotiations. St. Andrew's was the only logical location. There were no other options. ""We wanted to do it in a better way,"" Kaplychnyi said through a translator. ""In a human way, in a Christian way. I hope God can forgive us, but in the end we just had to stack bodies on top of each other and just bury them. There was no other way."" Father Andriy Halavin, the priest at St. Andrew's, gave Kaplychnyi and the team permission to dig the grave on church grounds. More than 100 people were buried there. Since the occupation ended last spring, the bodies have been exhumed and burials have been conducted – some by Father Halavin. He told us the world must not forget what happened in Bucha. ""The grass is growing. There are no trenches. There are no bodies of killed innocent people,"" Halavin said speaking through an interpreter. The priest said after the atrocities in Bucha were uncovered, Americans reached out to help. St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Minneapolis was among those who sent medicine and funds to repair damage in the town. ""We will never forget their help,"" Halavin told us. He's now working with Bucha officials to build a memorial at the church to remember the victims. Until then, Halavin has created a display of photographs capturing some of the most graphic and shocking images of the war. ""We left the photographs hanging up for people who come visit,"" Halavin told Pelley. ""They look at these buildings and ask what happened here…We are doing everything we can from the bottom of our hearts to show the world what has happened here.""

The drone attack set off air raid sirens and sent people running for shelters yet again in the capital, in a fourth day of reprisals by Moscow for a bombing that damaged a bridge providing the only land link between Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. Vladimir Putin's escalating war on Ukraine is now led by a hard-line commander whose reputation for brutality earned him the nickname ""General Armageddon."" For days it has been clear that the strategy is to increase the aerial assault not only on the front lines, where Russia has lost ground in recent weeks, but across Ukraine. It wasn't immediately clear if the self-detonating drones had killed or wounded anyone, but Ukrainian officials said Thursday that 13 people were killed and almost 40 others wounded over the preceding 24 hours of Russian missile strikes all around Ukraine. The southern city of Mykolaiv was struck again early Thursday, with Russian missiles destroying a five-story apartment building. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said an 11-year-old boy was rescued from the debris six hours after the strike, but seven others remained missing. Kim said Russia hit the building with an S-300 missile — a weapon designed, and usually used to bring down enemy aircraft. Russia has seemingly turned to the S-300s more often to carry out indiscriminate attacks on Ukrainian cities, amid intelligence reports that Putin's army is running low on weaponry, and on morale. ""We know, and Russian commanders on the ground know, that their supplies and munitions are running out,"" Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of Britain's cyber intelligence agency GCHQ said in a speech on Tuesday. The city of Zaporizhzhia — in Ukrainian-held territory but not far from the sprawling, Russian-occupied nuclear power plant that has been the focus of rising concern over a possible nuclear accident — was also hit again on Thursday. The city, about 20 miles from the nuclear plant, has been the target of relentless Russian bombardment. Some of the missiles have slammed down in residential areas, and CBS News saw rescuers pulling one victim from beneath the rubble of an apartment building. Over the past two weeks, more than 70 civilians have been killed by Russia's aerial assault in Zaporizhzhia alone, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukraine's military claims it has managed to shoot down dozens of the missiles and Iranian-made ""Shahed-136"" drones Russia has fired over the past week, but with so many still getting through to wreak havoc on the country's infrastructure and beleaguered civilians, it is desperate for more help. To stop the aerial assault, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy begged this week for the U.S. and other partners to send Ukraine more, and more advanced, missile defense systems. He was assured that help is on the way.",47,2.997024213760685,6.670920940966651,-3.673896727205966,23

Less than a month later, Dakle allegedly began communicating with a covert agent he believed was working for the Russian government, but was in fact an FBI agent. In August, Dalke requested $85,000 in return for the secrets he had taken. The filings show he then re-applied for a job at the NSA.

2022-10-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-kyiv-missile-attack-putin-crimea-bridge/,Russia rains missiles down on Ukraine's capital and other cities in retaliation for Crimea bridge blast,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that people were killed and injured in multiple missile strikes across Ukraine, including the first bombardment of the capital, Kyiv, in months. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the strikes, which could signal a major escalation in the eight-month-old war, appeared to be entirely punitive — retaliation meant to terrorize Ukrainian civilians in densely-populated urban neighborhoods, close to government buildings, with one even hitting a children's playground. The lethal barrage smashed into civilian areas, knocking out power and water, shattering buildings and killing at least 14 people. The bombardment came two days after Russia suffered a serious blow with the bombing that damaged its sole bridge to Crimea. Ukraine's Emergency Service said nearly 100 people were wounded in the morning rush hour attacks that Russia launched from the air, sea and land against at least 14 regions, spanning from Lviv in the west to Kharkiv in the east. Many of the attacks occurred far from the war's front lines. Though Russia said missiles targeted military and energy facilities, some struck civilian areas while people were heading to work and school. One hit a playground in downtown Kyiv and another struck a university. The attacks plunged much of the country into a blackout, depriving hundreds of thousands of people of electricity and creating a shortage so severe Ukrainian authorities announced they would have to stop power exports to Europe starting Tuesday. Power outages also often deprive residents of water, given the system's reliance on electricity to run pumps and other equipment. The head of Ukraine's law enforcement said Monday's attacks damaged 70 infrastructure sites, of which 29 are critical. Zelenskyy said that of the 84 cruise missiles and 24 drones Russia fired, Ukrainian forces shot down 56. Andriy Yermak, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the strikes had no ""practical military sense"" and that Russia's goal was to cause a ""humanitarian catastrophe."" Russian President Vladimir Putin said his forces used ""precision weapons"" to target key energy infrastructure and military command facilities in retaliation for Kyiv's ""terrorist"" actions — a reference to Ukraine's attempts to repel Moscow's invasion forces, including an attack Saturday on a key bridge between Russia and the annexed Crimean Peninsula that Putin called a ""terrorist act"" masterminded by Ukrainian special services. Putin vowed a ""tough"" and ""proportionate"" response should Ukraine carry out further attacks that threaten Russia's security. ""No one should have any doubts about it,"" he told Russia's Security Council by video. The explosions in Kyiv and other cities came just a day after Putin blamed Kyiv for the massive explosion on a 12-mile bridge connecting Crimea with Russia. Crimea is a large Ukrainian peninsula that Russia occupied and then unilaterally annexed eight years ago during a previous invasion. The annexation of that territory, like Putin's recent land grab of four Ukrainian regions that he declared Russian soil last week, have been condemned as illegitimate and illegal by Ukraine, the United Nations, the U.S. and other countries. The blast that hit the bridge sparked celebrations among Ukrainians and others on social media — but officials in Kyiv have made no direct claim of responsibility. The Russian president has been under intense domestic pressure to take more aggressive action to stop a largely successful Ukrainian counteroffensive and to react forcefully to Saturday's attack on the Kerch bridge, whose construction he used to cement his 2014 annexation of Crimea. Putin's increasingly frequent descriptions of Ukraine's actions as terrorist could portend even more bold and draconian actions. But in Monday's speech, Putin — whose partial troop mobilization order last month triggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of men of fighting age from Russia — stopped short of an expected escalation from what he calls a ""special military operation"" to a counterterrorism campaign or martial law. Zelenskyy has repeatedly called on world leaders to declare Russia a terrorist state because of its attacks on civilians and alleged war crimes. Zelenskyy emerged onto a street in Kyiv on Monday to record a selfie video with a message to his people and the world, denouncing Russia for the barrage of missiles which he said had targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, and its civilians. Zelenskyy's wife, Olena, posted a video showing people sheltering on the stairs of a Kyiv subway station singing a Ukrainian folk song, ""In a Cherry Garden,"" whose final lines are: ""My dear mother, you are old and I'm happy and young. I want to live, to love."" ""They have specifically chosen such a time and such targets to cause as much damage as possible,"" the president said. ""But we Ukrainians, we help each other, believe in ourselves, rebuild everything. Now the shortages of electricity may occur, but not the shortage of our defiance and our confidence in our victory."" The strikes sent residents of Ukraine's two largest cities — Kyiv and Kharkiv — into bomb shelters, including subway stations. While air raid sirens have continued throughout the war in cities across the country, in Kyiv and elsewhere many Ukrainians had begun to ignore their warnings after months of calm. Just as traffic was picking up Monday morning, a commuter minibus was struck near Kyiv National University. Nearby, at least one strike landed in Shevchenko Park, leaving a large hole near a children's playground. Another target was the Klitschko pedestrian bridge — a landmark in central Kyiv with glass panels. Closed-circuit video footage showed a huge explosion under the bridge, with smoke rising, and a man running away after the blast, apparently unhurt. No significant damage to the bridge was immediately apparent. Air raid sirens sounded in every region of Ukraine except Russia-annexed Crimea for four straight hours. Videos posted on social media showed black smoke rising above several areas of the city. Russia's last strike on the capital was on June 26. Associated Press journalists saw multiple bodies at an industrial site on the outskirts of Dnipro. Four people were killed and 19 injured in the city, officials said. Witnesses said one missile landed in front of a bus during the morning rush hour, damaging the vehicle but not killing any passengers. Kharkiv was hit three times, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. The strikes knocked out the electricity and water supply. Energy infrastructure was also hit in Lviv, regional Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi said. Three cruise missiles launched against Ukraine from Russian ships in the Black Sea crossed Moldova's airspace, said the country's foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu. As the European Union condemned Russia's attack and said the targeting of civilians amounted to ""a war crime,"" Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed the ""massive strike with long-range precision weapons."" It claimed the missiles had targeted ""objects of the military command and control, communications and energy systems of Ukraine"" and that ""all assigned objects were hit."" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was ""deeply shocked by today's large-scale missile attacks"" on Ukraine, his spokesman said in a statement, adding that the strike ""constitutes another unacceptable escalation of the war and, as always, civilians are paying the highest price."" Some feared Monday's attacks may just be the first salvo in a renewed Russian offensive. As a precautionary measure, Ukraine switched all schools to online learning until at least the end of this week. In an ominous move, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced Monday that he and Putin have agreed to create a joint ""regional grouping of troops."" He offered no details. Lukashenko repeated his claims that Ukraine is plotting an attack on Belarus, sparking fears he would take preemptive action. His defense minister, Viktor Khrenin, later issued a video warning Ukraine not to provoke Belarus, but added, ""We don't want to fight.""

2022-10-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/seattle/news/airport-websites-hacked-pro-russia-ddos-attack/,U.S. airport websites knocked offline in apparent pro-Russia hacking attack,"An apparently coordinated denial-of-service attack organized by pro-Russia hackers rendered the websites of some major U.S. airports unreachable early Monday, though officials said flights were not affected. The attacks — in which participants flood targets with junk data — were orchestrated by a shadowy group that calls itself Killnet. On the eve of the attacks the group published a target list on its Telegram channel. While highly visible and aimed at maximum psychological impact, DDoS attacks are mostly a noisy nuisance, different from hacking that involves breaking into networks and can do serious damage. ""We noticed this morning that the external website was down, and our IT and security people are in the process of investigating,"" said Andrew Gobeil, a spokesman for Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. ""There has been no impact on operations."" Portions of the public-facing side of the Los Angeles International Airport website were also disrupted, spokeswoman Victoria Spilabotte said. ""No internal airport systems were compromised and there were no operational disruptions."" Spilabotte said the airport notified the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration, and the airport's information-technology team was working to restore all services and investigate the cause. Several other airports that were included on Killnet's target list reported problems with their websites. Orlando International Airport told CBS News that its site was affected but is back online and that airport operations were not impacted. The Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement that websites for O'Hare International and Midway airports went offline early Monday but that no airport operations were affected. ""Early Monday, FlyChicago.com and related websites for O'Hare and Midway international airports went offline. No airport operations were affected. City of Chicago IT staff worked diligently to restore the website's functionality shortly after noon CT, and they continue to vigilantly monitor the situation. The City's Information Security Office at the Department of Assets, Information and Services is investigating the cause of the outage,"" the department said in a statement. Last week, the same group of hackers claimed responsibility for denial-of-service attacks on state government websites in several states. John Hultquist, vice president for threat intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, tweeted that denial-of-service attacks like those aimed at the airports and state governments are usually short in duration and ""typically superficial."" ""These are not the serious impacts that have kept us awake,"" he said. Such attacks instead tend to reveal insufficient attention by webmasters to adequate bulletproofing of sites, which now includes DDoS protection service.",20,5.396445423347202,1.8279762278150526,3.568469195532149,15

An FBI spokesperson confirmed they were aware of the cyberattack that took down flychicago.com for part of the morning on Monday, but would not confirm or deny if they were investigating. The O'Hare and Midway websites were down for at least a few hours Monday morning, but was back up and running early Monday afternoon. The Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement that no airport operations were affected. ""City of Chicago IT staff worked diligently to restore the website's functionality shortly after noon CT, and they continue to vigilantly monitor the situation,"" the department said in the statement. ""The City's Information Security Office at the Department of Assets, Information and Services is investigating the cause of the outage."" CNN reports Russian-speaking hackers claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against more than a dozen airport websites, including Los Angeles International Airport. No immediate signs of impact to actual air travel were reported, suggesting the issue may be an inconvenience for people seeking travel information. ""Obviously, we're tracking that, and there's no concern about operations being disrupted,"" Kiersten Todt, Chief of Staff of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said Monday at a security conference in Sea Island, Georgia. The 14 websites include the one for Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. An employee there told CNN there were no operational impacts. The Los Angeles International Airport website was offline earlier but appeared to be restored shortly before 9 a.m. Eastern. A spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment. The hacking group known as Killnet listed multiple US airports as targets. It stepped up activity to target organizations in NATO countries after Russia's February invasion of Ukraine. The loosely organized ""hacktivists"" are politically motivated to support the Kremlin but ties to Moscow are unknown. The group claimed responsibility last week for knocking offline US state governments websites. Killnet is blamed for briefly downing a US Congress website in July and for cyberattacks on organizations in Lithuania after the country blocked shipment of goods to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad in June. The type of cyberattack used by Killnet is known as ""distributed denial of service"" (DDoS), in which hackers flood computer servers with phony web traffic to knock them offline. ""DDoS attacks are favored by actors of varying sophistication because they have visible results, but these incidents are usually superficial and short lived,"" John Hultquist, a vice president at Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told CNN. A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said the agency is monitoring the issue and working with airport partners. With less than a month until Election Day, Prof. Bill Kresse of Governors State University said governments and businesses should be doubling down by protecting against breaches and online phishing scams that allow hackers into vulnerable areas. He said the attacks were a message to allies of Ukraine to ""back off."" ""It could be interpreted that they don't want to do anything major that might cause major repercussions, but this is something which will be noticed,"" Kresse said. ""It was really more signaling than anything else ... The message we should take from this: playtime's over. It's time we really take our precautions seriously.""",20,4.632032066131067,2.126484541069333,2.5055475250617345,15

According to officials, U.S. special operations forces conducted a raid near the village of Qamishli, killing IS insurgent Rakkan Wahid al Shamman, wounding another and capturing two others. Later Thursday, the U.S. conducted an airstrike in northern Syria, killing Abu Ala, the No. 2 Islamic State leader in Syria, and Abu Mu'ad al Qahtani, another IS leader, officials said. A U.S. official said a small number of U.S. troops were on the ground near Qamishli for less than an hour to conduct the ground raid. The U.S. doesn't often do missions on territory that is under the control of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the raid. In a statement, U.S. Central Command said al Shamman was known to facilitate the smuggling of weapons and fighters in support of Islamic State operations. According to the statement, no civilians or U.S. troops or were killed or injured in the raid. Additional information about the airstrike was not provided. The U.S. continues to have about 900 forces in Syria to advise and assist Syrian Democratic Forces in the fight against the Islamic State group. One U.S. official said that, for the first time in a long time, the U.S. did not use its deconfliction phone line with Russia to notify them of the U.S. troop raid and presence there. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details, said the lack of deconfliction was more the result of operational security and not a reaction to Russia's war on Ukraine. The U.S. and Russia have used the deconfliction line to avoid any possible accidents or incidents when U.S. forces are in the northeastern region of Syria where Russian forces also operate.",7,5.973784572837961,4.082788753021495,1.8909958198164665,25

""Governor Polis basically said look beware there are folks who are interested because of our active participation in the sanctions we can expect to be attacked,"" said Beaty. In February Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order impacting the Russian Consul, reviewing any state contracts with Russian ties, and protecting against cyber attacks. ""We're committed to making sure the state of Colorado is not in any way empowering the regime of Vladimir Putin of Russia and we are looking to take every additional step we can to penalize Putin,"" said Polis at the time. Now news reports attribute the attack on Colorado to Russian speakers.

""Today, right now, it seems a similar attack to this particular group of Russian hackers who call themselves Killnet."" With Colorado and other states hit there is a concern nationally about the coming elections. The website was restored on Thursday and running as usual.

Nineteen of those bodies belonged to children and 226 were women, he said. The count includes remains that were found in shallow graves last month at a mass burial site in Izyum, where hundreds of corpses were discovered after Russian troops were forced out of the area by a Ukrainian counter-offensive. Bolvinov said authorities identified 22 sites that Russian troops used as torture chambers when they were occupying the area. ""In almost all the big towns and settlements where the soldiers of the Russian army were based, they arranged these locations for detaining civilians and prisoners of war, where they got tortured,"" Bolvinov said. ""The most common type of torture is connecting wires to shock someone's body, and causing pain by that. Severe beatings with sticks and other items. There is also evidence of the nails being removed and other horrible things, including usage of a gas-mask to stifle breathing."" He said the most recent torture chamber to be discovered by Ukrainian investigators in the region had been continuously manned by about 10 soldiers. It was in the basement of a house in Pisky-Radkivski, a village near where Russian troops positioned their headquarters. Ukrainian detainees, who were captured for — among other things — breaking curfew or being accused of spotting for Ukrainian attacks, were held and tortured in that basement, which was about 8 feet long by 5 feet wide. ""We have witnesses who are giving us information on the fact that they heard people screaming, begging for help, to be let out, and sometimes people asked to go to the toilet from this basement,"" Bolvinov said. ""Sometimes, after these screams, the locals heard gunshots, and the screams stopped after that."" In the basement, investigators found blindfolds, ropes, a dildo, military jackets, written notes of prisoner ""confessions,"" a telephone, a gas mask, and a plastic container full of dentures and teeth. The teeth have been sent to be DNA profiled, to identify who they belong to and determine whether they were taken from a local dentist.

2022-10-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/tampa/news/russia-ukraine-war-putin-elites-critical-and-looking-for-scapegoats/,"Russia's elites are increasingly critical of the war in Ukraine, and they're looking for scapegoats","Cracks are emerging in the solid base of support within Russia's political elite for President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. As Russia's forces suffer setback after setback and a botched and highly unpopular military mobilization effort draws thousands of poorly trained men to serve on the front lines, senior military and political figures have been looking for scapegoats, and the blame game is getting closer than ever to Putin himself. Criticism of Moscow's military strategy and the way decisions are being made and implemented on the ground has brewed for weeks on social media channels popular among pro-war Russian military correspondents. This week, however, it reached a new level. General Andrey Kartapolov, who held a range of senior positions in Russia's Defense Ministry until he became a member of parliament and head of its defense committee a few years ago, has lashed out at the country's current military commanders over losses in the war. ""First of all, you have to stop lying,"" Kartapolov, who previously commanded the Western Military District, which is central to the Ukraine invasion, said on a popular online video show run by a top Kremlin propagandist. ""All border villages of the Belgorod region are practically destroyed,"" Kartapolov lamented, referring to settlements right on the Ukrainian border that have been caught in the crossfire as Russia uses the area as a staging ground for its attacks. ""We hear about this from anyone, from governors and military correspondents. But the reports of the Ministry of Defense do not change,"" the politician said. ""The people know. Our people are not stupid, they see they are not telling them the truth and this can lead to loss of credibility."" Casting blame at Russia's top brass, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu who, at least in the past, has been considered a close friend and confidant of Putin, has become a central theme on Russian television and in public forums. Direct criticism of Putin himself still appears to be off-limits on Russia's closely monitored and tightly controlled airwaves, and pro-Kremlin voices have been working hard to shelter the autocrat from the public discontent. But infighting between various political clans does seem to be disrupting the carved-in-stone hierarchy Putin has relied on to remain in power — and to quickly quash any inkling of dissent — for more than two decades. A week ago, Russian troops were forced out of the Ukrainian city of Lyman. Retaking the railway hub in the Donetsk region deprived Russia of a crucial logistics hub and gave Ukraine's forces a route to attack the Russian occupied Luhansk region. Shortly after Lyman fell to Ukrainian forces, the powerful head of the Russian region of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, unleashed a sneering attack on the Russian military's General Staff, which leads the military campaign, and on Alexander Lapin, who Kadyrov said was responsible for that sector of the front line. ""The shame isn't that Lapin is talentless,"" Kadyrov wrote on his blog on the Telegram messaging app. ""It's that he's being shielded from above by the leadership in the General Staff."" ""If it was up to me, I would demote him down to a private, take away his medals and send him with a rifle to the front in order to cleanse his shame in blood,"" Kadyrov added. The proxy leader installed by Russia in the largely-occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, went even further, issuing rare scathing criticism of Defense Minister Shoigu over Moscow's recent military losses, including in Kherson. ""Many are saying that the Defense Minister — who allowed things to come to this — should simply shoot himself like a [real] officer,"" Stremousov said in a four-minute video posted Thursday to his Telegram channel. Russia's botched military mobilization campaign — which has seen the blind, elderly and others incapable of fighting among those to receive summons to fight — has been another major point of public criticism. Tens of thousands of people, mostly young men, have fled the country to avoid being sent to fight in Ukraine, and hundreds have been arrested at anti-mobilization protests around the country. Those who have reported for duty have faced shortages of protective gear and other basics, including food and uniforms. ""I'm perplexed how a current training site of the Ministry of Defense can be in such a state. A ruined canteen, broken and rusty showers, lack of beds, and those that exist are broken,"" Roman Starovoit, Governor of the Kursk region that borders Ukraine, said Wednesday after a tour of military training grounds there, some of which he described as ""terrible."" Bloomberg has reported, citing sources, that the sudden abundance of public acknowledgement over the Russian military's failures in Ukraine is actually the result of a Kremlin directive. The report suggests the Kremlin told some trusted state media outlets to start acknowledging the failures, fearing an overly-positive message on Russian airwaves would fuel public doubts about its credibility. Putin has also reportedly met with pro-war military correspondents and bloggers who have spent months on the ground, and have been offering more realistic battleground updates. Some of these journalists have reportedly wondered whether the Russian president had been relying solely on the rosy public briefings provided by his Ministry of Defense. ""The idea that Russia will inevitably prevail has started to be overshadowed by doubt over what price Russia is prepared to pay in order to bring Ukraine to heel,"" political analyst and nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment Tatiana Stanovaya said in a recent analysis. ""Matters have progressed so far that they may now have to choose among various losing scenarios. That makes Putin far more vulnerable, for he may just find that he and the elites settle on different scenarios.""",7,4.734020325522406,4.683688273912405,0.05033205161000076,7

The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and the Children's Hospital Association wrote to Garland on Monday. Their demands come amid a spate of threats against doctors and institutions that provide medical care for transgender kids, sometimes including hormones or surgery for older teens. Children's hospitals nationwide have substantially increased security and are working with law enforcement, while some providers now need constant security, the associations said. Garland did not immediately comment publicly, and a spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday. Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said this summer that the Department of Justice will ensure equal protection of transgender people under the law. Rollins said she would not let ""hate-based criminal activity"" continue in her district after Boston Children's Hospital said in August that its doctors and other staffers were being threatened with violence over its surgical program for transgender youths. The hospital is home to the first pediatric and adolescent transgender health program in the United States. Other U.S. children's hospitals were also being harassed online. The medical associations said in their letter that the social media threats have continued, coupled with harassing emails, phone calls and protesters at health care sites, causing ""elevated and justifiable fear among families, patients and staff."" One hospital's neonatal intensive care unit went on lockdown because of a bomb threat, they said. ""From Boston to Akron to Nashville to Seattle, children's hospitals, academic health systems and physicians are being targeted and threatened for providing evidence-based health care,"" the letter states. ""These attacks have not only made it difficult and dangerous for institutions and practices to provide this care, they have also disrupted many other services to families seeking care."" The AMA and the AAP are two of the nation's most influential physician groups, helping shape government policy at the national level and in doctors' offices. The CHA represents more than 220 hospitals serving kids nationwide. Laws and proposed legislation in several states seeking to limit kids' access to transgender care or criminalize doctors and parents who seek it have emboldened attacks by popular conservative Twitter accounts. Some tweets have misled their large followings about the procedures for gender-affirming care. Boston Children's became the focus of far-right social media accounts, news outlets and bloggers after they found informational YouTube videos published by the hospital about surgical offerings for transgender patients. The medical associations argue that the attacks are rooted in an ""intentional campaign of disinformation."" While Americans agree that online disinformation is a problem, there is widespread apprehension around federal efforts to monitor domestic, online disinformation, with privacy and free speech advocates expressing concerns about the government impinging on free speech rights. Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security, for example, launched and then quickly shuttered a Disinformation Governance Board that had been intended to counter falsehoods that foreign adversaries, such as Russia, try to pump into the social media feeds of Americans.",20,4.418840201334001,5.249483629271133,-0.8306434279371313,12

""So this is an area that I think Congress needs take a hard look at, are the right deterrence measures in place from criminal statutes,"" Krebs continued. ""And then do we have the investigation techniques? It is, you know, I personally have received a significant number of death threats and other-other threats. And some of them come in through anonymous- through anonymous means like protonmail. We do need more attention on these threats. Otherwise, we're going to see a shortage of election workers."" — Nicole Sganga contributed to this report",20,4.923521222306302,4.330891115658846,0.592630106647456,29
2022-10-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/classified-documents-secret-top-secret/,Classified: Keeping close the nation's secrets,"The documents spread out on the carpet at Mar-a-Lago, their classification markings clearly visible, are tiny drops in a tsunami of secrets kept by the U.S. government. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin asked John Fitzpatrick, who managed the flow of classified documents in both the Obama and Trump White Houses, ""Do you have any estimate of how many classified documents there are?"" ""That's really unknowable,"" he replied. Fitzpatrick said the last reliable count was taken when most classified documents existed only on paper. ""They were in the tens of millions of documents a year,"" he said. ""Has it become easier or harder to classify information?"" asked Martin. ""As a practical matter, it has become easier. The proliferation of classified computer networks provides an environment where the proliferation of classified material increases."" The 9/11 attacks and all the subsequent alarms of terrorist plots against the homeland brought with them a surge of classification, which even worries the person in charge of keeping secrets, national intelligence director Avril Haines, who testified to Congress that overclassification is a national security problem. Earlier this year, she wrote, ""Deficiencies in the current classification system undermine our national security,"" by making it difficult to share information with allies and the public."" ""It's a fairly arresting statement,"" said Martin. ""The system designed to keep national security secrets is undermining national security?"" ""I agree with her,"" said Fitzpatrick. ""There's a culture of classification: Protecting secrets is always better than releasing secrets. It's a false binary, but it's the way people do it."" Tom Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, said, ""Most secrecy is not about real damage. It's about preventing one form of embarrassment or another by the government."" For the past 35 years, the National Security Archive has used the Freedom of Information Act to pry loose boxes upon boxes of previously-classified document. ""We've seen probably on the order of 10 to 20 million pages of declassified U.S. government documents over the years,"" Blanton said. The walls are lined with some of his favorites. He showed one to Martin: ""It's a piece of internal CIA email about the torture program, and specifically about how they destroyed the videotapes of the water boarding."" If tapes of the CIA's waterboarding of captured al Qaida operative Abu Zubaidah ever became public, the memo said, ""they would make us look terrible; it would be 'devastating' for us."" Blanton said, ""This document would have stayed classified indefinitely under the CIA's sources and methods protection."" ""Do you file Freedom of Information Acts requests on a daily basis?"" ""About 1,500 a year."" ""How many people are there out there who can classify documents?"" ""Almost 5 million."" Today's classification system grew out of the secret project to build the atom bomb, arguably the greatest secret ever. The head of the project, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, later wrote he was keeping it secret from ""the Germans,"" ""the Japanese,"" ""the Russians,"" ""all other nations,"" and ""those who would interfere,"" which included Congress. ""What General Groves created in the national security classification system was a big bang, and that universe is still expanding,"" said Blanton. The three basic levels of classification are confidential, secret and top secret. Confidential information would cause ""damage"" to the national security if it got out; secret would cause ""serious damage""; and top secret ""exceptionally grave damage."" Beyond top secret there is SCI (which stands for sensitive compartmented information, also known as special access programs). ""Those are considered the most closely held secrets of the government,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""Do you have any idea how many Special Access Programs there are?"" asked Martin. ""Ultimately, you're talking about hundreds,"" he replied. Each special access program has its own code name. Here's a once-top secret memo directing that ""satellite photographs must be handled in a separate compartment known as TALENT-KEYHOLE."" A document like this would be kept in a room called a SCIF, or sensitive compartmented information facility. ""There are physical standards for locking them, for alarming them, and soundproofing them,"" Fitzpatrick said. The best known SCIF is the White House Situation Room, where the president meets with his national security advisors. All the presidential libraries are equipped with SCIFs, but there is no SCIF at Mar-a-Largo. Martin asked, ""Does the President of the United States have a security clearance?"" ""The answer is no,"" said Fitzpatrick. ""The president derives his authority to see any classified information from his constitutional authorities."" ""Is it assumed that the president has a need to know absolutely everything?"" ""It is."" ""Can the President just flat out order a document to be declassified?"" ""Yes. The president's authority to classify or declassify information is derived from his own constitutional authority."" When he was president, Donald Trump declassified the transcript of his phone call with Ukraine's President Zelensky asking for help in digging up dirt on Hunter Biden. All of its original classification markings have been crossed out and it is clearly stamped ""unclassified."" Compare that with the documents the FBI spread out on the floor after their search of Mar-a-Largo. ""There's not a line through those markings,"" said Blanton. ""There's not a stamp saying, 'This was released on X-date, authority of somebody.' Even when the president says, 'I want something declassified,' there's a whole process it has to go through."" Most documents are not declassified until long after they have been shipped to a presidential library, like the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas, where all the papers of his administration are stored – and where, more than half a century later, some still remain classified. Blanton recently asked the George W. Bush Library to declassify the notes of the president's prep sessions for his first meeting with Vladimir Putin in 2001: ""Great moment in history. You know, this is 22 years ago, when Putin was still our friend. Might even do us some good today in figuring out Putin's grievances, and maybe some off-ramps out of this current tragedy in Ukraine that Putin started."" The National Security Archive filed its FOIA request in January of this year. ""Nice people down at the George W. Bush Library in Dallas said, 'Sorry to tell you, Mr. Blanton, but it's going to be 12 years before they get around to it.'"" Martin asked, ""Which side is winning? The forces of classification, or the forces of declassification?"" ""Oh, the forces of classification have long won!"" Blanton replied. For more info: Story produced by Mary Walsh.

Wearing a blue shirt and a black beard, Dalke, 30, did not flinch when Magistrate Reid Neureiter informed him the maximum penalty if convicted is life in prison or death. It was a clandestine operation that played out in the lower part of Denver's downtown, at Union Station, on Corinth Street and in Colorado Springs on Wednesday. Dalke is accused of trying to pass national defense secrets to a foreign country. Unsealed court documents reveal Dalke is a former employee of the National Security Agency and was previously in the US Army as a private. He thought he was dealing with an agent for Russia according to the FBI in an affidavit for an arrest warrant presented to a federal magistrate. The documents Dalke is accused of wanting to pass in exchange for more than $80,000 were highly secretive classified defense information. He is quoted by the FBI as saying ""There is an opportunity to help balance scales of the world while also tending to my own needs."" He indicated his own ethnic background is tied to that country. Investigators decided Dalke was their suspect because he was the only one who had printed out all three of the documents presented to an undercover FBI agent posing as a foreign agent. Legal Analyst Karen Steinhauser told CBS News Colorado the Espionage Act dates back to World War I and the penalty of death is intended to send a message, ""The idea is to prevent individuals from cooperating from giving documents that could interfere with United States security to foreign powers."" The Colorado Rangers, which is a group that assists police, acknowledge that Dalke was a member of its organization. Chief Ronald Abramson said Dalke is suspended pending resolution of the case. He also said Dalke identified himself as a lieutenant with the digital crimes unit, but no such unit exists. Dalke is a sergeant and leads a small team of reserve officers. Abramson said Dalke has assisted Monument and Woodland Park police departments in the past. Chief Abramson added, ""We are enormously disappointed in the allegations but we have to wait for the federal process to run its course."" A home listed to Dalke's address in Colorado Springs was searched as part of the operation. FBI agents could be seen entering and leaving the home on Wednesday. Dalke is due back in federal court on Oct. 5 for a detention hearing.",20,5.067550002854911,4.1697268854600145,0.8978231173948963,12

Jareh Sebastian Dalke, 30, was scheduled to appear in federal court in Denver on Thursday afternoon on charges of attempting to transmit national defense information to an officer or agent of a foreign government. He was charged last month, but court documents were only made public this week. They indicate Dalke sent classified documents to an ""FBI Online Covert Employee"" in exchange for money. Dalke believed that FBI employee was a foreign government representative. He's accused of attempting to send classified documents to the Russian SVR, or Foreign Intelligence Service. The FBI says Dalke was a volunteer with the Colorado Rangers, a reserve law enforcement agency, and a former employee of the U.S. National Security Agency. Dalke, in his resume, described himself as a lieutenant and commander of the digital crimes unit of the Colorado Rangers, according to court documents. Colonel Ronald M Abramson, agency chief for the Colorado Rangers, confirmed to CBS News Colorado that Dalke had been associated with the Rangers' reserve force, which has a little over 70 reserve officers. Dalke started working with the Rangers in 2019 after passing a full background check and psychological evaluation. ""We are enormously disappointed in the allegations but we have to wait for the federal process to run its course,"" he told CBS News Colorado. He said his agency is learning of this at the same time everyone else is. Dalke is suspended, pending a resolution of the case. Dalke identified himself as a lieutenant of their digital crimes unit but no such unit exists, according to Abramson. He went on to say that Dalke is a sergeant who lead a small team of reserve officers. Dalke was based in Colorado Springs and had done work for Monument Police and Woodland Park Police in the past. In his communications with the FBI's undercover employee, Dalke allegedly reached out to what he thought was a Russian agent, saying he, ""recently learned that my heritage ties back to your country, which is part of why I have come to you."" He goes on to explain his reasoning for wanting to share documents from the NSA and at least two other American federal agencies, saying he, ""questioned our role in damage to the world in the past and by mixture of curiosity for secrets and a desire to cause change."" Some of the material Dalke is accused of sending was unclassified, but others were labeled ""secret"" and ""top secret,"" according to court documents. Some of them are specifically labeled ""NOFORN,"" meaning sending them to non-US citizens is prohibited by federal law. The NSA did an internal audit to find who accessed the documents that were sent to the undercover FBI agent, and its audit determined that Dalke was the only employee, according to the FBI. Dalke could face the death penalty or life in prison if convicted. Both the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on the case Thursday.",20,1.645727412941648,5.529664506577242,-3.883937093635594,12
2022-09-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/seattle/news/ukraine-war-us-military-aid-himars/,U.S. announces $1.1 billion more in military aid for Ukraine,"Washington — The U.S. will provide an additional $1.1 billion in aid to Ukraine, with funding for about 18 more advanced rocket systems and other weapons to counter drones that Russia has been using against Ukrainian troops, the Biden administration announced Wednesday. The latest package is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which funds contracts to purchase weapons and equipment. And it brings the total of U.S. aid to Ukraine to nearly $17 billion since the Biden administration took office. The aid announcement comes as Russia moves to annex parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine that held Kremlin-orchestrated referendums on living under Moscow's rule. The votes were denounced by Kyiv and the West as illegal and rigged. ""We will not be deterred from supporting Ukraine, we will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people, and provide them with the security assistance they need to defend themselves, for as long as it takes,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Since the funding is for contracts for weapons and equipment, it is aimed at helping Ukraine secure its longer-term defense needs. It could take a year or two for Ukraine to get the systems. The U.S. has used Pentagon drawdown authority to provide weapons more immediately, and another announcement for that Defense Department aid is expected early next week. The package includes funding for 18 of the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, and ammunition for them, and 12 Titan systems, which are used to counter drones. Officials have said the HIMARS and other similar systems were key to Ukraine's battle successes in recent weeks. And the Russians have been using Iranian-made drones to target Ukrainian forces, underscoring the need for more systems to counter that threat. Also in the package is funding for about 300 vehicles, dozens of trucks and trailers to transport heavy equipment, a variety of radars, communications and surveillance equipment, and other gear for soldiers. It also will include funding for equipment to detect explosives and for maintenance and training. The war, now in its seventh month, has shifted to a new phase, as Russia tries to rebound from recent combat losses and use the referendums to politically solidify the gains it had made in the four occupied regions in the south and east. Pro-Russia officials in Ukraine's Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions said Wednesday they would ask Russian President Vladimir Putin to incorporate their provinces into Russia. It wasn't immediately clear how the administrative process would unfold. Jean-Pierre said the U.S. has determined that Russia falsified the results of the referendums, which it said showed overwhelming support for annexation. ""These so called referenda have been an exercise in coercion and disinformation, executed by puppet authorities following orders from Russia,"" she said. Jean-Pierre signaled that the White House was preparing new sanctions against Russia in response to the referendums, saying the U.S. and its allies planned to impose a ""severe economic cost on Russia when they move forward with annexation.""",49,7.242161011362518,5.746413553548532,1.4957474578139864,5

""There were some significant impacts,"" said Amanda Harrison, a spokeswoman for Wheat Ridge. ""We are working with sophisticated foreign agents from eastern Europe or Russia,"" she told CBS4. The Wheat Ridge hack was discovered on Aug. 29 causing the city to take down its phone and email systems, some payment systems and police records have not been immediately available to the public, according to Harrison. She said the attackers have captured some city data but, ""the investigation into what data they took from our system is still being investigated."" The FBI and state of Colorado have assisted in addressing the hack. While the hackers demanded $5 million in ransom, the city has opted not to pay any ransom, choosing to try to circumvent the attack and restore network systems on their own. Harrison said city staffers and IT consultants have been able to restore most services and citizens likely aren't noticing any change. The city said it does not believe the hackers got into the system through a city employee error, but computer security is being beefed up, said Harrison. The attackers utilized BlackCat ransomware, which is the same ransomware that was deployed in Fremont County in southern Colorado on Aug. 17. Fremont County Emergency Manager Mykel Kroll was blunt in his assessment of what the hackers have done: ""Everything was impacted. I hope we never have to go through this again."" He told CBS4 no ransom has been paid in the data breach but he said personal information for some county employees and members of the public might have been seized by the hackers. The Fremont County Sheriff's Office says some jail inmate data ""has been deemed unrecoverable."" The county website was taken down and Kroll said supply chain issues were slowing the effort to get everything back up and running. Vikki Migoya with the Denver FBI field office said she could not discuss either of the recent cyber attacks. ""The FBI cannot comment on specific incidents, but I can say that FBI Denver routinely advises both public and private-sector organizations and businesses about cyber threats.

Ron DeSantis on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at governments in China, Iran, Russia, Cuba and ""others hostile to American interests,"" as he pointed to concerns about issues such as cybersecurity. DeSantis, who is running for re-election in November, said he also will ask lawmakers in 2023 to make changes in state law that would further block business activities in Florida by those governments. ""I think we've stood strong against this type of ideology in a variety of ways, and this just continues us on that course,"" DeSantis said during an event at Miami Dade College's Wolfson Campus that focused heavily on China. The executive order, in part, bars the state and local governments from procuring or using technology services that any federal agency has prohibited based on national-security concerns. The order also directs the state Department of Management Services to take steps to ensure commodities and services used by the state and local governments are not susceptible to exploitation by ""foreign countries of concern."" ""This will prevent the exposure of Floridians' personal information and technology systems in Florida to foreign entities and bad actors,"" DeSantis said. DeSantis said he wants lawmakers to prevent the targeted countries from being able to purchase agricultural land in Florida and land surrounding military bases. DeSantis' office cited ""instances of Chinese Communist Party-affiliated companies purchasing land near military bases in other states, including Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota."" DeSantis also wants to expand a 2021 law that created new reporting requirements for entities seeking grants or contracts from the state. The law requires state agencies and universities to report receiving gifts or grants ""from any foreign source"" valued at $50,000 or more. DeSantis wants to revise the law to bar gifts to Florida colleges and universities from residents, governments or other entities in countries of concern. Lawmakers approved changes in 2021 after high-profile Florida cases involving medical and academic researchers. Among the other changes, people ""trafficking in trade secrets"" would face second-degree felony charges for ""trafficking in trade secrets,"" with the charges raised to first-degree felonies if foreign governments benefited. Lawmakers also required people and entities seeking state grants or contracts of more than $100,000 to disclose contracts, donations or grants linking them to China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela and Syria.

Vladimir Osechkin, who leads the Gulagu.net NGO that specializes in uncovering abuses in Russian prisons, is a refugee in France and is based in the resort town of Biarritz on its southwest coast. Osechkin, an avowed opponent of President Vladimir Putin, said he was targeted on the evening of September 12 when he was at home with his wife and children and working in the dark. ""I noticed a moving red dot on the railing of one of the terraces and then moving towards me on the wall,"" he told AFP by telephone. ""We turned off the light, lay down on the floor, closed the shutters and called the police."" He added that police and neighbors had heard shots were fired. Osechkin said he had been informed in February of an assassination plot against him and was subsequently put under police protection. He added that 10 days ago, he had also received information that a ""Russian criminal world boss"" had arrived in France on a mission to kill people in the Biarritz area. A source close to the investigation, who asked not to be named, told AFP that a probe had been opened into ""threats"" and not into attempted murder. The source declined to confirm or deny that shots had been fired. Gulagu.net rose to prominence in 2021 after publishing videos showing rapes in Russian prisons, as well as testimonies from victims and, extremely unusually, from the perpetrators, leading to the opening of an investigation by the authorities. Osechkin told the BBC that the protocol followed by the alleged torturers suggests they are well-practiced. ""They are giving signs to each other, acting in silent concert, understanding each other even without words because they are following a well-established system,"" he said. Gulagu.net claims to have more than 1,000 videos showing torture in Russian jails. ""We have gathered overwhelming evidence that proves instances of torture in Russia have been set up literally by the intelligent services, that these instances of torture were systematic,"" Osechkin told Reuters last year. Activists and Western governments accuse Russia of being prepared to eliminate opponents abroad, such as the double agent Sergei Skripal, who survived an attempt to kill him with the nerve agent Novichok in 2018.

The White House said it was the 21st time that the Defense Department has pulled weapons and other equipment off the shelves to deliver to Ukraine. The package will include more of the same types of ammunition and equipment that have helped Ukrainian forces beat back the Russian forces in portions of the east and south. ""With admirable grit and determination, the people of Ukraine are defending their homeland and fighting for their future,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. ""The capabilities we are delivering are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield and strengthen Ukraine's hand at the negotiating table when the time is right,"" he said in a statement. The decision to move on new aid quickly — on the heels of a nearly $2.9 billion infusion of aid and financing support announced last week, and more than $3 billion announced in late August — underscore the U.S. intent to ensure that Ukraine can sustain its stunning counterattack that was launched early this month. That most recent funding included $2.2 billion in long-term military financing announced that Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced during a visit to Ukraine last week, and a $675 million weapons package announced by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Europe that same day. The $2.2 billion that Blinken announced in Kyiv is for Ukraine and 18 of its neighbors, including NATO members and regional security partners, that are potentially at risk of future Russian aggression, the U.S. said. Moscow's recent rout in northeast Ukraine was its largest military defeat since the withdrawal of Russian troops from areas near Kyiv more than five months ago. The latest package of weapons systems brings the total amount of U.S. aid to Ukraine to nearly $15.9 billion since President Joe Biden took office. U.S. officials watching the counteroffensive have been careful not to declare a premature victory, noting that Russia still has substantial troops and resources. And they are wary of what Russian President Vladimir Putin may do to turn the tide.

The town was just recently liberated by Ukraine, and it was discovered that so many people were killed so quickly that hundreds were buried in shallow mass graves – including at least one entire family. CBS News foreign correspondent Debora Patta visited the site on Friday, where she learned that the makeshift cemetery included those who were killed by shelling. Others buried had been executed, including some, according to Reuters, who were buried still with rope around their necks and their hands tied. Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a video posted to Telegram on Friday that among those buried is ""a whole family"" – a mother and father in their 30s, their parents, and their 5- or 6-year-old daughter. The family's remains are marked with plywood crosses and small yellow and purple flowers planted in the dirt that covers them. ""We have testimony from locals stating they were all killed as a result of an air attack carried out by planes of the Russian Federation's military,"" Lubinets was translated as saying in Ukrainian.

Ilyenkov said they found bodies with rope around their necks and hands. Anatoli Garagatniy, who was jailed by Russian soldiers for 110 days for filming the invasion, weeped while he told CBS News he thought he'd end up buried here as well. ""They tortured me using electric shocks,"" he said. ""My nerves are shattered."" Some of those imprisoned with him did not get out alive. He believes they will be found in this pine forest on the outskirts of Izyum. It was in Bucha that the world first saw the brutality that Russian troops were capable of.

(CNN) -- Even the heavy rainfall couldn't erase the smell of death in the pine forest in Izium on Friday afternoon, as Ukrainian investigators worked their way through a mass burial site found in the eastern Ukrainian city after its recapture from Russian forces. Ukraine's Defense Ministry said at least 440 ""unmarked"" graves were found in the city in recent days. The country's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that some of the bodies found in Izium showed ""signs of torture,"" blaming Russia for what he called ""cruelty and terrorism."" Izium was subject to intense Russian artillery attacks in April. The city, which sits near the border between the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, became an important hub for the invading military during five months of occupation. Ukrainian forces took back control of the city on Saturday, delivering a strategic blow to Russia's military assault in the east. When CNN arrived to the mass burial site on Friday afternoon, officials were transporting body bags, including one that appeared to be holding something very small, into a refrigerated truck. Most graves at the burial site are individual graves, with wooden crosses placed at the head of the dirt mounds. Some with names and numbers handwritten on them. One had a number as high as 398. Another with the name of an 82-year-old man. One official at the site told CNN that investigations would have to determine when these people died. Further down in the forest lies what appeared to be a former military position, with tank positions dug deep into the ground. A policeman at the scene told CNN that the spot is a mass grave where 17 bodies were found. ""Here are civilian bodies and military ones further along,"" Igor Garmash, an investigator at the scene said of the specific part of the site he was examining, pointing to a location nearby. ""Over 20 bodies have been examined and sent for further investigation,"" he told CNN. Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications said on Thursday that some of the graves discovered at Izium were ""fresh,"" and that the corpses buried there were ""mostly civilians."" Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian Parliament's Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a video statement from the site that ""there is a whole family right next to me... This is a young family... The father was born in 1988, the wife was born in 1991, their little daughter was born in 2016."" He said local people told the investigators that the family had died in a Russian airstrike. ""Also we saw here a mass burial of servicemen of the Ukrainian army. The way they were buried -- you will see evidence that their hands were tied, they were killed at close range,"" Lubinets said. An Izium resident living across the street from the mass burial site told CNN the Russians first hit a nearby city graveyard with an airstrike and then moved in. ""They brought their special machines. They dug some trenches for their vehicles. We only heard how they were destroying the forest,"" Nadezhda Kalinichenko told CNN. She said she tried not to go out during the time the city was under the Russian occupation because she was too scared. ""When they left, I don't know if there was fighting or not. We just heard a lot of heavy trucks one night a week ago,"" she said. Zelensky said during his address on Thursday that Russia must be held accountable for deaths there, and in other cities where large numbers of bodies had been found. ""Bucha, Mariupol and now, unfortunately, Izium... Russia leaves death everywhere. And must be responsible for it. The world must hold Russia to real responsibility for this war. We will do everything for this,"" he added. The Governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said that ""the scale of the crimes committed by the invaders in Izium is enormous. This is bloody brutal terror."" Syniehubov said that ""450 bodies of civilians with traces of violent death and torture were buried in a forest belt. It is difficult to imagine something like this in the 21st century, but now it is a tragic reality in Izium."" Syniehubov said that among the bodies exhumed on Friday ""99 percent showed signs of violent death."" ""There are several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person is buried with a rope around his neck. Obviously, these people were tortured and executed. There are also children among the buried,"" he said. Meanwhile, Oleh Kotenko, Ukraine's commissioner for missing persons, said in a Telegram post that search operations for the remains of ""fallen heroes"" were proceeding cautiously throughout the region. ""The biggest problem is that some areas are still mined. Despite this, we continue to work, because we have to return each hero home so that the families can honor the memory of the soldiers who died for Ukraine in a dignified manner as soon as possible,"" Kotenko said. Zelensky visited Izium on Wednesday and told journalists he was ""shocked"" by the number of ""destroyed buildings"" and ""killed people"" left in the wake of the Russian occupation. A United Nations source has told CNN that a team from the UN's human rights monitoring agency -- the OCHR -- would be going to Izium and areas around it as soon as possible. The War Crimes investigation team may follow after that, the source said. Their specific destination remains unclear at this time. Moscow was using Izium as a launching pad for attacks southward into the Donetsk region and Kupyansk, some 48 kilometers (30 miles) to the north of Izium, and as a rail hub to resupply its forces. Zelensky also thanked foreign governments for sending investigators and prosecutors to investigate alleged human rights abuses by occupying forces in Ukraine, adding that all occupied areas would eventually return. Ukrainian forces have been on a sustained military offensive, particularly in the country's northeast and southern regions. Zelensky said on Tuesday that 8,000 square kilometers (3,088 square miles) of territory had now been liberated by Ukrainian forces so far this month, with roughly half the area still undergoing ""stabilization"" measures.

2022-09-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-putin-zelenskyy-mass-grave-izium/,"Mass grave found in recaptured city in Ukraine, Zelenskyy says","Ukrainian authorities found a mass burial site near a recaptured northeastern city previously occupied by Russian forces, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday night. ""A mass grave of people was found in Izium in the Kharkiv region. The necessary procedures have already begun there. More information — clear, verifiable information — should be available tomorrow,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly televised address. Associated Press journalists saw the site in a forest outside Izium on Thursday. Amid the trees were hundreds of graves with simple wooden crosses, most of them marked only with numbers. A larger grave bore a marker saying it contained the bodies of 17 Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainian investigators were already at work examining the site with metal detectors for any hidden explosives. Oleg Kotenko, an official with the Ukrainian ministry tasked with reintegrating occupied territories, said videos that Russian soldiers posted on social media indicated there were likely more than 17 bodies in the mass grave. ""We haven't counted them yet, but I think there are more than 25 or even 30,"" he said. Izium resident Sergei Gorodko said that among the hundreds buried in individual graves were dozens of adults and children killed in a Russian airstrike on an apartment building. He said he pulled some of them out of the rubble ""with my own hands."" In his address to the nation, Zelenskyy invoked the names of other Ukrainian cities where authorities said retreating Russian troops left behind mass civilian graves and evidence of possible war crimes. ""Bucha, Mariupol, now, unfortunately, Izium. … Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for it. The world must bring Russia to real responsibility for this war,"" he said. Sergei Bolvinov, a senior investigator for Ukrainian police in the eastern Kharkiv region, told British TV broadcaster Sky News that a pit containing more than 440 bodies was discovered near Izium after Kyiv's forces swept in. He described the grave as ""one of the largest burial sites in any one liberated city."" ""We know that some (of the people buried in the pit) were shot, some died from artillery fire, from so called mine-explosion traumas. Some died from airstrikes. Also, we have information that a lot of bodies have not been identified yet"" Bolvinov said. Russia's forces left Izium and other parts of the Kharkiv region last week amid a stunning Ukrainian counteroffensive. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy made a rare trip outside Ukraine's capital to watch the raising of the national flag at Izium's city hall. Ukraine's deputy interior minister, Yevhen Enin, said Thursday night that other evidence found after Kyiv's sweeping advance into the Kharkiv region included multiple ""torture chambers"" where both Ukrainian citizens and foreigners were detained ""in completely inhuman conditions."" ""We have already come across the exhumation of individual bodies, not only with traces of a violent death, but also of torture — cut off ears, etc. This is just the beginning,"" Enin said in an interview with Ukraine's Radio NV. He claimed that among those held at one of the sites were students from an unspecified Asian country who were captured at a Russian checkpoint as they tried to leave for Ukrainian-controlled territory. Enin did not specify where the students were held, although he named the small cities of Balakliya and Volchansk as two locations where the alleged torture chambers were found. His account could not be immediately verified independently. ""All these traces of war crimes are now carefully documented by us. And we know from the experience of Bucha that the worst crimes can only be exposed over time,"" Enin said, in a reference to a Kyiv suburb where the bodies of hundreds of civilians were discovered following the Russian army's withdrawal from the area in March. Earlier Thursday, Zelenskyy said that during the five months the Russians occupied the region, they ""only destroyed, only deprived, only took away. They left behind devastated villages; in some of them there is not a single undamaged house. The occupiers turned schools into garbage dumps, and churches — shattered, literally turned into toilets.""",45,1.7686044866609991,5.917834946834104,-4.149230460173104,8

The cable released Tuesday cites a new intelligence assessment of Russia's global covert efforts to support policies and parties sympathetic to Moscow. The cable does not name specific Russian targets but says the U.S. is providing classified information to select individual countries. It's the latest effort by the Biden administration to declassify intelligence about Moscow's military and political aims, dating back to ultimately correct assessments that Russia would launch a new war against Ukraine. Many of President Joe Biden's top national security officials have extensive experience countering Moscow and served in government when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched wide-ranging campaigns to influence the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections. A senior administration official declined to say how much money Russia is believed to have spent in Ukraine, where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his top deputies have long accused Putin of meddling in domestic politics. The official noted allegations of Russian influence in recent elections in Albania, Bosnia and Montenegro, all Eastern European countries that have faced historical pressure from Moscow. Unlike declared efforts by foreign governments to lobby for preferred initiatives, Russia's covert influence involved using front organizations to funnel money to preferred causes or politicians, the cable alleges. That includes think tanks in Europe and state-owned enterprises in Central America, Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. The U.S. has in its history also covertly funded political groups and been responsible for efforts to topple or undermine foreign governments. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration, rejected comparisons between Russia's activities and current U.S. financing of media and political initiatives. Putin was spending huge sums ""in an attempt to manipulate democracies from the inside,"" the official said. State Department spokesman Ned Price called Russia's covert funding an ""assault on sovereignty."" ""It is an effort to chip away at the ability of people around the world to choose the governments that they see best fit to represent them, to represent their interests, and to represent their values,"" he said. Russia's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The State Department took the unusual step of releasing a diplomatic cable that was sent on Monday to many U.S. embassies and consulates abroad, many of them in Europe, Africa and South Asia, laying out the concerns. The cable, which was marked ""sensitive"" and not intended for foreign audiences but was not classified, contained a series of talking points that U.S. diplomats were instructed to raise with their host governments regarding alleged Russian interference. Among steps diplomats were told to recommend include sanctions, travel bans, and exposure of covert financing. According to the cable, intelligence officials believe Russia planned to transfer ""at least hundreds of millions more"" dollars in funding to sympathetic parties and officials around the world. The cable does not say how intelligence officials came up with the total figure of $300 million. It also does not address concerns that Russia or other adversaries may again try to interfere in U.S. politics. The official briefing reporters noted that Biden had recently extended a national emergency declaration addressing the continued threat of foreign election interference. ""We're promoting coordination with our democratic peers,"" the official said. ""And we'll be exchanging lessons learned, all to advance our collective election security, but also our election security here at home.""",20,6.15503448110019,5.356419166924828,0.798615314175362,29

Northwestern Polytechnical University reported computer break-ins in June, the National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center announced. It said the center, working with a commercial security provider, Qihoo 360 Technology Co., traced the attacks to the National Security Agency but didn't say how that was done. China and the United States are, along with Russia, regarded as global leaders in cyberwarfare research. China accuses the United States of spying on universities, energy and internet companies and other targets. Washington accuses Beijing of stealing commercial secrets and has announced criminal charges against Chinese military officers. The U.S. actions ""seriously endanger China's national security,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. She also accused Washington of eavesdropping on Chinese mobile phones and stealing text messages. ""China strongly condemns it,"" Mao said. ""The United States should immediately stop using its advantages to steal secrets and attack other countries."" The American Embassy in Beijing didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Security experts say the ruling Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, and the Ministry of State Security also sponsor hackers outside the government. Northwestern Polytechnical University, in the western city of Xi'an, is on a U.S. government ""entity list"" that limits its access to American technology. Washington says the university helps the PLA develop aerial and underwater drones and missile technology. Monday's announcement accused the United States of taking information about the university's network management and other ""core technologies."" It said Chinese analysts found 41 ""network attack"" tools that it said were traced to the NSA. Last year, a Chinese man, Shuren Qin, was sentenced to two years in prison by a federal court in Boston after he pleaded guilty to exporting underwater and marine technology to Northwestern Polytechnical University without required licenses. The NSA, part of the Department of Defense, is responsible for ""signals intelligence,"" or obtaining communications and other data. The Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, set up in 1996 by the police department of the eastern city of Tianjin, describes itself as the Chinese agency responsible for inspection and testing of anti-computer virus products. A report by Qihoo 360 in 2020 said hacking tools used in attacks on Chinese companies and government agencies in 2008-19 were traced to the Central Intelligence Agency by comparing them with code in CIA tools disclosed by the Wikileaks group. The virus center accused the NSA of carrying out other ""malicious network attacks"" in China but gave no details. It said 13 people involved in the attacks had been identified. The hackers targeted a ""zero day,"" or previously unreported, vulnerability in the school's security, the statement said. It said the break-ins were conducted from servers in 17 countries including Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Poland, Ukraine and Colombia. The statement described what it said were NSA software tools with names such as ""Second Date"" and ""Drinking Tea"" but didn't say which might have been used at the university.",20,6.17239893874774,6.371897645092486,-0.19949870634474554,12

A helicopter with a rescue team was on the way to the site of the accident, emergency officials said. Russian media initially reported on Saturday that five climbers died while trying to ascend to the top of the Klyuchevskaya Sopka volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka peninsula. The accident occurred about 500 meters below the 4,750-meter (15,884-foot) summit, the reports cited the prosecutor's office of the Kamchatka region as saying. All the climbers were Russians, the reports said. Four people survived the accident and were waiting for the rescuers at different altitudes. One person is thought to have a broken leg, Reuters reported, citing officials. Reuters reported that freezing winds halted an initial rescue attempt on the mountain where temperatures can reach as low as 7 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. Last year, the volcano erupted on its northwestern slope, seeping lava and ejecting volcanic bombs. The Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's far northeast is noted for its array of active and dormant volcanos, hot springs and abundant wildlife. The incident marks the latest in a recent string of climbing accidents involving volcanoes around the world. Last month, three mountaineers died and 12 were injured after they fell while climbing Ecuador's Carihuairazo volcano. In June, a woman died and a climbing companion was injured when they scaled the highly active, off-limits peak of the Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico. In July, an American tourist had to be rescued on Mount Vesuvius near Naples after he apparently slipped into the Italian volcano's crater while trying to recover his fallen cell phone.",47,6.231693712872638,3.4063419552475627,2.8253517576250755,28
2022-09-04,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/himars-ukraines-fight-against-russia/,How HIMARS launchers are shifting momentum in Ukraine's fight against Russia,"It's been a standard, largely-unnoticed part of the American military arsenal for decades. But when HIMARS (an acronym which stands for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) showed up in Ukraine, it changed the face of battle. ""This capability has given the Ukrainians the potential to completely change the momentum and the direction of this war,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe. He said HIMARS, which fires a 200-pound warhead up to 50 miles and hits within 10 feet of its intended target, has virtually eliminated Russia's numerical advantage. ""You don't have to have hundreds of artillery rounds to achieve the same effect as one rocket fired from HIMARS,"" said Hodges. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin asked, ""Is Ukraine still outgunned?"" ""In numbers, I'd say yes. But what really matters is effect. And the effect that Ukraine is achieving, it seems to me at this point to be superior to what the Russians are able to deliver."" Since June, the U.S. has shipped Ukraine 16 HIMARS launchers and thousands of rockets, which defense officials say the Ukrainians have used to attack more than 350 Russian command posts, ammo dumps, supply depots, and other high-value targets far back from the front lines. Hodges said, ""The HIMARS and other long-range capabilities have given the Ukrainians the ability to reach out and hit targets that the Russians would have thought were safe."" Martin asked, ""Why can't they just move all these command posts and ammo dumps further back from the front line and get them out of range?"" ""You still gotta get that ammunition to the guns, which are closer to the front,"" Hodges replied. ""So, now you've increased the distance that the trucks have to move, carrying very heavy ammunition. And they've lost well over 1,000 trucks in this campaign so far. The result is significant reduction in the amount of Russian artillery and rocket fire impacting on Ukrainian forces."" All that from a weapon made at a Lockheed Martin plant in rural Arkansas – a seemingly minor outpost in America's vast military-industrial complex, which is now racing to catch up with the sudden demand for HIMARS. ""Sunday Morning"" accompanied the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, Dr. William LaPlante, as he made plans to dramatically increase production. ""We have to plan for at least to double this – the production here probably will be double,"" LaPlante said. Martin asked, ""How long can you keep that up?"" ""As long as the demand is needed. We can keep production lines open for 30 years."" Lockheed Martin's chief operating officer Frank St. John said the plant is currently turning out about 7,500 rockets a year. Martin asked him, ""You heard the man from the Pentagon; he said they're probably going to double production. Can you double production?"" ""Absolutely,"" said St. John. ""We have capacity to produce 10,000 rockets a year. That's a rocket every 10 minutes if you do the math on that. We're also doing similar analysis to take that up to 12,000 or 14,000 rockets a year."" ""How fast can you do this?"" ""I would say on the order of 18 to 24 months, to make any significant changes in the production quantities."" The nose cone carries a satellite guidance system which gives the rocket its sniper-like accuracy. But what impresses LaPlante most about HIMARS is not the sophistication of its technology, but the simplicity of its use. ""There are just three operators, probably 18- to-20-years-old, and the system works,"" he said. ""And they can use it effectively within a week. That to me is as important as its accuracy. It's reliable, and can be done by 18-year-old Ukrainians."" To see how HIMARS operates in the field, Martin went to the U.S. Army training range in Yakima, Washington, where they use the same tactics taught to the Ukrainians. At a ""hide site,"" the HIMARS crew tries to conceal itself from enemy surveillance. Once it leaves here for its firing position, the HIMARS is liable to be spotted and targeted, so the clock starts ticking. The HIMARS launcher has a top speed of 55 miles an hour, but off-road in the high desert it's more like 35. Once it's out in the open, it has about five-to-seven minutes to find its firing position, train its rockets on the target, and fire – one rocket every few seconds. Martin asked the crew chief of one HIMARS, Staff Sergeant Cami White, ""How'd you guys do?"" ""We did well!"" she replied. ""What does that mean, 'well'?"" ""Whenever we get a 'fire when ready,' it's as fast as you can fire it. So with that, I think our time was around three minutes."" ""Three minutes from the time you got the mission, to the time the rockets took off?"" ""Yes, sir."" When the HIMARS fires, the rocket exhaust gives away its position, so it has to get out of there fast before the enemy can strike back. ""How long do you have to get out?"" Martin asked. ""Oh, as quickly as possible,"" said White. ""Roughly a minute."" It's called ""shoot and scoot,"" and the Ukrainians are doing it now in their counteroffensive against Russian forces occupying Kherson, making the most of the 16 HIMARS provided by the U.S. ""Sixteen just doesn't sound like a lot,"" Martin said. ""It's nowhere near what I think Ukraine could use,"" Hodges said. ""I mean, look at the effect they've achieved with 16. Imagine if they had three or four times that many.""

""Then one man came in with a rifle and threatened to cut off my ear to play with it,"" said the man, identified only as Anatolii V. to protect his identity, about his experience in a so-called filtration camp in Russian-held territory in Ukraine. Anatolii V., who is now in Germany, was among dozens of Ukrainians whose horrifying accounts are laid out in detail in the HRW report on the Russian camps. The report comes amid mounting allegations from U.S. and Ukrainian officials about the filtration camps, where Ukrainians are allegedly forced to undergo invasive security checks and interrogations as they flee Russian-held areas. Russian authorities have forcibly brought some of the Ukrainians into Russia, or simply made them disappear, according to the report. ""During the process, [separatist Donetsk People's Republic] or Russian officials collected civilians' biometric data, including fingerprints and photographs of their face looking forward and in profile; searched their bodies, belongings and phones; and questioned them about their political views and ties to Ukrainian armed forces and government agencies,"" the Human Rights Watch report says. ""While for some the wait lasted only hours, many had to remain near the filtration centers for between three days and up to almost a month, waiting to undergo interrogation."" HRW's report quotes family members as saying ""those who 'failed' the filtration process in the [Donetsk People's Republic], apparently due to their suspected ties to the Ukrainian military or national groups, were detained and some forcibly disappeared."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in July that an estimated 900,000 to 1.6 million Ukrainians, including 260,000 children, had been ""interrogated, detained and forcibly deported"" to Russia, adding that the forced deportations are a war crime. A U.S. intelligence assessment from June said filtration operations had been identified in ""18 possible locations in eastern Ukraine and western Russia,"" with more likely yet to be detected. Last week, a State Department-funded program released a report that documented 21 sites allegedly linked to filtration operations in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region alone, much of which has been controlled by Russian forces or their separatist allies for months. ""This adds to the growing body of credible reporting and evidence on filtration operations that should deeply concern us all,"" the State Department said. Russia has denied the allegations, claiming that it's providing humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians from occupied areas. Anatolii V. told HRW that Russian forces had also detained his stepson during house-to-house searches. He said his stepson was released after three weeks in custody, with six broken ribs and a broken jaw. When a Ukrainian volunteer tried to rescue 17 children from a Mariupol health care facility, Russian-backed forces put the children on a bus and drove them to the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, which is controlled by Russian backed separatist, HRW said. The whereabouts of 11 of the children were still unknown, according to the report. Two teenage brothers feeling Mariupol were forcibly separated from their mother, who previously served in Ukraine's armed forces, the report says. After authorities promised they would be reunited with their mother, they were eventually retrieved by their father who lives in Russia, according the the report. Russian authorities told the man that the younger son would be placed in an orphanage. The mother's fate is unknown, HRW said. Ukrainians told the New York-based international rights group that the conditions in the filtration camps where they were held were squalid, with little food and sickness spreading. ""The evidence of Russian forces interrogating, detaining, and forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, including children, continues to mount,"" U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said last week.

""This is another confirmation of the excellent cooperation between the United States of America and Montenegro and a proof that we can count on their support in any situation,"" the ministry said of the deployment of the Cyber Action Team. Last weekend, Montenegro's Agency for National Security said the country was ""under a hybrid war at the moment,"" blaming the attack squarely on Russia, though without providing evidence. A cybercriminal extortion gang has claimed responsibility for at least part of the attack, infecting a parliamentary office with a variant of ransomware known as Cuba. Russian-speaking cybercriminals generally operate without Kremlin interference, as long as they don't target friendly nations. Montenegrin officials said Russia has a strong motive for such an attack because the Balkan state, once considered a strong Russian ally, joined NATO in 2017 despite strong opposition from the Kremlin. It has also joined Western sanctions against Moscow because of its invasion of Ukraine. Other Eastern European states deemed enemies of Russia have recently also sustained cyberattacks, mostly nuisance-level denial of service campaigns, in recent weeks. Targets have included networks in Moldova, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Albania. But the attack against Montenegro's infrastructure seemed more sustained and extensive, with targets including water supply systems, transportation services and online government services, among many others. On Monday, government officials said that an attack by hackers on the information system of Montenegrin institutions was still ongoing, but that the system will not suffer permanent damage. ""A huge amount of money was invested in the attack on our system"", said Minister of Public Administration Maras Dukaj He added that his ministry cannot determine the source of the attack, but that there is ""strong indication that it is coming from Russia."" The Director of the Directorate for Information Security, Dusan Polovic, said that ""150 cells"" in a dozen state institutions were infected, and that the data of the Ministry of Public Administration was not permanently damaged. ""The infected stations have been removed from the network and hard drives have been removed from them for further forensics,"" he said, adding that ""the priority is to put the tax system into operation, but this will be done only when it is completely secure.""",20,7.0464179643084535,5.964919010446952,1.0814989538615016,6
2022-08-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-aid-3-billion-biden-administration-announcement/,Biden announces $3 billion in additional aid to Ukraine,"Washington — President Biden announced Wednesday that the U.S. is sending its largest security package to Ukraine to date, valued at $3 billion. The announcement coincided with the six-month anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The package will come from the Ukraine Security Assistance (USAI) funds process, which means the U.S. will buy the weapons through contracts instead of drawing from existing Defense Department inventory and sending them immediately. ""The United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty. As part of that commitment, I am proud to announce our biggest tranche of security assistance to date: approximately $2.98 billion of weapons and equipment to be provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,"" Mr. Biden said in a statement. ""This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term."" The administration has used the USAI process in previous security packages for items like medium-range air defense systems, surveillance drones and counter-artillery radar systems. The time it takes for the weapons to get to Ukraine depends on industry's production lines. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned against public Independence Day celebrations due to fears that Russia could conduct ""particularly ugly"" attacks. The State Department issued an alert Monday that Russia might step up its efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The occasion comes as the war grinds on in southern and eastern Ukraine. A senior defense official told reporters last week that Russia is seeing ""a complete and total lack of progress."" The official noted the Ukrainians are successfully striking Russian capabilities which could have a long term effect, but they haven't retaken significant territory from Russia.",49,6.565197011418272,2.751146117345029,3.814050894073243,27
2022-08-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ukraine-independence-day-attack-reported-six-months-after-start-of-war/,"22 killed in Independence Day attack in Ukraine, Zelenskyy says","President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces launched a rocket attack on a Ukrainian train station on Wednesday, the embattled country's Independence Day, killing 22 people. Zelenskyy had warned for days that Moscow might attempt ""something particularly cruel"" this week. The lethal attack took place in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 people in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukrainian news agencies quoted Zelenskyy as telling the U.N. Security Council via video. The president's office also reported that an 11-year-old child was killed by rocket fire earlier in the day in the settlement. ""Chaplyne is our pain today,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. At one point, Zelenskyy put the number of wounded at about 50. The deputy head of Zelenskyy's office later said 22 people were wounded in the attack, which hit five passenger rail cars. Ukraine had been bracing for especially heavy attacks around the national holiday that commemorates Ukraine's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Wednesday also marked the six-month point in the war. Days ahead of Independence Day, Kyiv authorities banned large gatherings in the capital through Thursday for fear of missile strikes. Residents of Kyiv, which has been largely spared in recent months, woke up Wednesday to air raid sirens, but no immediate strikes followed. As the day wore on, Russian bombardments were reported in the country's east, west and center, with the most serious attack apparently at the train station. Outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson marked the holiday with a visit to Kyiv — his third since the war broke out — and other European leaders used the occasion to pledge unwavering support for Ukraine, locked in a battle that was widely expected to be a lightning conquest by Moscow but has turned into a grinding war of attrition. U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new military aid package of nearly $3 billion to help Ukrainian forces fight for years to come. Over the weekend, Zelenskyy cautioned that Russia ""may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel"" this week. He repeated the warnings ahead of the train station attack, saying, ""Russian provocations and brutal strikes are a possibility."" Nevertheless, a festive atmosphere prevailed during the day at Kyiv's Maidan square as thousands of residents posed for pictures next to burned-out Russian tanks put on display. Folk singers set up, and many revelers — ignoring the sirens — were out and about in traditionally embroidered dresses and shirts. Others were fearful. ""I can't sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,"" said a retiree who gave only her first name, Tetyana, her voice shaking with emotion. ""This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people."" In a holiday message to the country, Zelenskyy exulted over Ukraine's success in fending off Moscow's forces since the invasion, saying: ""On Feb. 24, we were told: You have no chance. On Aug. 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!"" Britain's Johnson urged Western allies to stand by Ukraine through the winter. ""This is not the time to put forward flimsy negotiating proposals,"" he said. ""You can't negotiate with a bear when it's eating your leg or with a street robber when he has you pinned to the floor."" A car bombing outside Moscow that killed the 29-year-old daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin on Saturday also heightened fears that Russia might intensify attacks on Ukraine this week. Russian officials have blamed Ukraine for the death of Darya Dugina, a pro-Kremlin TV commentator. Ukraine has denied any involvement. Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces have encountered unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in their invasion and abandoned their effort to storm the capital in the spring. The fighting has turned into a slog that has reduced neighborhoods to rubble and sent shock waves through the world economy. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of his counterparts from a security organization dominated by Russia and China, claimed the slow pace of Moscow's military action was due to what he said was an effort to spare civilians. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted civilian areas in cities, including hospitals and a Mariupol theater where hundreds of people were taking shelter. But Shoigu said Russia is carrying out strikes with precision weapons against Ukrainian military targets, and ""everything is done to avoid civilian casualties."" ""Undoubtedly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we do it deliberately,"" he said. On the battlefield, Russian forces struck several towns and villages in Donetsk province in the east over 24 hours, killing one person, authorities said. A building materials superstore in the city of Donetsk was hit by a shell and erupted in flames, the mayor said. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Russians again shelled the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, damaging several buildings and wounding people, authorities said. Russian troops also shelled the city of Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported. In addition, Russian rockets struck unspecified targets in the Khmelnytskyi region, about 180 miles west of Kyiv, the regional governor said. Attacks there have been infrequent.",47,4.417649223982589,3.2856868628019105,1.1319623611806784,19
2022-08-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-aid-ukraine-scan-eagle-surveillance-drones-mine-resistant-vehicles/,Newest U.S. aid package to Ukraine to include surveillance drones,"The U.S. for the first time Friday said it will give Ukraine Scan Eagle surveillance drones, mine-resistant vehicles, anti-armor rounds and howitzer weapons to help Ukrainian forces regain territory and mount a counteroffensive against Russian invaders. A senior defense official told reporters that a new $775 million aid package will include 15 Scan Eagles, 40 mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles known as MRAPs with mine-clearing rollers, and 2,000 anti-armor rounds that can help Ukraine troops move forward in the south and east, where Russian forces have placed mines. The official said the U.S. is looking to help shape and arm the Ukrainian force of the future as the war drags on. ""These capabilities are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield and strengthen Ukraine's position at the negotiating table,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. This latest aid comes as Russia's war on Ukraine is about to reach the six-month mark. It brings the total U.S. military aid to Ukraine to about $10.6 billion since the beginning of the Biden administration. It is the 19th time the Pentagon has provided equipment from Defense Department stocks to Ukraine since August 2021. The U.S. has provided howitzer ammunition in the past, but this is the first time it will send 16 of the weapon systems. The aid package also includes 1,500 anti-tank missiles, 1,000 javelin missiles and an undisclosed number of high-speed, anti-radiation or HARM missiles that target radar systems. The Ukrainian forces have been successfully using various precision artillery systems to try and hold off Russian forces and take back territory Moscow has gained. The defense official briefed reporters on the new weapons aid on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Defense Department. For much of the last four months of the war, Russia has concentrated on capturing the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists have controlled some territory as self-proclaimed republics for eight years. Russian forces have made some incremental gains in the east, but they have also been put on the defensive in other regions, as Ukraine ratchets up its attacks in Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. The Russian-occupied territory was seized by Moscow in 2014. Nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed last week at an airbase on Crimea in strikes that highlighted the Ukrainians' capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines. Russian leaders have warned that striking facilities in Crimea marks an escalation in the conflict fueled by the U.S. and NATO allies and threatens to pull America deeper into the war. One Western official said Friday that the war is at a ""near operational standstill,"" with neither side able to launch major offensives. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said the whole tempo of the campaign has slowed, partly because both sides recognize that ""this is a marathon not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important."" But the U.S. and Western officials both said that Ukraine has been able to launch successful attacks deep behind Russian battle lines, which is eroding logistics support and command and control of Moscow's forces, and harming their morale. The U.S. official said that while Ukrainian troops haven't been able to retake a lot of territory, they have been able to significantly weaken Russian positions in a number of places. Efforts to tamp down the fighting have also continued. On Thursday, Turkey's leader and the U.N. chief met in western Ukraine with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. They discussed a range of issues including prisoner exchanges and an effort to get U.N. atomic energy experts to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The facility has been controlled by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began on Feb. 24 and has been the target of a number of explosions. Kyiv and Moscow accuse each other of shelling the plant, stoking international fears of a catastrophe on the continent. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would follow up with Russian President Vladimir Putin, given that most of the matters discussed would require the Kremlin's agreement. Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.",49,1.765884005025687,3.6854958294288704,-1.9196118244031835,19
2022-08-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-crimes-calls-for-nuremberg-style-tribunal-crime-of-aggression/,Could Russia's Vladimir Putin face a Nuremberg-style tribunal over the Ukraine war?,"London — As prosecutors gather evidence of thousands of war crimes allegedly committed by Russian troops in Ukraine, a number of prominent figures have joined the Ukrainian government to call for a new Nuremberg-style tribunal to hold Russia's leaders to account for one specific crime they say is falling through the cracks: the crime of aggression. Ukraine is working with various international bodies to prosecute war crimes, and it's already charging people within its own criminal justice system. But prosecution for the crime of aggression, advocates for a special tribunal say, may be the best way to see Russian President Vladimir Putin himself face justice for the war. ""When bombs fall on your cities, when soldiers rape women in the occupied cities… it's difficult, of course, to speak about the efficiency of international law,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba said when the call for a tribunal was first announced in March. ""But this is the only tool of civilization that is available to us to make sure that, in the end, eventually, all those who made this war possible will be brought to justice."" Since 1945, there have been four types of defined international crime: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression. The last, articulated under the International Criminal Court's founding Rome Statute, is defined as ""waging a manifestly illegal war,"" professor and international law expert Philippe Sands told CBS News. Aggression ""is a leadership crime,"" Sands explained. ""It is only committed by those who have the power, the capacity to decide to wage or continue a manifestly illegal war. What that means in the context of Ukraine; you're talking about Mr. Putin, Mr. Lavrov [Russian Foreign Minister], the Minister of Defense, the top military officials, the top intelligence people."" But prosecuting Russia for the crime of aggression over the war in Ukraine is no straightforward task under the current international justice system. In the specific case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine — barring an extremely unlikely referral from the United Nations Security Council, where Russia has veto power — the International Criminal Court does not have jurisdiction over aggression. ""There is a gap in the international legal order,"" Sands said. ""The crime exists in international law, but there's no way to enforce it."" With the other war crimes or crimes against humanity allegedly committed by Russian troops in Ukraine, it may be difficult or even impossible to establish a direct connection to Russia's leaders. ""I think it's possible that you can find evidence that links Putin directly to war crimes, crimes against humanity, but there's absolutely no doubt that Putin is guilty of this initial crime — what the Nuremberg trial authors called the 'initial and fundamental and supreme crime' — the crime of actually planning an aggression against a sovereign state,"" former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who's backing the establishment of a tribunal for Ukraine, told CBS News. ""The only thing [Putin] will understand is if there is a strong response from the West, and part of the strong response is to tell him that he cannot escape with impunity for crimes that he himself has committed and is responsible for directing,"" Brown said. Mykola Gnatovsky, a law professor and advisor to Ukraine's foreign minister, agrees that a strong international response to Russia's actions is necessary to show that invading a sovereign state without justification is unacceptable. ""We are dealing with current dramatic, tragic situation, to a significant degree, because in 2014, when Russia attacked Ukraine and seized parts of its territory, the international community has not been able to provide a strong response which would be strong enough to deter any further action by the aggressor, to hold the aggressor to account,"" Gnatovsky said when the initiative to create a tribunal was announced in March. Some major geopolitical powerhouses, including the United States, have yet to explicitly back the call for a special international tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression. ""They're worried that if you create a special tribunal for one permanent member of the Security Council today, then tomorrow another could be created in relation to some allegation of a British crime or a French crime or an American crime,"" Sands told CBS News. ""There is an elephant in the room here, and that, of course, is Iraq."" Brown, who was Britain's leader at the end of the U.K. involvement in the Iraq war, said any special tribunal would not be retrospective. ""The crime of aggression is one that has only been added to the International Criminal Court's statutes in the last few years,"" Brown said. ""So we're talking not retrospectively, we're talking about action taken on the basis of decisions that have been made by the international community very recently."" ""The United States has been a leader, historically, on the international stage with respect to accountability for the most serious crimes and, of course, the United States was one of the countries that formed the Nuremberg Tribunal after the Second World War,"" James Goldston, the executive director of the Open Society Justice Initiative, told CBS News. ""That being said, it is no surprise that major powers including the United States may look with some trepidation at prosecutions for the crime of aggression, given their own historical activities, and given their own desire to preserve freedom of action going forward."" The Open Society Justice Initiative has published a model indictment that could be used to try Russia's leaders for the crime of aggression. ""If Putin is not prosecuted for aggression, I want the historical record to reflect that the legal case against him was clear, and that the failure was purely political,"" said Rebecca Hamilton, an associate professor of law at American University in Washington D.C., who co-authored an early version of a model indictment. ""What Putin has done and is continuing to do against the Ukrainian people is criminal,"" said Hamilton. ""It is as criminal today as it was when he launched this war back in February. And while the rest of the world is start[ing] to get distracted by other issues, the Ukrainian people do not have the luxury of 'moving on.'""",45,6.36621480868597,7.029173859192381,-0.6629590505064114,8

Announcing the drawdown from the U.S. military's stocks, Secretary of State Antony Blinken praised the Ukrainians for already using such weapons ""so effectively to defend themselves"" amid Russia's assault. But as CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports from the key port city of Mykolaiv, Ukraine's defenders say they need more, and fast. The message from the Ukrainian general tasked with keeping the city out of Russian hands as it braces for an expected showdown was unambiguous: If they stand any chance of fighting back, they need more firepower. Major General Dmytro Marchenko spoke to D'Agata in the rubble of the regional government headquarters. He and his troops are hoping to stage a counter offensive, but none of them need reminding that Russia has the upper hand when it comes to heavy weapons. Marchenko told CBS News that for every 100 shells the Russians fire at the city, his forces can respond with only 10. But the Kremlin's forces are running out of precision-guided missiles they used to raze buildings in Mykolaiv in the spring, during the early days of the war. The general listed the weapons the city's people and infrastructure are now facing, from long-range missiles to Soviet-made rockets from the 1960's — even anti-aircraft munitions and cluster bombs. Marchenko credited American-supplied, advanced HIMARS multiple-launch rocket systems for helping his forces strike weapons depots and sever supply lines far behind the Russian front lines. More HIMARS rockets were among the items promised by Washington on Monday. The general called the HIMARS ""one of the main factors"" behind his troops' ability to hold their ground so far, and to start seeking an advantage on the battlefield. But the Russian onslaught has been relentless. The front-line town of Bakhmut, hundreds of miles east of Mykolaiv, has suffered ferocious bombardment. The incessant shelling of the eastern Donbas region's main water supply has left residents in the city of Sloviansk without water for two months, adding to the suffering in cities under siege. Mykolaiv is also bombed every night. It was hit again Monday night and early Tuesday morning, and D'Agata and his team could hear the explosions in the distance. General Marchenko said it happens three times a day, and the bombs strike at random, hitting civilians homes, and even hospitals.",49,5.228199199780777,3.609635244055374,1.6185639557254028,11

The shipment of weapons and equipment will include more ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 1,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-armor systems, mortar systems and tens of thousands of artillery ammunition, as well as 50 armored medical treatment vehicles and medical supplies, the Pentagon said. The latest delivery of arms from the Defense Department brings the total amount of U.S. security aid to Ukraine to $9.8 billion since President Biden took office last year, including more than $9 billion since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.

2022-08-04,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-takes-down-russian-troll-farm/,Meta takes down Russian troll farm,"Meta says that it's continuing to crack down on bad actors across its social media sites. The company, which owns Facebook and Instagram, reported Thursday that it had taken down a Russia-based troll farm from Instagram earlier this year that had been churning out phony posts about the war in Ukraine. Global threat intelligence lead Ben Nimmo said the troll farm, referred to as ""Cyber Front Z,"" based in St. Petersburg, was detected by Meta in mid-March and taken down by early April. Meta's Quarterly Adversarial Threat Report, released Thursday, also noted the group was linked to people who had been associated with the Internet Research Agency, one of the major entities involved in Russia's sprawling efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Since it was taken down, the troll farm has tried to come back, the report says, but Meta continues to detect those efforts and disable them. Nimmo said Cyber Front Z hired dozens of people off the street to make what appeared to look like authentic posts defending Russia and criticizing Ukraine. ""They ran a Telegram channel that told people basically to leave pro-Russian comments on social media posts by public figures, journalists, politicians, celebrities, like Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman."" Nimmo, who spoke on a press call Thursday, said the troll farm targeted users on LinkedIn, Twitter and ""many different platforms."" In its report, Meta said the troll farm operated 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts. It also reported that about 49,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts. Beyond Russia, the report also detailed actions Meta took against hacking group APT 36, which operates out of Pakistan. The group targeted social media users in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia using various malicious tactics to infect devices with malware. ""One of the interesting details we observe here is use of social cards, which are online marketing tools that allow people to customize the image to play when a particular URL is shared on social media. This is another attempt here to essentially trick users into trusting the link to them by sharing a custom image,"" said Mike Dvilyansky, Meta's head of cyber espionage investigations. Meta also said it had taken action against a cyber espionage operation in South Asia known as Bitter APT. These hackers targeted users in New Zealand, India, Pakistan and the United Kingdom with malware. Bitter APT's tactics included posing as attractive women, journalists, or activists to build trust with people and get them to click on malicious links or download malware. Meta's report characterized Bitter APT attacks as ""relatively low in sophistication and operational security"" but nonetheless ""persistent and well-resourced."" The head of Meta security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, expressed the hope that by sharing these threats, Meta users will better be able defend against these attacks. ""More bad actors will engage in cyber espionage and barrier to entry. Because these tools are commoditized, there are many different off-the-shelf malware systems that someone can leverage. It means that sophisticated threat actors can hide in the noise, making it harder at times to tell who's doing what and why.""",20,4.4318624440285515,4.938081637177203,-0.5062191931486515,5

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have a duty to react after shelling of a prison complex in Donetsk province killed the POWs. ""It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address late Friday. ""There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism."" Both sides alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and to destroy evidence, including of possible atrocities. Russia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic. Separatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has organized civilian evacuations in the war and worked to monitor the treatment of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine, said it has requested access to the prison ""to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack."" ""Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive life-saving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,"" the Red Cross said in a statement. Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school building in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred about an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states. In southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a significant port city, the region's administration said Saturday on Facebook. Friday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, another port city where troops famously held out against a monthslong Russian siege. Moscow opened a probe into the attack, sending a team to the site from Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's main criminal investigation agency. The state RIA Novosti agency reported that fragments of U.S.-supplied precision High Mobility Artillery Rocket System rockets were found at the site. The Ukrainian military denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka, and it accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there. The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning responsibility for the attack but that the ""available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.""",47,5.038377548980888,6.239857225875205,-1.2014796768943174,19
2022-07-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guard-troops-training-ukraine-russia-conflict-lessons/,National Guard troops train to avoid pitfalls faced by forces in Ukraine conflict,"One of the most striking images from the early weeks of Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the motionless, miles-long column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. Faced with stronger resistance than they had anticipated, troops were stranded for days as their food and fuel ran low. That stark example inspired U.S. Army readiness experts as they put together this summer's National Guard training exercises. Mid-July weather in Louisiana — where the two-week training is taking place — is nothing like winter in Ukraine, but the commanders are applying the same principles. One trainee scenario, which has been used in past exercises but gains some resonance from the supply shortages seen in Ukraine, forces troops to figure out how to continuously get water to soldiers in the sweltering heat and thick humidity. Brig. Gen. David Gardner, the commanding general of the Army's Joint Readiness Training Center and Fort Polk, told CBS News the challenge of distributing something as low tech as water can be unforgiving, with many variables at play. A soldier can only carry about a gallon at a time and may consume two to three gallons a day in the heat, which means the unit has to solve the problem of ensuring soldiers have enough water to drink, even though they can't each carry all that they'll need. The soldiers must figure out how much transportation is available to move the water and how to protect the delivery routes from enemy interference. Gardner said the same principles apply to other critical resources, like fuel and ammunition. However, the soldiers in the training are kept hydrated and safe throughout the exercise, Gardner added. The exercise is one of about two exercises the Guard does each year at U.S. Army training centers big enough to accommodate the training of a brigade — roughly 5,000 troops. Gen. Dan Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau visited the training center and Fort Polk this week to meet with the commanders leading the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the California National Guard through the training with realistic combat scenarios. ""It's the most difficult training that they will ever do,"" Hokanson said in an interview, ""In fact, what they say is at the training centers, you learn the hardest lessons you'll ever learn and not during actual combat."" While on a tour Tuesday, Hokanson met with different units at the training area, which takes place across more than 150,000 acres. Since the training simulates real scenarios, the soldiers he met with were dressed in full uniform, despite the heat and humidity. The last stop on his vehicle tour brought him down dirt roads in the sprawling forest area to observe a short-range air defense unit. This, too, represents an initiative with elements of the Ukraine conflict. Training for U.S. wars in the early 2000s did not require these systems because the U.S. military largely dominated the air. ""When we were training for Iraq and Afghanistan, we didn't even have air defense units with us because there was no threat, but what we've learned from in the early Russian invasion of the Crimea region and the Donbas, and what we're seeing now is how important it is to have air defense systems on the battlefield to protect us against helicopters, jets, and drones,"" Hokanson said. To make battlefield training scenarios as realistic as possible, the National Guard has added other features, too — obstacles that appeared in the early months of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, like drone attacks and disinformation campaigns. The training center has included a 4G network in the exercise so the soldiers have to sift through potential misinformation and counteract it with information useful to the public. ""It's important when you're in an environment that you're providing that balance and truth to the population so they can see something that may be counter to what they may be seeing from the Russians or the Chinese,"" Hokanson said. The exercise in Louisiana consists of two weeks of ""training days,"" but commanders consider the weeks before and after the exercise when soldiers are moving equipment and personnel to Fort Polk as a part of the training. For this event, the California National Guard moved over 1,000 pieces of equipment by rail to Louisiana, the largest rail move in California Guard history. The two-week training ends Friday with a live fire exercise using real bullets and artillery.",7,6.2918160311702565,4.888441825745822,1.4033742054244343,22
2022-07-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reality-winner-espionage-act-60-minutes-2022-07-24/,Reality Winner and the debate over the Espionage Act - 60 Minutes,"When a National Security Agency whistleblower leaked a document related to Russia's cyber spying, she says she never expected that she would be charged with espionage herself. Now Reality Winner's high-profile case has resurrected a debate over prosecution of national security leakers. In 2017, Winner mailed a top-secret document to an online news outlet intending to set the record straight about which foreign entity had interfered in the 2016 presidential election. After he took office, President Donald Trump had continued to equivocate when speaking about Russian interference, including the attack on the Democratic National Committee. But there had been another hack that targeted the state and local officials who managed voter registration systems. The NSA — and by extension, the White House — had evidence the attack had been carried out by Russian military intelligence. Winner, then an intelligence contractor at the NSA, saw the classified report on an in-house newsfeed in early May 2017. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Winner told correspondent Scott Pelley she was aware of what she was doing when she anonymously mailed the report to The Intercept. ""I knew it was secret,"" she said. ""But I also knew that I had pledged service to the American people. And at that point in time, it felt like they were being led astray."" Winner was arrested two days before The Intercept published the document in June 2017, and within hours of publication, the Justice Department announced she had been charged under the Espionage Act. After more than a year in pre-trial detention, Winner pleaded guilty to the espionage charge. She was sentenced to 63 months in prison — the longest sentence ever imposed against a civilian for leaking information to the media. In total, she spent four years behind bars and five more months on home release. She now faces three years of supervised release, including a curfew and restrictions on her travel. Winner's conviction has added to a century-long controversy over the Espionage Act and its relationship to free speech. Passed two months after the United States entered World War I in 1917, the Espionage Act made it a crime to communicate information that would interfere with American war efforts or help the country's enemies. But the Espionage Act went beyond spying and into territory that put it in contention with First Amendment free speech protections. When it was passed in 1917, the Espionage Act limited public dissent against the war and banned any action that interfered with the military draft effort. An amendment to the law, known as the Sedition Act of 1918, briefly barred criticism of the war effort before it was repealed. As a result of that amendment, former Socialist Party presidential candidate Eugene Debs was arrested and charged with violating the Espionage Act for a speech he gave, in which the government accused him of ""uttering disloyal language about the form of government of the United States."" A year later, in the landmark case Schenck v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that limits on free speech under the Espionage Act were constitutional. Charles Schenck, an anti-war Socialist, had been convicted of violating the law for sending pamphlets encouraging resistance to the draft. The high court, through an opinion written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., concluded that the First Amendment did not protect a defendant if their speech is intended to result in a crime and there is a ""clear and present danger"" that a crime will occur. Schenck, therefore, could be convicted of an attempt to obstruct the draft. In the century since its passing, the Espionage Act has been repeatedly revised and more often used to prosecute those whose actions more closely align with the type of activity the law's name suggests. Those who have been prosecuted under the law include former CIA officer Aldrich Ames, who was convicted of spying for the Soviets, and FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who was convicted of spying for Soviet and Russian intelligence services for 25 years. In 2010, Scott Pelley reported for 60 Minutes on Gregg Bergersen, a civilian analyst at the Pentagon who was caught on tape giving American military secrets to a Chinese spy. Bergersen was prosecuted under the Espionage Act and sentenced to 57 months in prison — six months shorter than the sentence Reality Winner would later receive for leaking to the media. Over time, the enforcement scope of the Espionage Act expanded. Today, those prosecuted under the parameters of the law are often not those who have passed confidential governmental information to foreign governments — but have instead leaked it to the media. In 1973, Daniel Ellsberg became the first civilian whistleblower the government charged with violating the Espionage Act. He had given a classified government study of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, known as the Pentagon Papers, to the New York Times and the Washington Post. After it came to light that the Nixon Administration had illegally gathered evidence against Ellsberg, including a break-in at his psychiatrist's office, the government was forced to drop its case against him. More recently, former Army soldier Chelsea Manning was prosecuted in military court for passing classified military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison before President Obama commuted her sentence in 2017. At the time, she had served nearly seven years behind bars. Other whistleblowers the government has charged with violating the Espionage Act include WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Both have been indicted but, because neither is in the United States, they have not faced trial. Assange is currently being held in a maximum-security prison in London, while Snowden lives in Russia, where he has been granted permanent residency. Free speech advocates have argued against the increasing number of charges brought against those who leak national security documents to the media. When it comes to classified documents, they argue, leakers are given none of the protections afforded to whistleblowers in other industries. ""Unless one believes that the national security establishment has a magical exemption from the dynamics that lead all other large-scale organizations to error, then whistleblowing must be available as a critical arrow in the quiver of any democracy that seeks to contain the tragic consequences that follow when national security organizations make significant errors or engage in illegality or systemic abuse,"" legal scholar Yochai Benkler wrote in the Harvard Law & Policy Review in 2014. ""Aggressive prosecution of national security whistleblowers and accountability leaks threatens to undermine the checking function that whistleblowing provides."" But Richard Moberly, the dean of University of Nebraska College of Law and a legal scholar who researches national security whistleblowers, argues that those seeking to disclose corruption or wrongdoing must stay within the bounds of the democratic process, particularly when that information is top-secret. In a 2013 New York Times opinion article about Edward Snowden, Moberly argued that the former NSA contractor should be prosecuted for choosing the ""irresponsible route"" in leaking the highly classified information that revealed global surveillance programs. ""Snowden ignored ways he could have objected to the program without publicly disclosing it, such as through an inspector general or to a sympathetic member of Congress,"" Moberly argued. ""Whistleblowers should disclose inside information about illegalities and abuse of power, but they should do it responsibly, especially when dealing with national security."" Whistleblower Thomas Drake, a former NSA senior executive, tried to go by the book when he attempted to sound the alarm about a failed project at the agency that was costing American taxpayers more than $1 billion. Drake first complained to his superiors. He then privately informed the intelligence committees on Capitol Hill. After four years of reporting through proper channels, Drake anonymously contacted a Baltimore Sun reporter and became an unnamed source for her articles about mismanagement at the NSA. In 2007, the FBI raided Drake's home and, three years later, a grand jury indicted him under the Espionage Act. Scott Pelley in 2011 interviewed Drake for 60 Minutes. Drake told Pelley his indictment was meant to send a ""chilling"" message to anyone else who may leak government documents. That message, Drake told Pelley, was simple: ""Do not tell truth to power. We'll hammer you."" After the 60 Minutes report aired, the government dropped the charges against Drake in exchange for his pleading guilty to a single misdemeanor charge unrelated to the Espionage Act. At the sentencing hearing, Judge Richard D. Bennett said Drake and his family had gone through ""four years of hell,"" only to have prosecutors ultimately back down on all felony charges. ""This is not a sentence of incarceration,"" Bennett said. ""There's absolutely no way I'd put you in jail with respect to this offense."" The broad language of the Espionage Act criminalizes anyone who possesses information ""relating to the national defense"" and ""willfully"" communicates it to an unauthorized person. Under these terms, there is no distinction regarding a whistleblower's motivation. It does not matter whether that information is in the public interest, reveals wrongdoing, or generates policy debates. In 2020, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced the Espionage Act Reform Act to limit certain criminal offenses relating to leaking classified information. The bill would protect ""journalists who solicit, obtain, or publish government secrets"" and ""ensure that each member of Congress is equally able to receive classified information, including from whistleblowers."" Former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard in 2020 also introduced a bill to reform the Espionage Act when applied to government whistleblowers. The proposed legislation would have allowed defendants in Espionage Act cases to discuss intent and add a defense of disclosure in the public interest. Gabbard wrote in a Facebook post that her goal was to ensure ""that whistleblowers … who act in the public interest are protected and guaranteed their fair day in court."" At her trial, Reality Winner was not able to argue that she acted in the public interest, nor were her lawyers able to talk about the content of the document she leaked, which remains classified. If they had, they might have pointed to the impact the document had after it was published in The Intercept. The day after the NSA report was published, the Election Assistance Commission issued two statements. The first was an alert to state and local election officials that spelled out the top-secret email addresses ""utilized by the attackers"" and urged officials to ""check email logs."" The EAC, whose members at the time did not have security clearances, issued another release calling on other federal agencies for ""full disclosure of election security intelligence."" Former election officials at the federal and state level told 60 Minutes that, while they do not condone Winner's violating her security clearance, her leak helped contribute to more secure elections in 2018 and 2020. When Pelley asked Winner her motivation for leaking the NSA document, she told him she never meant to cause harm. ""My only intent,"" she said, ""was that maybe one person could restore the foundation of truth and integrity in a really tumultuous year.""

2022-07-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/british-spy-chief-predicts-russian-forces-will-soon-run-out-of-steam-in-ukraine/,"British spy chief predicts Russian forces will soon ""run out of steam"" in Ukraine","Head of the British intelligence service MI6 Richard Moore said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had thus far suffered a ""strategic defeat"" in Ukraine, failing to achieve any of what Moore described as three key objectives — removing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy from power, taking control of the country's capital, Kyiv, and sowing disunity within NATO. ""On all of those,"" he said, ""I think they count as epic fails."" Moore, who took part in a question-and-answer session at the annual Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado, predicted that Russian forces would be forced to regroup within ""the next few weeks,"" offering Ukraine a crucial window within which to make battlefield reversals. ""I think they're about to run out of steam,"" Moore said of the Russian military, adding that the U.K.'s assessment was that Russian forces ""will increasingly find it difficult to supply manpower and material over the next few weeks."" ""They will have to pause in some way and that will give the Ukrainians opportunities to strike back,"" Moore said. He added that the Ukrainians' ability to notch successes would serve as ""an important reminder to the rest of Europe: that this is a winnable campaign by the Ukrainians"" – especially ahead of what Moore said would be a ""pretty tough winter."" ""We're in for a tough time,"" he said. Still, he said Russia had been hampered since the start of the invasion by what he called a ""toxic combination"" of military miscalculation and intelligence failure. ""I don't think they're having a great war,"" Moore said. ""They clearly completely misunderstood Ukrainian nationalism. They completely underestimated the degree of resistance that the Russian military would face,"" he said. The Kremlin's intelligence shortcomings were now likely exacerbated by the expulsion, earlier this year, of more than 400 Russian intelligence officers from the European continent. ""We reckon in the U.K., that's probably reduced their ability to do their business to spy for Russian in Europe by half,"" Moore said. The British intelligence chief also echoed a more casual remark made at the same forum yesterday by CIA director William Burns, who quipped that Putin appeared ""entirely too healthy"" before noting that was not a formal U.S. intelligence assessment. Moore said Thursday that ""there's no evidence that Putin is suffering from serious ill health."" Like Burns, Moore also said China had been ""conservative"" in weighing whether to provide military assistance to Russia — though it had otherwise supported the Kremlin by purchasing Russian oil. ""[I]t feels pretty tight, but it's not an equal partnership, and Ukraine has made it less equal,"" Moore said. ""Moscow is very much the junior partner and the Chinese are very much in the driving seat."" He also said China's close observation of the West's approach to the conflict made it imperative to continue bolstering Ukrainian forces. ""[T]his is one of the reasons why it is so essential that we tough it out on Ukraine and we keep going through this winter and we help the Ukrainians to win, or at least negotiate from a position of significant strength,"" Moore said, ""is because Xi Jinping is watching this like a hawk.""",7,3.6921286122914614,4.955830195240296,-1.2637015829488343,3

Zelenskyy said he was firing Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova and security chief Ivan Bakanov amid a high number of cases of suspected treason by Ukrainian law enforcement officials. ""Today, I made the decision of relieving of their duties the prosecutor general and the head of Ukraine's security service,"" Zelenskyy said in his daily address to the nation. Zelenskyy said over 650 cases of suspected treason and aiding and abetting Russia by Ukrainian security officials are currently being investigated, including 60 cases of officials who have remained in territories occupied by Russia and are working against Ukraine. ""Such a great number of crimes against the foundations of national security and the connections established between Ukrainian law enforcement officials and Russian special services pose very serious questions to the relevant leaders,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Each such question will be answered."" Bakanov was a childhood friend of Zelenskyy's and a former business partner, The Associated Press reports. Zelenskyy tapped him to head the SBU (state security service). Bakanov was the target of increasing criticism about security breaches since the war started, the AP added.

2022-07-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-report-details-russian-torture-ukrainian-civilians/,New report details Russian torture of Ukrainian civilians,"Washington — An international investigation has found grim new evidence of war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, identifying cases of direct targeting of civilians, torture, rape and forced deportations. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional security organization, issued a report Thursday detailing ""clear patterns of serious violations of international humanitarian law"" committed mainly by the Russian army. The report describes in vivid detail the torture of Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops. In a summer camp in Bucha, just outside Ukraine's capital of Kyiv that was occupied for over two weeks by Russian forces, the investigators said they found a series of torture chambers. ""In Zabuchchya, a village in the Bucha district, 18 mutilated bodies of murdered men, women, and children were discovered in a basement: some had their ears cut off, while others had their teeth pulled out,"" according to the report. Speaking Thursday in Vienna, U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter described a Russian missile attack on the central city of Vinnytsia that killed more than 20 people, including 3 children, as ""disgusting,"" but ""a reality that we contend with each and every day."" Ukrainian emergency services showed images of a child's dead body lying on the ground next to a play stroller she had been pushing down the road with her mother when the missiles struck. In an interview with CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov called the strike the latest proof that his country is at war with ""a state of terrorists."" ""They're using that weapon against civilian people, against the civilian facilities, against the hospitals… against the kindergartens,"" he said. The OSCE report says that as Russia is increasingly unable to muster enough of its own forces, it has recently begun resorting to conscripting Ukrainian men between the ages 18-65 from territory it occupies and sending them straight to the front lines, with little to no training. ""The escalation, and rising casualty rates, have begun to spark anger even among pro-Russian communities. Several videos posted online purportedly show the wives of Donetsk and Luhansk conscripts demanding assistance for their husbands and asking why men with no military background are being sent to fight,"" according to the report. Incidences of gender-based violence have remained prevalent throughout the war, the report states. Natalia Karbowska, co-founder and director of strategic development for the Ukrainian Women's Fund, suggested during a June U.N. Security Council briefing that ""the Russian Federation is using sexual violence and rape as instruments of terror to control civilians."" In one instance, 25 girls aged 14 to 24 were allegedly kept in a basement in Bucha where they were gang-raped by Russian troops. Nine of the girls became pregnant, according to Ukraine's Commissioner for Human Rights. Russian President Vladimir Putin bestowed the honorary title of ""guard"" on the military unit accused of war crimes in Bucha, according to a Russian presidential decree. In a Facebook post, the Russian Embassy in the U.S. dismissed the report as an attempt by Washington ""to vilify the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,"" which it suggested was due to ""dissatisfaction with the success of a special military operation."" The Putin regime has consistently referred to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""military operation."" Referring to it as a war can land Russians in prison. The OSCE report also discusses ""filtration centers,"" set up by Russia's occupying forces, where Ukrainian civilians ""are separated from others and often simply disappear."" The report says detained individuals are handed over to authorities in the occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where some are sentenced to death. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for an immediate end to Russia's ""filtration"" operations and for the release of detained Ukrainian civilians. Russian authorities have deported between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens, deliberately separating Ukrainian children from their parents, according to the Biden administration. ""The unlawful transfer and deportation of protected persons is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and is a war crime,"" Blinken said in a statement Wednesday. ""Russian authorities must release those detained and allow Ukrainian citizens forcibly removed or coerced into leaving their country the ability to promptly and safely return home.""",45,4.09852563571666,6.552226057771868,-2.453700422055208,1
2022-07-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/log4j-cyber-safety-review-board-report/,"Panel finds notorious Log4j internet bug did not lead to any ""significant"" attacks on critical infrastructure","A panel of U.S. government officials and private-sector experts tasked with investigating the nation's major cybersecurity failures has concluded that the notorious Log4j internet bug did not prompt any ""significant"" attacks on critical infrastructure systems. A serious flaw living inside an open-source Java-based software known as ""Log4j"" shook the world last December when officials estimated that it left hundreds of millions of devices exposed to potential breaches. The fledgling Cyber Safety Review Board, loosely modeled off the National Transportation Safety Board and housed under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), released the findings of its investigation into the vulnerability on Thursday. Led by Chair Rob Silvers, the undersecretary for policy at DHS, and Vice Chair Heather Adkins, senior director of security engineering at Google, the new group, which draws its authority from an executive order signed by President Biden last year, determined in its inaugural report that the widespread vulnerability did not compromise critical infrastructure nor result in any ""high impact"" incidents by nation state actors. To date, ""exploitation of Log4j occurred at lower levels than many experts predicted, given the severity of the vulnerability,"" the report indicated. Still, the board's leaders warned the potential for breaches remains. ""I think our recommendation that people need to keep an eye on this emphasizes that this incident is not done and that we will continue to hear about new compromises going forward,"" Adkins said Wednesday during a briefing with reporters. Silvers cautioned, however, that the board is limited in its understanding of current exploits because critical infrastructure owners and operators are not yet required to report cyber breaches to the federal government. In March, Congress passed legislation requiring such incidents to be reported to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), but the agency has up to two years to start rulemaking, setting the program's parameters. ""The board noted that because there is currently no cyber incident reporting requirement in effect federally across critical infrastructure, we have potentially limited visibility into exploitation,"" Silvers said. Silvers vowed that CISA is working toward ""rapid implementation"" of the law to establish the new rules ""as quickly as possible.""' The board's 52-page report outlined a comprehensive timeline of events surrounding the discovery of the Log4j vulnerability, beginning in late-November 2021, when a researcher at the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba reported the flaw to its creators within the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). ""We believe the global community benefited from the security researcher at Alibaba, who followed coordinated vulnerability disclosure best practices by bringing the discovery of the vulnerability to the Apache Software Foundation, the open source foundation that maintains Log4j,"" Silvers told reporters Wednesday, applauding the cybersecurity expert who first brought the vulnerability to light. Silvers also revealed that the Cyber Safety Review Board reached out to the Chinese ambassador to the United States in an effort to better understand the Chinese government's correspondence with Alibaba. According to the report, the Chinese government informed the Board that Alibaba first reported the vulnerability to its Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on December 13, 2021, 19 days after the problem was disclosed to ASF. According to Reuters, China has penalized Alibaba for failing to report the Log4j vulnerability sooner, but the Chinese government declined a request from the board to provide more information on the sanctions, according to its report. Silvers said that China's ""lack of transparency"" only ""heightens concern"" among the board that ""China's regulatory regime will discourage network defenders from [disclosing vulnerabilities] with software developers"" in the future. ""Independent of a possible sanction against Alibaba, the Board noted troubling elements of MIIT's regulations governing disclosure of security vulnerabilities,"" the report added, suggesting that the Chinese government's requirement for providers to report vulnerabilities to them within two days of discovery ""could give the PRC government early knowledge of vulnerabilities before vendor fixes are made available to the community."" ""The Board is concerned this will afford the [Chinese] government a window in which to exploit vulnerabilities before network defenders can patch them. This is a disturbing prospect given the [Chinese] government's known track record of intellectual property theft, intelligence collection, surveillance of human rights activists and dissidents, and military cyber operations,"" the report continued. The report also outlined a series of recommendations for enhanced cybersecurity going forward, including a push for a better ""software ecosystem."" As part of that initiative, the board recommended further investments in open-source software security and urged software developers to generate a ""Software Bill of Materials,"" or ""SBOM,"" that can be shipped with their product. This catalog of sorts would be designed to let consumers know what sort of software lives inside their products and applications, somewhat akin to what a nutrition facts label does for food. ""Our observation is that organizations using open source software should be supporting that community directly – getting them access to training programs, developing the tool sets that will make things like SBOMs adoptable,"" Adkins told reporters. The 15-member panel dealt with nearly 80 organizations and individuals representing software developers, end users, security professionals, and companies to produce Thursday's report. Participants included Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, AT&T and Google, in addition to a slew of private companies, cybersecurity firms and scores of government agencies around the globe. The Cyber Safety Review Board was originally tasked with conducting a postmortem of the massive SolarWinds breach carried out by Russian hackers, but ultimately pivoted to studying the impact of the Log4j flaw. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called the cyber threat environment ""as diverse and critical as it's ever been,"" during Wednesday's briefing. ""We are seeing nation state cyber actors and cybercriminals, including those involved in ransomware operations, routinely use cyber means to steal data, gain financially and hold critical infrastructure at risk,"" the secretary added. CISA in February launched a ""shields up"" campaign to urge U.S. companies to safeguard against possible cyberattacks in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That warning has lasted for 150 days so far.",20,5.534290481509691,4.220069685881602,1.3142207956280894,16

At least 18 people died and about 60 were wounded in the Monday strike, according to Ukrainian officials, but Russia claims it only hit a legitimate military target near the mall. Video from security cameras in the area clearly caught the moment when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a Russian X-22 cruise missile slammed into the shopping center in the central city of Kremenchuk. A shockwave ripples across the area just before people in a park are seen falling to the ground and fleeing for cover. Emergency workers were still searching through the wreckage of the shopping center on Wednesday, with about 20 people still listed as missing. Zelenskyy shared another video that he said showed the X-22 rocket — a long-range cruise missile designed in the former Soviet Union to sink American aircraft carriers — flying at an angle into the mall, sending a huge fireball and debris flying in all directions. The Ukrainian leader pleaded on Tuesday for the United Nations to ""act immediately"" to ""hold Russia accountable"" for what he has described as a terrorist attack on his country. In his post sharing the video, Zelenskyy accused Russia of hitting the mall ""purposefully."" ""They wanted to kill as many people as possible in a peaceful city, in a regular shopping mall,"" he said. The security camera videos appear to debunk Russian propaganda spread online suggesting the attack was faked and that the Russian military only hit a military facility near the shopping center. Various Russian accounts have suggested the site targeted was a depot stocked with Western-supplied weapons or a base for Ukrainian military vehicles. CBS News visited the facility just north of the mall, however, and found an asphalt factory. We met Mykola Danyleiko, chairman of the board for the Kredmash Road Machinery Plant, which mixes asphalt to pave roads. ""It's fake,"" he told CBS News of the Russian claims. ""They said we send products from here by railroad. Do you see a railroad?"" The cement plant was hit by a missile on Monday, too, but there was no railway there. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed fire spread from its strike on the plant to the mall, causing the shopping center to burn down. But our team saw no burn path after walking the third of a mile between the two locations. Russian media also said the mall was ""non-operating"" at the time of the strike, but recent online videos suggest otherwise. And fear can't be faked: As we began interviewing a local woman near the mall a day after the strike, an air raid alert started beeping on her phone, and she bolted. She was clearly afraid of another Russian missile strike — which Moscow might again insist never happened. CBS News producer Barny Smith contributed to this report.",47,6.117959706838458,1.2092509166167869,4.908708790221671,20
2022-06-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-shopping-mall-russia-missile-strike-deaths-zelenskyy-terrorist-attack/,"Deaths mount as Ukraine calls Russian mall strike a ""terrorist attack""","Kremenchuk, Ukraine — Ukrainian emergency services personnel were still searching through the rubble on Tuesday of a shopping mall hit by a Russian missile strike, hoping to find any survivors as the death toll climbed to 18. Officials said at least 36 people were still missing. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy labelled the Monday strike on the mall in the central city of Kremenchuk a ""terrorist attack,"" and the country's prosecutor general said it was a ""crime against humanity."" While Russia has claimed the mall was closed at the time of the strike, Zelenksyy said around 1,000 people were inside it when the missile hit. The president said it was a targeted strike by Russia against innocent civilians. CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio was at the scene on Tuesday morning. He said the Amstor shopping mall had been reduced to a charred carcass of its former self. As thick smoke swirled from the building on Monday afternoon, police shouted for people to find shelter while firefighters raced to put out the inferno and bystanders helped load victims into ambulances. Soon, people started gathering to pore over lists posted on walls, looking for the names of missing loved ones. At the local hospital, a wounded Mykola Mykhailets, said he'd seen ""lots of wounded people, burned people, some covered in blood."" His wife Ludmyla was also wounded in the strike. Laying in a hospital bed next to her husband, she said the blast threw her into the air. ""It's really scary,"" she said. ""I'd tell women who left the country with their kids, don't come back."" President Joe Biden and the other G7 leaders were meeting in the German Alps when the missile struck. They called the attack ""abominable"" and promised nearly $30 billion in new aid for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has issued repeated, urgent requests for more modern weaponry to help Ukraine's forces defend the country from Russia's invasion, which has made gains in the eastern Donbas recently. Ukraine has asked for, among other things, advanced missile defense systems, to help shoot down incoming missiles like the one that hit the mall in Kremenchuk. The front line in the war, in the Donbas, is just over 100 miles to the east of the smoldering ruins of the shopping center, and Ukrainians know it's a matter of when, not if, Russian rockets will strike again.",47,4.1131929865974435,3.3690872822562548,0.7441057043411887,23

Zelenskky said that many of the more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and staff inside the mall managed to escape. Giant plumes of black smoke, dust and orange flames emanated from the wreckage, with emergency crews rushing in to search broken metal and concrete for victims and put out fires. Onlookers watched in distress at the sight of how an everyday activity such as shopping could turn into a horror. The casualty figures were changing as rescuers searched the smoldering rubble into early Tuesday. Ukraine's emergency services reported late Monday that at least 16 people were dead and about 60 wounded. Soldiers worked into the night to lug sheets of twisted metal and broken concrete, as one drilled into what remained of the shopping center's roof. Drones whirred above, clouds of dark smoke still emanating from the ruins several hours after the fire had been put out. ""We are working to dismantle the construction so that it is possible to get machinery in there since the metal elements are very heavy and big, and disassembling them by hand is impossible,"" said Volodymyr Hychkan, an emergency services official. At Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack. In the first Russian government comment on the missile strike, the country's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyansky, alleged multiple inconsistencies that he didn't specify, claiming on Twitter that the incident was a provocation by Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilian infrastructure, even though Russian attacks have hit other shopping malls, theaters, hospitals, kindergartens and apartment buildings. The strike unfolded as the leaders of the world's major economies get ready to pursue new sanctions on Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods. Meanwhile, the U.S. prepared to announce the purchase of an advanced surface-to-air missile system for Kyiv, and NATO planned to increase the size of its rapid-reaction forces nearly eightfold to 300,000 troops. Zelenskyy said the target presented ""no threat to the Russian army"" and had ""no strategic value."" He accused Russia of sabotaging ""people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry."" The Ukrainian military said the shopping center was hit by missiles fired by Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers from the skies over Russia's western Kursk region. The secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said that one missile hit the shopping center and another struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk. The Russian strike carried echoes of attacks earlier in the war that caused large numbers of civilian casualties — such as one in March on a Mariupol theater where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that left at least 59 people dead. ""Russia continues to take out its impotence on ordinary civilians. It is useless to hope for decency and humanity on its part,"" Zelenskyy said. Mayor Vitaliy Maletskiy wrote on Facebook that the attack ""hit a very crowded area, which is 100% certain not to have any links to the armed forces."" The attack happened as Russia was mounting an all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk province, ""pouring fire"" on the city of Lysychansk from the ground and air, according to the local governor. Russian forces appeared to step up an offensive centering on trying to wrest the eastern Donbas region from Ukraine after forcing government troops out of the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk in recent days. Western leaders, meanwhile, pledged steadfast and continued support for Kyiv. NATO will agree to deliver further military support to Ukraine — including secure communication and anti-drone systems — when its leaders convene in Spain for a summit, according to the military alliance's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg. To the west of Lysychansk on Monday, the mayor of the city of Sloviansk — potentially the next major battleground — said Russian forces fired cluster munitions on the city after dawn, including one that hit a residential neighborhood. Authorities said the number of dead and wounded had yet to be confirmed. The Associated Press saw one fatality: A man's body lay hunched over a car door frame, his blood pooling onto the ground from chest and head wounds. The blast blew out most windows in the surrounding apartment blocks and the cars parked below, littering the ground with broken glass. ""Everything is now destroyed. We are the only people left living in this part of the building. There is no power,"" said local resident Valentina Vitkovska, in tears as she spoke about the blast. ""I can't even call to tell others what had happened to us."" Overall, Zelenskyy's office said at least six civilians were killed and 31 others wounded as part of intense Russian shelling against various Ukrainian cities over the past 24 hours — including Kyiv and major cities in the country's south and east, but not counting the attack in Kremenchuk and the shelling of the eastern city of Kharkiv where at least three people were killed and another 15 were wounded. It said Russian forces fired rockets that killed two people and wounded five overnight in and near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and continued to target the key southern port of Odesa. A missile attack destroyed residential buildings and wounded six people, including a child, it said. In Lysychansk, at least five high-rise buildings in the city and the last road bridge were damaged over the past day, the regional governor said. A crucial highway linking the city to government-held territory to the south was rendered impassable by shelling. The city had a prewar population of around 100,000, approximately one-tenth of whom remain. Analysts say that Lysychansk's location high on the banks of the Siverskiy Donets River gives a major advantage to the city's Ukrainian defenders. ""It's a very hard nut to crack. The Russians could spend many months and much effort storming Lysychansk,"" said military analyst Oleh Zhdanov. In other developments, in Germany's Bavarian Alps, leaders of the Group of Seven countries unveiled plans to seek new sanctions and pledged to continue supporting Ukraine ""for as long as it takes."" In a joint statement on Monday after they held a session by video link with Zelenskyy, the leaders underlined their ""unwavering commitment to support the government and people of Ukraine in their courageous defense of their country's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" The U.S. appeared ready to respond to Zelenskyy's call for more air defense systems after Russian troops hit Kyiv with long-range missiles on Sunday. Washington was expected to announce the purchase of an advanced surface-to-air missile system for Ukraine. In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced the plans to greatly expand the alliance's rapid-reaction forces as part of its response to an ""era of strategic competition."" The NATO response force currently has about 40,000 soldiers. Britian's defense ministry said Russia is likely to rely increasingly on reserve forces in the coming weeks of the war. Analysts have said a call-up of reservists by Russia could vastly alter the balance in the war but could also come with political consequences for President Vladimir Putin's government. Meanwhile, senior Biden administration officials have confirmed to CBS News that the White House is planning to announce this week the purchase of an advanced medium- to long-range surface-to-air missile defense system for Ukraine. CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe said Washington was expected to promise more artillery shells and radar systems, too, as it tries to meet the urgent requests coming from Ukraine's leaders. Mr. Biden and his fellow G-7 leaders, meeting Monday in Germany, were likely to hear a fresh appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy, who was to address them virtually from Kyiv. He told his own country on Sunday night, in a daily video address, that Ukraine needed military, financial and humanitarian assistance immediately to fight back against Russia's invasion. As CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio reports from the Ukrainian capital, Russia shattered weeks of relative calm in Kyiv by firing a volley of long-range missiles at the city early Sunday morning. It was an apparent show-of-force by the Kremlin as the Western leaders gathered in Germany to strengthen their military and economic support for Ukraine.",47,1.878220324101691,4.792612261495373,-2.914391937393682,11
2022-06-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-aid-package-long-range-rocket-systems-this-week/,$450 million aid package for Ukraine includes four more long-range rocket systems,"The White House announced Thursday a $450 million assistance package for Ukraine that includes four more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) as the fight with Russia in the Donbas grinds on. The four HIMARS the U.S. announced in a previous aid package arrived in Ukraine this week. In the battle in eastern Ukraine, the Russians have a numerical advantage when it comes to firepower. To help Ukraine, the U.S. first sent Howitzers and have since started sending the longer-range and more accurate HIMARS. In addition to HIMARS, the package announced Thursday includes 36,000 rounds of ammunition, tactical vehicles, 2,000 machine guns and over 1,000 grenade launchers. The U.S. has now committed about $6.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of Russia's invasion. In announcing the first shipment that included HIMARS, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Dr. Colin Kahl said, ""The HIMARS, and the guided munitions that go along with them will allow Ukraine to range any target they need for that fight inside Ukrainian territory."" Ukrainian leaders assured the U.S. that the systems would not be used to strike into Russia. The munitions sent by the U.S. with the first shipment of HIMARS have a range of up to 70 kilometers, more than twice the range of M777 Howitzers, but less than the long-range Advanced Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) that can reach hundreds of kilometers. ""We don't assess that they need systems that range out hundreds and hundreds of kilometers for the current fight, and so that's how we settled on it,"" Kahl said earlier this month. Since Ukrainian forces don't use HIMARS, the U.S. organized training that takes about three weeks for Ukrainians outside of Ukraine. The U.S. prepositioned the four HIMARS in Europe so training could start quickly, and the first 60 Ukrainians graduated from training last week. The HIMARS are a priority for Ukraine, which is losing 100 soldiers a day. The HIMARS provide more precision-guided targeting with extended range so the Ukrainians can hit high-valued Russian targets from farther away. Russia is also taking significant losses despite its numerical superiority. The Russian Defense Ministry hasn't given estimated casualties for months, but Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said last week that Russia has lost between 20-30% of its armored forces and has ""suffered a tremendous amount of casualties."" The fight in the east has been described as a street-by-street battle that could take months, if not years. The U.S. has provided more than $5.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded Ukraine. Congress recently approved a $40 billion security package for Ukraine that will allow for more aid shipments through the summer.",49,3.7936018097113324,2.2981942682938605,1.495407541417472,5

""I am here to express the unwavering support of the United States for the people of Ukraine in the midst of the unprovoked and unjust Russian invasion,"" Garland told the press in attendance, adding he and Venediktova were gathering to continue discussions on war crimes in Ukraine. ""The United States is sending an unmistakable message. There is no place to hide. We and our partners will pursue every avenue available to make sure that those who are responsible for these atrocities are held accountable,"" said the Attorney General. While Garland and Venediktova were meeting, the Justice Department said Garland announced the creation of the War Crimes Accountability team, which will take part in the investigation of potential war crimes in Ukraine that fall under U.S. jurisdiction. In March, an American journalist was killed and another was wounded by Russian forces in the town of Irpin outside the capital of Kyiv as they were traveling to film refugees. That same month, a Fox News cameraman and a local producer working for the network were killed in an attack that left the network's correspondent Benjamin Hall injured as they reported near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Led by former Director of the Office Of Special Investigations and one-time Nazi war crime prosecutor Eli Rosenbaum, the initiative will ""centralize and strengthen the Justice Department's ongoing work to hold accountable those who have committed war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine,"" according to a release from the Justice Department. The attorney general also announced his department will provide Ukraine with a federal prosecutor to advise on combatting kleptocracy and corruption. Earlier this year, the Justice Department launched Task Force KleptoCature aimed at targeting the assets of Russian oligarchs who seek to evade U.S. sanctions and trade policies against Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Recently, a megayacht was seized after officials determined it belonged to sanctioned gold mining billionaire Suleiman Kerimov and two jets allegedly belonging to oligarch Roman Abramovich were accused of violating U.S. restrictions. The previously unannounced meeting between the two chief law enforcement officers comes after Garland has been outspoken about the U.S.'s role in investigating potential war crimes in Ukraine. ""This Department has a long history of helping to hold accountable those who perpetrate war crimes,"" Garland told the press earlier this year. ""We are assisting international efforts to identify and hold accountable those responsible for atrocities in Ukraine. And we will continue to do so.' Earlier this month, Garland met with European Union Commissioner for Justice and Consumer Affairs Didier Reynders in Washington, D.C.

President Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the new aid package in a phone call on Wednesday, according to the White House. The aid includes additional artillery and coastal defense weapons, as well as ammunition for the artillery and advanced rocket systems. The $1 billion is sourced from two types of security aid. About $350 million of it is a drawdown of weapons from Defense Department inventory, and $650 million is sourced from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funds used to procure industry contracts to make weapons. Two vehicle-mounted launchers for Harpoon anti-ship missiles will be procured using the USAI funds and should be available to Ukraine in a few months, according to a defense official. The announcement of new aid comes as the Ukrainians and Russians are in a fierce fight in the east of Ukraine, in the Donbas region. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley presided over a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels on Wednesday. The meeting of more than 45 countries focused on how to provide Ukraine with the aid it needs. One of the items the Ukrainians have asked for is multiple launch rocket systems in order to provide them more standoff from the barrage of Russian artillery. Earlier in June, the U.S. pledged four high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) to Ukraine and prepositioned them in Europe so Ukrainians could conduct training. About 60 Ukrainians completed training Wednesday, and the systems should be in Ukraine by the end of the month. The fighting in the east is a block-by-block fight in most cases, with the Russians taking one street and the Ukrainians fighting to take it back. The city of Severodonetsk in the Luhansk region has been the site of significant recent fighting. Milley told reporters Wednesday that about three-quarters of the city were in Russian control, ""but the Ukrainians are fighting them street-by-street, house-by-house, and it's not a done deal."" He said both sides are taking significant losses. For instance, the reported estimate that Ukraine is losing 100 soldiers a day is in the ballpark of U.S. estimates, according to Milley. At the same time, he said the Russians have lost about 20-30% of their armored force, which is significant.",49,2.0477893507052576,2.781269617234977,-0.7334802665297193,27

(CW44 News At 10 | CNN) -- The Biden administration announced on Wednesday it was providing an additional $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine to fight Russia, a package that includes shipments of additional howitzers, ammunition and coastal defense systems. US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday ahead of the announcement, which the Pentagon said included providing Ukraine with 18 howitzers, 36,000 rounds of howitzer ammunition and two Harpoon coastal defense systems. ""I informed President Zelensky that the United States is providing another $1 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, including additional artillery and coastal defense weapons, as well as ammunition for the artillery and advanced rocket systems that the Ukrainians need to support their defensive operations in the Donbas,"" Biden said in a statement after the call. ""We also discussed Secretary Austin's efforts in Brussels today to coordinate additional international support for the Ukrainian armed forces."" Speaking in Brussels, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US and Ukraine are ""working in lockstep to meet Ukraine's requests for new capabilities, especially its need for long-range fires, armor and coastal defense."" The latest weapons package comes as Ukraine's military is burning through its Soviet-era ammunition, while Ukrainian officials have pleaded with the West to send additional heavy weaponry as the war with Russia girds on. Western intelligence and military officials believe the war is at a critical stage that could determine the long-term outcome of the conflict, while Russia has amassed a significant artillery advantage around two key cities in eastern Ukraine. Zelensky thanked Biden on Wednesday for his ""consistent, unwavering support"" and for mobilizing the international security, according to a statement from the Ukrainian president's office. ""The security support from the United States is unprecedented. It brings us closer to a common victory over the Russian aggressor,"" Zelensky said. A Pentagon spokesman said the US has now committed more than $5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February. The latest tranche of weapons includes ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, and tactical vehicles ""to recover equipment,"" as well as thousands of secure radios and thousands of night vision devices, thermal sightsand ""other optics,"" the Pentagon said. The package is expected to include weapons and supplies that can be quickly shipped from existing US stockpiles as well as issuing new contracts for long term supplies for The US will also provide $225 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, which Biden said will go toward ""supplying safe drinking water, critical medical supplies and health care, food, shelter, and cash for families to purchase essential items."" Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley on Wednesday were in Brussels, where a meeting was held with a working group of nearly 50 countries to discuss the crisis. The US has sent a number of weapons shipments to Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in February, increasing the capabilities that it's provided to Ukraine's military as the conflict has continued. Ukrainian officials, however, have been pushing for more heavy weaponry and have expressed frustrations that munitions appear to be trickling into the fight piecemeal. Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Tuesday that the country has only received 10% of the military assistance Kyiv has requested from the West. ""Whatever efforts we put, no matter how professional our army is, without the assistance of our Western partners Ukraine will not be able to win this war,"" Mailar said. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Milley pushed back on the notion that Ukraine wasn't getting what is needed, saying he was in regular contact with his Ukrainian counterpart. ""The speed that we have delivered security assistance is without comparison,"" Milley said. ""From the time the requests are validated and authorized, it is only a matter of days until the requirement is sourced, shipped and in the hands of the Ukrainians. In some cases, it may take a week, but most of the time, it's measured in days."" Milley added that ""in warfare, no weapons system is a silver bullet, ever."" ""So no weapons system, singular weapons system ever, quote unquote turns the balance,"" Milley said If the Ukrainians use the weapons systems that the US and other allies are providing properly, Milley said, ""They ought to be able to take out a significant amount of targets."" Milley said that despite Russian forces outnumbering and outgunning the Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region, Russian consolidation of its control in eastern Ukraine was ""not a done deal."" ""There are no inevitabilities in war. War takes many, many turns. So I wouldn't say it's an inevitability,"" he said, before granting that ""the numbers clearly favor the Russians."" Milley said that the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk ""is probably three quarters taken or so by Russian forces"" but that ""the Ukrainians are fighting them street by street, house by house."" Milley also characterized the current phase of the war as a ""very severe battle of attrition, almost World War I-like,"" noting how Russian progress in the region has been ""very slow, a very tough slog."" ""The Russians have run into a lot of problems. They've got command-and-control issues, logistics issues. They've got morale issues, leadership issues and a wide variety of other issues,"" Milley said. ""And the Russians have suffered tremendous amounts of casualties.""

She said those reports ""include horrific accounts of sexual violence."" ""Growing evidence of sexual violence is emerging by day from de-occupied areas,"" said Albania's U.N. Ambassador Ferit Hoxha, who hosted the Council meeting. ""We know now from the findings in the liberated towns and cities in Kyiv Oblast that civilians have been targeted, tortured, killed on a large scale, and that women and girls have been subjects of rape as a weapon of war."" Thomas-Greenfield said Russian forces were ""wielding sexual violence as a weapon of war,"" and that the U.S. government had received reports ""that Russian soldiers raped Ukrainian women for hours — and then killed them."" In April, Ukrainian lawmaker Kira Rudyk told CBS News that sexual violence was being used systematically ""in all the areas that were occupied by the Russians."" The U.N.'s special envoy for sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, said the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights' monitoring team in the country had already evaluated 124 reports received from across Ukraine of alleged conflict-related sexual violence targeting women, girls, men and boys in the regions of Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Zakarpattia and Zhytomyr. In grim detail, Patten outlined first-hand accounts given by Ukrainians to a national hotline over less than three months of war, including rape, gang rape, pregnancy following rape, attempted rape, threats of rape, coercion to watch an act of sexual violence committed against a partner or a child, and forced nudity. Addressing the Council on Monday, European Commission President Charles Michel called the violence against Ukrainian civilians ""shameful acts… in a shameful war,"" which he said ""must be exposed to the light of day and prosecuted."" Michel told Council members that Russia was singularly responsible for the current global food supply crisis. ""Let us be honest: The Kremlin is using food supplies as a stealth missile against developing countries,"" said the senior European official. ""The dramatic consequences of Russia's war are spilling over across the globe. This is driving up food prices, pushing people into poverty, and destabilizing entire regions."" Michel said he'd seen ""millions of tons of grain and wheat stuck in containers and ships"" during a recent visit to the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa, blaming Russian warships in the Black Sea, Russia's attacks on transport infrastructure, and ""Russia's tanks, bombs and mines that are preventing Ukraine from planting and harvesting."" As Michel continued to lambast Russia for the ""barbaric"" war, Moscow's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia — who in his own statement to the Council dismissed the accusations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers as lies — walked out in protest. ""You may leave the room,"" Michel said as he left. ""Maybe it's easier not to listen to the truth, dear ambassador."" Russia's Deputy Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy later said Nebenzia had left because the European Commission chief was making ""unsubstantiated claims, many of which have been already debunked.""",45,5.1010056937426445,6.448241965552601,-1.3472362718099564,1

As analysts probe recent tragedies in search of common factors or motives, researchers have uncovered a disturbing trend among gunmen of fatal mass shootings, nationwide. Since 2018, six of the nine deadliest mass shootings in the United States have been carried out by gunmen 21 years of age or younger. ""With individuals who are younger in age, committing these attacks, we think — and this is something we're still looking at — access to content online is really fueling those personal grievances and often inaccurate misperceptions about current events,"" a senior homeland security official told reporters during a briefing this week. ""It's really difficult for younger individuals to navigate the internet and understand what is considered to be credible information that they're consuming."" Among the conspiracy theories inspiring grievances is an unfounded notion of ""great replacement"" or ""white genocide"" that falsely claims, ""minorities, multiculturalists, and a ruling elite are deliberately threatening the existence of the white race,"" according to the bulletin. The ""racist, anti-Black, and anti-Semitic"" sentiment and longtime source of terror resurfaced in public dialogue after fueling a series of mass shootings, including the attack in Buffalo, New York, that killed 10 people at a supermarket in the city's predominantly Black east side. The accused gunman posted online that shoppers he targeted came from a culture that sought to ""ethnically replace my own people."" ""The alleged 2019 attacker at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas cited similar grievances and inspiration for the attack, and both the Buffalo and El Paso attackers indicated they were inspired by the 2019 attacker of two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand,"" DHS cautioned in its latest National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) bulletin, reiterating its concerns about ideological beliefs that prompt copycat attacks. In 2018, a gunman who in an online screed had blamed Jewish people for allowing immigrant ""invaders"" into the United States shot and killed 11 worshipers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. ""As recent acts of violence in communities across the country have so tragically demonstrated, the nation remains in a heightened threat environment, and we expect that environment will become more dynamic in the coming months,"" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. ""The Department of Homeland Security remains steadfast in our commitment to provide timely information and resources to the American public and our partners across every level of government, in law enforcement, and in the private sector."" But the spike in online threats has left investigators and analysts with an obstacle: determining which posts to extremist-aligned internet forums present real threats, or in law enforcement terms, may be considered ""specific and credible."" ""The way the threat has manifested itself makes it difficult to determine what is really specific and credible,"" the DHS official said. ""Many violent extremists often act alone using simple tactics. They radicalize to violence based on information they are often consuming via the internet."" The official continued, ""They mobilize to violence based on their perceptions about emerging or current events, and when they do that, they give little to no warning. So, it makes it difficult for us to really understand to what extent someone is intent on committing these attacks."" Beyond the challenge of labeling calls to violence as ""specific"" or ""credible,"" law enforcement officials are increasingly faced with another problem. ""We're seeing more kinds of actors,"" the DHS official said. ""Different types of actors that have different personal or ideological grievances [are] respond[ing] to events that we haven't seen in the past."" Most recently, that has translated into individuals from across the ideological spectrum attempting to use the Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court majority draft opinion — which appeared to indicate the Supreme Court is set to overturn Roe v. Wade — to mobilize or encourage violence. ""[W]e're concerned that grievances related to restricting abortion access in general could fuel a broader response, not just from violent extremists who are pro-choice, but individuals that are motivated by racial or ethnic beliefs… [who have] worldviews on things like the 'white genocide' or other conspiracy theories associated with the superiority of the white race and how they could exploit this environment again to promote violence."" But the Supreme Court's looming decision isn't the only current event on the radar of homeland security officials. The NTAS advisory also concluded that calls for violence by domestic violent extremists ""directed at democratic institutions, political candidates, party offices, election events, and election workers will likely increase,"" during midterm elections. ""The extent to which individuals may still hold grievances associated with the 2020 general election, or any continued misinformation or conspiracy theories that are promulgated around those midterm elections… people may feel like they need to commit acts of violence to respond to the to the election season or the outcome of those elections,"" the DHS official said. ""So certainly, at least through the fall, we're keeping an eye on that."" The department warned that ""foreign actors"" could also seize on midterms ""to sow discord and influence U.S. audiences in keeping with practices during previous election cycles."" The new bulletin expands on an NTAS bulletin released in February that was set to expire on Tuesday. Amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, analysts also registered that ""Russia and other actors have also amplified conspiracy theories alleging U.S. responsibility for the Russia-Ukraine crisis and claiming U.S. support for bioweapons labs abroad. Some of these actors have used these conspiracy theories to justify calls for violence against U.S. officials and institutions."" The false and baseless claim that Ukraine was developing biological weapons with the help of the U.S. government labs began to gain steam on Twitter in the aftermath of the Russian invasion. Tuesday's bulletin highlighted other foreign terrorist-linked efforts to amplify the New York City subway shooting in April 2022, whereby an individual wearing a gas mask threw two smoke canisters and opened fire a train platform at rush hour, resulting in injuries to dozens of individuals. In 2022, DHS provided $250 million in funding to support non-profits at high risk of terrorist attack, including places of worship, harden physical security. Mayorkas has proposed raising grant allocations to $360 million total in fiscal year 2023. DHS also awarded 37 grants amounting to $20 million as part of its Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) Program in 2021, designed to assist local communities in combating extremist threats. ""Our focus is to empower the whole community, be it folks that are working in the school, the school administrators, the counselors, the faith leaders… to be engaged with these individuals,"" another senior DHS official noted when probed on how the federal government plans to mitigate the threat of future attacks. The official stressed that community members will be ""the first ones that are going to potentially identify an individual that is going down a path of violence."" The Biden administration has issued more than 100 intelligence products related to domestic violent extremism, according to a senior DHS official, including six NTAS bulletins. The latest one is set to expire on Nov. 30, 2022.",20,6.195836151347416,5.36373913802442,0.8320970133229961,29
2022-06-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-recovers-bodies-azovstal-steel-plant-mariupol-commander-says/,"Ukraine recovers bodies from steelworks siege in Mariupol, commander says","Russia has begun turning over the bodies of Ukrainian fighters killed at the Azovstal steelworks, the fortress-like plant in the destroyed city of Mariupol where their last-ditch stand became a symbol of resistance against Moscow's invasion. Dozens of fighters' bodies recovered from the bombed-out mill's now Russian-occupied ruins have been transferred to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where DNA testing is underway to identify the remains, said Maksym Zhorin, a military commander and former leader of the Azov Regiment. The Azov Regiment was among the Ukrainian units that defended the factory for nearly three months before surrendering. It isn't clear how many bodies might still remain at the plant, which was relentlessly pounded by surrounding Russian forces from the ground, air and sea. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to fight for control of Sievierodonetsk, an eastern Ukrainian city that is key to Moscow's goal of completing the capture of the industrial Donbas region. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow's forces also intend to capture the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, home to more than 700,000 people, a move that could severely weaken Ukraine's standing and allow the Russian military to advance closer to the center of the country. ""In the Zaporizhzhia region ... there is the most threatening situation there,"" Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian fighters' dogged defense of the steel mill frustrated the Kremlin's objective of quickly capturing Mariupol and tied down Russian forces in the strategic port city. The last Azovstal holdouts finally relinquished the plant in May, marching out without weapons and carrying their wounded. The survivors' fate in Russian hands is shrouded in uncertainty. Zelenskyy said more than than 2,500 fighters who defended the plant are being held prisoner by the Russians, and Ukraine is working on getting them released. The recovery of the fighters' remains from the Azovstal ruins has not been announced by the Ukrainian government, and Russian officials have not commented. But relatives of soldiers killed at the plant discussed the process with The Associated Press. The Ukrainian government's Ministry for Reintegration of Occupied Territories on Saturday announced the first officially confirmed swap of their military dead since the war began. It said the two sides exchanged 320 bodies in all, each getting back 160 sets of remains. It gave no details on where the bodies were recovered from. The exchange took place Thursday on the front line in the Zaporizhzhia region. The Avoz Regiment is a National Guard unit that grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that arose to fight Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The Azov Battalion drew initial fighters from far-right circles. Zhorin, the former Azov Regiment leader now co-commanding a Kyiv-based military unit, confirmed that remains recovered from Azovstal were among those exchanged in the swap. The brother of an Azov fighter missing and feared dead in the steelworks told the AP that at least two trucks of bodies from Azovstal were transferred to a military hospital in Kyiv for identification. Viacheslav Drofa said the remains of his elder brother, Dmitry Lisen, did not appear to be among those recovered so far. Bodies were recovered last week from the mill and some were severely burned, he said. The mother of a soldier killed in a Russian airstrike on the plant said the Azov Regiment telephoned her and said that her son's body might be among those that were transferred to Kyiv. The mother did not want her or her son to be identified by name, saying she feared that discussing the recovery process might disrupt it. She tearfully referred to her son as a hero. ""I'm just waiting for the body of my son,"" she said. ""It's important for me to bury him in our Ukrainian land."" In other developments Monday, Ukraine's efforts to resist Russia's invasion loomed large over D-Day commemorations in France, where the 78th anniversary of the Normandy invasion was marked. ""The fight in Ukraine is about honoring these veterans of World War II,"" Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the American Cemetery of Colleville-sur-Mer, overlooking Omaha Beach in Normandy. He added: ""It's about maintaining the so-called global rules-based international order that was established by the dead who are buried here at this cemetery."" American D-Day veteran Charles Shay, 97, was at Omaha Beach to mark the the anniversary of the June 6, 1944, landings and pay tribute to those who fell that day. Asked about the war raging on the European continent, Shay said, ""It is a very sad situation."" ""In 1944 I landed on these beaches, and we thought we'd bring peace to the world. But it's not possible,"" he added. Meanwhile, the president of Ukraine's separatist Donetsk People's Republic said that the region's supreme court is opening the trial of three British men alleged to have been mercenaries for Ukrainian forces. If convicted on the charges, including of trying to seize power, the men could face the death penalty. Russia also continued to pummel targets in Ukraine. Russian warplanes fired long-range missiles to destroy a plant on the edge of the town of Lozova in the northeastern Kharkiv region that was repairing armored vehicles, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. Russian aircraft hit 73 areas of concentration of Ukrainian troops and equipment, while the Russian artillery struck 431 military targets, Konashenkov said. His claims couldn't be independently verified. Ukrainian forces put up resistance in Sievierodonetsk. There are more of them, they are more powerful, but we have every chance to fight on this direction,"" Zelenskyy said.",47,4.859251656499026,2.408239527638668,2.4510121288603584,19
2022-06-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-timeline-100-days/,100 days of Russia's war in Ukraine: A timeline,"Friday marks the 100th day since Russia launched the invasion of Ukraine intent on taking over the country quickly and overthrowing democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for a puppet government loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. As the war has grown longer and costlier than the Kremlin expected, the Russians have pursued smaller and smaller goals. After failing to take Kyiv, the Russian forces have zeroed in on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting since 2014. The Ukrainians, with the help of Western allies, have held off Russia over the past 100 days, but it remains to be seen how many more days the fight will continue. Here is a timeline of some of the key events in the past 100 days of the invasion: Russian forces ""uncoiling"" After weeks of warning a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent, the Biden administration assessed Putin had made the decision to invade. While traveling in Lithuania, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces were ""uncoiling and now poised to strike."" Invasion starts Early in the morning on February 24, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion started with about 100 missiles fired from both land- and sea-based platforms, and then with ground incursions on three main axes of assault: in the north, from Belarus down towards Kyiv; in the east, from western Russia down towards Kharkiv; and in the south, from Crimea up to Kherson. The U.S. intelligence assessment was that Russia planned to install a puppet government in Kyiv. Ukrainian Resistance From the start of the invasion, Russians faced greater resistance from Ukrainians than they had anticipated and suffered logistical setbacks. For instance, already, the Pentagon assessed the Russians were having to expend more fuel than they had planned for in the north. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy started posting social media video addresses from the capital asking for help from the international community. He reportedly turned down another nation's offer to evacuate him from Kyiv by saying, ""I need more ammunition, not a ride."" Stalled in the North About a week into the war, the Pentagon characterized the Russian advance in the north around Kyiv, Chernhiv and Kharkiv as ""stalled."" The Russians never made it closer than about 15 kilometers from Kyiv and stayed at this distance until retreating to focus on the Donbas. In the south, Russia made more progress because its supply lines ran from Crimea, where they've had a presence since 2014. The Russians conducted the only amphibious assault of the invasion so far early on, putting troops from the Sea of Azov near the town of Berdyansk. The Russians captured Berdyansk in March as they worked towards the strategic city of Mariupol. Russian repositioning On March 25, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced it would focus on ""fully liberating"" the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Russian battalion tactical groups began to pull out of Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy back into Russia to be refitted and resupplied for the fight in the Donbas. Bucha Massacre As the Russians withdrew from around Kyiv, evidence of brutal atrocities started to emerge. In the town of Bucha, Ukrainian officials said the Russians cruelly killed an estimated dozens of civilians, many of whom were shot in the head while their wrists were tied behind their back. Ukrainian officials also said several mass graves were discovered in Bucha after the Russian retreat. The graves combined with the images of murdered corpses lining the streets in Bucha horrified the international community and prompted Biden again to call Putin ""a war criminal."" Gen. Dvornikov Seven weeks into the invasion, Putin appointed General Alexander Dvornikov to lead the invasion in what was seen by many as an attempt to fix all the screwups at the front. Before his appointment, Russia did not have an overall commander-in-charge of the invasion. Dvornikov was nicknamed the ""butcher of Syria"" because of his disregard for civilian harm while in charge of Russian forces in Syria. It's unclear what effect he has had on the campaign in Ukraine so far. The head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, estimated in Senate testimony in May that between 8 and 10 Russian generals had been killed in Ukraine so far. Heavier security assistance As the Russians began to prioritize the Donbas, the U.S. and other countries shifted the type of assistance to Ukraine in preparation for a long slog of a fight in the Donbas. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate panel in early April that ""The fight down in the southeast, the terrain is different than it is in the north. It is much more open and -- and lends itself to armored mechanized offensive operations on both sides."" On April 13, the Biden administration committed to sending M777 Howitzers to Ukraine, the heaviest piece of weaponry the U.S. had committed up until this point. In addition to the weapons, the U.S. began training Ukrainians on the Howitzers in locations outside of Ukraine. The training was another step beyond what the administration had done previously. Since then, the U.S. has continued to provide heavier equipment and more training for the Ukrainians. Sinking of the Moskva On April 14, the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, sank. The Ukrainians had struck it the day before with two Neptune anti-ship missiles. The ship initially battled a huge fire and eventually sank in the Black Sea. The Moskva was the ship Ukrainians reportedly told to ""f*** off"" in February when it approached Snake Island and demanded Ukrainians surrender. Kharkiv Counteroffensive The Ukrainians launched a counteroffensive in Kharkiv in early May and have successfully pushed the Russians back gradually toward the border. The Ukrainians have attempted counter offensives in other parts of the country too, including in the south around Kherson. The situation elsewhere, and especially in the Donbas, is less clear in this period, with Russians taking control of a hamlet or village one day and then losing control of it to Ukrainians on the next day. Azovstal and the fall of Mariupol Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers and trapped civilians ended their defense of the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant. The soldiers and many civilians had taken refuge in the plant in part because of its vast underground tunnels and defended the compound for weeks against Russian attacks. On May 16, the Ukrainians negotiated with Russian forces to leave the plant. The end of the Azovstal battle brought most of Mariupol under Russian control, giving Russia the land bridge from Crimea across the southern coast of Ukraine it had sought since February. Narrower Ambitions Since mid-May, the Russians have narrowed their focus to the Donbas and started using smaller units to gradually capture towns and villages in the region. A senior defense official said the Russian military's losses were not insignificant and highlighted that Russia had lost nearly 1,000 tanks, 350 artillery pieces, and almost three dozen fighter aircraft. Despite these losses, the official cautioned that the Russian military has a numerical superiority over Ukraine in terms of equipment and manpower it can commit to the fight. On the Ukrainian side, Zelenskyy told Newsmax in an interview this week that the Ukrainian forces are losing up to 100 soldiers a day in eastern Ukraine and called the situation difficult. In an effort to help the Ukrainians, the U.S. and other allies are stepping up their assistance. On June 1, the Biden administration announced it would provide high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) to Ukraine with munitions that have a range of up to 70 kilometers. The HIMARS is the most significant piece of equipment the U.S. has provided Ukraine with so far. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Dr. Colin H. Kahl on Wednesday said the type of weapons the U.S. has provided to Ukraine has shifted over time as the fight has shifted to an artillery duel in the east. Initially, the priority was javelins and anti-tank weapons, then it was M777 Howitzers that have a range of about 30 kilometers, and now the U.S. is shifting to providing HIMARS. The initial tranche includes four HIMARS systems, but it will take some time for the HIMARS to arrive in Ukraine since training Ukrainians on them will take about three weeks, Kahl said. The Russians have made recent gains and are close to capturing the city of Severodonetsk, the last remaining significant city in the Luhansk oblast — or region. The fall of Severodonetsk would put Russia closer to achieving control of the Donbas, which includes the oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk. In 2014, Russian-backed separatists in these regions tried to break away from Ukraine, and Putin claimed the invasion in February was to protect these regions. One hundred days later, Russia is slowly making progress, but it remains to be seen how much longer the fighting will carry on and what victory looks like for either side.",7,4.410228766381217,4.731689633089786,-0.321460866708569,19
2022-06-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-us-germany-advanced-weapons/,U.S. and Germany announce weapons packages for Ukraine,"The U.S. and Germany pledged on Wednesday to equip Ukraine with some of the advanced weapons it has long desired for shooting down aircraft and knocking out artillery, as Russian forces closed in on capturing a key city in the east. Germany said it will supply Ukraine with up-to-date anti-aircraft missiles and radar systems, while the U.S. announced it will provide four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition. The U.S. is trying to help Ukraine fend off the Russians without triggering a wider war in Europe. The Pentagon said it received assurances that Ukraine will not fire the new rockets into Russian territory. The Kremlin accused the U.S. of ""pouring fuel on the fire."" Western arms have been critical to Ukraine's success in stymieing Russia's much larger and better-equipped military, thwarting its effort to storm the capital and forcing Moscow to shift its focus to the industrial Donbas region in the east. But as Russia bombards towns in its inching advance in the east, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly pleaded for more and better weapons and accused the West of moving too slowly. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, hailed the new Western weapons. ""I'm sure that if we receive all the necessary weapons and strengthen the efficient sanctions regime we will win,"" he said. The new arms could help Ukraine set up and hold new lines of defense in the east by hitting back at Russian artillery pieces that have been battering towns and cities and by limiting Russian airstrikes, said retired French Gen. Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France's military mission at the United Nations. ""The NATO countries — the European nations and the Americans — have progressively escalated the means that they are putting at Ukraine's disposal, and this escalation, in my opinion, has had the aim of testing Russian limits,"" he said. ""Each time, they measure the Russian reaction, and since there is no reaction, they keep supplying increasingly effective and sophisticated weaponry."" Military analysts say Russia is hoping to overrun the Donbas before any weapons that might turn the tide arrive. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision U.S. weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said. But Defense Undersecretary Colin Kahl said he believes they will arrive in time to make a difference in the fight. The rocket systems are part of a new $700 million package of security assistance for Ukraine from the U.S. that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. The rockets have a range of about 50 miles (80 kilometers) and are highly mobile. Ukraine had pushed unsuccessfully for rockets with a range of up to 186 miles (300 kilometers). Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow does not trust assurances that Ukraine will not fire on Russian territory. ""We believe that the U.S. is deliberately and diligently pouring fuel on the fire,"" he said. Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintzev later went further, directly accusing Ukraine of planning to fire U.S.-provided missiles from the northeastern Sumy region at border areas in Russia. The claim, which he said was based on radio intercepts, couldn't be independently confirmed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ukraine's push for more weapons is a ""direct provocation intended to draw the West into the fighting."" He warned that the multiple rocket launchers would raise the risk of an expanded conflict. ""Sane Western politicians understand those risks well,"" he said. As the new weapons shipments were announced, a Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of Western weapons and other supplies, officials said. Regional Gov. Maksym Kozytskyy said five people were wounded in Wednesday's strike, and the head of Ukrainian railways said the damage was still being assessed. Germany's promise of IRIS-T air defense systems would mark the first delivery of long-range air defense weapons to Ukraine since the start of the war. Earlier deliveries of portable, shoulder-fired air defense missiles have bolstered the Ukrainian military's ability to take down helicopters and other low-flying aircraft but didn't give it enough range to challenge Russia's air superiority. Germany has come under particular criticism, both at home and from allies abroad, that it isn't doing enough. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told lawmakers that the IRIS-T's surface-to-air missiles are the most modern air defense system the country has. ""With this, we will enable Ukraine to defend an entire city from Russian air attacks,"" he said. The radar systems will also help Ukraine locate enemy artillery. A regional governor said Russian forces now control 80% of Sievierodonetsk, a city that is key to Moscow's efforts to complete its capture of the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists have fought for years and where the separatists held swaths of territory even before the invasion. Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Russian troops were advancing in the city during fierce street battles with Ukrainian forces, though he noted that in some districts the Ukrainian troops managed to push them back. The only other city in Luhansk that the Russians have not yet captured, Lysychansk, is still fully under Ukrainian control, he said, but is likely to be the next target. The two cities are separated by a river. ""If the Russians manage to take full control over Sievierodonetsk within two to three days, they will start installing artillery and mortars and will shell Lysychansk more intensively,"" Haidai said. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said the country is losing between 60 and 100 soldiers a day in the fighting. He turned the focus to children in his nightly video address, saying 243 of them have been killed in the war, 446 have been wounded and 139 are missing. The real numbers could be higher, he added, as his government doesn't have a full picture of areas under Russian occupation. Zelenskyy also said 200,000 children are among the Ukrainians who have been forcefully taken to Russia and dispersed across that vast country: ""The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return."" In southern Ukraine, a regional governor sounded a more positive note, saying Russian troops were retreating and blowing up bridges behind them. ""They are afraid of a counterattack by the Ukrainian army,"" Vitaliy Kim, governor of the Mykolayiv region, said on the Telegram messaging app.",49,1.7276978358668083,3.973540228611392,-2.2458423927445836,19
2022-06-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/boston-childrens-hospital-cyberattack-fbi-iran/,"'Despicable' cyberattack attempt on Boston Children's Hospital thwarted, FBI director says","BOSTON - The FBI last year thwarted a planned cyberattack on Boston Children's Hospital that was to have been carried out by hackers sponsored by the Iranian government, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday. ""In the summer of 2021, hackers sponsored by the Iranian government tried to conduct one of the most despicable cyberattacks I've ever seen, right here in Boston, when they decided to go after Boston Children's Hospital,"" Wray said in a speech at a Boston College cybersecurity conference. Wray said a report from an intelligence partner indicated that Children's was about to be targeted, and the hospital was immediately notified. ""Quick actions by everyone involved, especially at the hospital, protected both the network and the sick kids who depended on it,"" he said. FBI Boston special agent in charge Joseph Bonavolonta said attack could've hurt the ""continuity of operations"" at the world-renowned pediatric medical facility. ""It was truly a reprehensible attempt at an attack, when you look at what could have occurred if those systems were shut down,"" he said. A hospital spokesperson told WBZ-TV on Wednesday that ""Thanks to the FBI and our Boston Children's Hospital staff working so closely together, we proactively thwarted the threat to our network."" Wray said the bureau and Boston Children's Hospital had worked closely together after a hacktivist attacked the hospital's computer network in 2014. Martin Gottesfeld launched a cyberattack at the hospital to protest the care of a teenager at the center of a high-profile custody battle and later was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The attack against the hospital and a treatment home cost the facilities tens of thousands of dollars and disrupted operations for days. ""Children's and our Boston office already knew each other well — before the attack from Iran — and that made a difference,"" Wray said. He did not ascribe a particular motive to the planned attack on the hospital, but he noted that Iran and other countries have been hiring cyber mercenaries to conduct attacks on their behalf. When it comes to Russia, he said, the FBI is ""racing"" to warn potential targets about preparatory actions that hackers are taking toward destructive attacks. In March, for instance, the FBI warned that it was seeing increased interest by hackers in energy companies since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine. Hackers from China, meanwhile, have stolen more corporate and personal data from Americans than all other nations combined as part of a broader geopolitical goal to ""lie, cheat and steal,"" Wray said. The speech took place as the FBI continues to combat ransomware attacks from criminal gangs, an ongoing concern for U.S. officials despite the absence of crippling intrusions in recent months. Wray emphasized the need for private companies to work with the FBI to thwart ransomware gangs and nation-state hackers, adding that building those relationships is a key to success. ""What these partnerships let us do is hit our adversaries at every point — from the victims' networks, back all the way to the hackers' own computers,"" Wray said. The FBI and other federal agencies have been working to assure hacking victims that it is in their best interest to report intrusions and cyber crimes. Many companies attacked by ransomware gangs often don't go to the FBI for a variety of reasons. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio and the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, issued a report earlier this year critical of the FBI's response to some ransomware victims. In two cases, the FBI ""prioritized its investigative and prosecutorial efforts to disrupt attacker operations over victims' need to protect data and mitigate damage,"" the report said. One unnamed Fortune 500 company told committee staff that the FBI did not offer any ""helpful assistance"" when responding to a ransomware attack. ""For example, the FBI offered their hostage negotiator who appeared to have little expertise in responding to ransomware attacks,"" the report said. Wray, though, touted the FBI's capacity to get a technically trained agent to any victimized company in an hour — ""and we use it a lot.""",20,8.062193524551112,6.425080331903173,1.6371131926479396,16
2022-06-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-aid-package-himars-rockets/,"Biden administration officials outline new $700 million Ukraine security package, including longer range rocket systems","The Biden administration on Tuesday announced details of the newest $700 million security package it is sending to Ukraine, which includes rocket systems with longer ranges than those sent in previous packages. The package is expected to be officially announced Wednesday. The High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) will provide Ukrainian troops with greater precision when striking against Russian advances, senior administration officials told reporters Tuesday night. The officials stressed that these newer systems will not be used to strike at targets within Russia. Officials also said they will not be giving Ukraine long-range weapons, and added that Ukraine has assured the U.S. that it will not fire the medium-range rockets into Russian territory. The aid package also includes radar systems, more Javelin missiles, anti-armor weapons, helicopters, tactical vehicles, and various forms of ammunition. The U.S. decision to provide the advance rocket systems tries to strike a balance between the desire to help Ukraine battle ferocious Russian artillery barrages while not providing arms that could allow Ukraine to hit targets deep inside Russia and trigger an escalation in the war. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow views the latest package of U.S. military aid to Ukraine ""extremely negatively,"" adding that it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation, according to the Reuters news agency. He pointed to the HIMARS equipment in particular, Reuters said. In a guest essay published Tuesday evening in The New York Times, President Biden confirmed that he's decided to ""provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine."" Mr. Biden had said Monday that the U.S. would not send Ukraine ""rocket systems that can strike into Russia."" Any weapons system can shoot into Russia if it's close enough to the border. The aid package expected to be unveiled Wednesday would send what the U.S. considers medium-range rockets — they generally can travel about 45 miles (70 kilometers), the officials said. The expectation is that Ukraine could use the rockets in the eastern Donbas region, where they could both intercept Russian artillery and take out Russian positions in towns where fighting is intense, such as Sievierodonetsk. Sievierodonetsk is important to Russian efforts to capture the Donbas before more Western arms arrive to bolster Ukraine's defense. The city, which is 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of the Russian border, is in an area that is the last pocket under Ukrainian government control in the Luhansk region of the Donbas. Mr. Biden in his New York Times essay added: ""We are not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia."" It's the 11th package approved so far, and will be the first to tap the $40 billion in security and economic assistance recently passed by Congress. The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so would involve taking weapons from U.S. inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would also need training on the new systems, which could take at least a week or two. Officials said the plan is to send Ukraine the HIMARS, which is mounted on a truck and can carry a container with six rockets. The system can launch a medium-range rocket, which is the current plan, but is also capable of firing a longer-range missile, the Army Tactical Missile System, which has a range of about 190 miles (300 kilometers) and is not part of the plan. Since the war began in February, the U.S. and its allies have tried to walk a narrow line: send Ukraine weapons needed to fight off Russia, but stop short of providing aid that will inflame Russian President Vladimir Putin and trigger a broader conflict that could spill over into other parts of Europe. Over time, however, the U.S. and allies have amped up the weaponry going into Ukraine, as the fight has shifted from Russia's broader campaign to take the capital, Kyiv, and other areas, to more close-contact skirmishes for small pieces of land in the east and south. To that end, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pleading with the West to send multiple launch rocket systems to Ukraine as soon as possible to help stop Russia's destruction of towns in the Donbas. The rockets have a longer range than the howitzer artillery systems that the U.S. has provided Ukraine. They would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian troops from a distance outside the range of Russia's artillery systems. ""We are fighting for Ukraine to be provided with all the weapons needed to change the nature of the fighting and start moving faster and more confidently toward the expulsion of the occupiers,"" Zelenskyy said in a recent address. Ukraine needs multiple launch rocket systems, said Philip Breedlove, a retired U.S. Air Force general who was NATO's top commander from 2013 to 2016. ""These are very important capabilities that we have not gotten them yet. And they not only need them, but they have been very vociferous in explaining they want them,"" said Breedlove. ""We need to get serious about supplying this army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield."" U.S. and White House officials had no public comment on the specifics of the aid package. ""We continue to consider a range of systems that have the potential to be effective on the battlefield for our Ukrainian partners. But the point the president made is that we won't be sending long-range rockets for use beyond the battlefield in Ukraine,"" State Department Ned Price said Tuesday. ""As the battle has shifted its dynamics, we have also shifted the type of security assistance that we are providing to them, in large part because they have asked us for the various systems that are going to be more effective in places like the Donbas."" Russia has been making incremental progress in the Donbas, as it tries to take the remaining sections of the region not already controlled by Russian-backed separatists. Putin has repeatedly warned the West against sending greater firepower to Ukraine. The Kremlin said Putin held an 80-minute telephone call Saturday with the leaders of France and Germany in which he warned against the continued transfers of Western weapons. Overall, the United States has committed approximately $5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration, including approximately $4.5 billion since the Russia invaded on Feb. 24.",49,4.739252990156586,6.151968136240549,-1.412715146083963,5

The bodies were decomposing and the stench hung over the neighborhood, said Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor. He did not say when they were discovered, but the sheer number of victims makes it one of the deadliest known attacks of the war. Meanwhile, heavy fighting continued in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that Moscow's forces are intent on seizing. Russian troops intensified their efforts to encircle and capture Sievierodonetsk and neighboring cities. Mariupol was relentlessly pounded during a nearly three-month siege that ended last week after some 2,500 Ukrainian fighters abandoned a steel plant where they had made their stand. Russian forces already held the rest of the city, where an estimated 100,000 people remain out of a prewar population of 450,000, many of them trapped during the siege with little food, water, heat or electricity. At least 21,000 people were killed in the siege, according to Ukrainian authorities, who have accused Russia of trying to cover up the horrors by bringing in mobile cremation equipment and by burying the dead in mass graves. During the assault on Mariupol, Russian airstrikes hit a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians were taking shelter. An Associated Press investigation found that close to 600 people died in the theater attack, double the figure estimated by Ukrainian authorities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the Russians of waging ""total war"" and seeking to inflict as much death and destruction as possible on his country. ""Indeed, there has not been such a war on the European continent for 77 years,"" Zelensky said, referring to the end of World War II. Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for eight years and hold large swaths of territory. Sievierodonetsk and neighboring cities are the only part of the Donbas' Luhansk region still under Ukrainian government control. Russian forces have achieved ""some localized successes"" despite strong Ukrainian resistance along dug-in positions, British military authorities said. Moscow's troops also took over the town of Svitlodarsk and raised the Russian flag there, Ukrainian media reported. Svitlodarsk is about 31 miles southeast of the strategically important city of Kramatorsk. Two top Russian officials appeared to acknowledge that Moscow's advance has been slower than expected, though they vowed the offensive would achieve its goals. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council. said the Russian government ""is not chasing deadlines."" And Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of a Russia-led security alliance of former Soviet states that Moscow is deliberately slowing down its offensive to allow residents of encircled cities to evacuate — though forces have repeatedly hit civilian targets. As Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, recovers from weeks of relentless bombardment, residents formed long lines to receive rations of flour, pasta, sugar and other staples this week. Moscow's forces withdrew from around Kharkiv earlier this month, pulling back toward the Russian border. Galina Kolembed, the aid distribution center coordinator, said that more and more people are returning to the city. Kolembed said the center is providing food to over 1,000 people every day, a number that keeps growing. ""Many of them have small kids, and they spend their money on the kids, so they need some support with food,"" she said.",47,4.840610565696731,4.6869802001172465,0.15363036557948462,19

A court in Kyiv handed a Russian soldier the sentence for the shooting of an unarmed civilian in the early days of the war. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was convicted Monday of shooting and killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov on February 28 — just four days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion — in the northeast Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka. Shishimarin pleaded guilty, but said he had been acting on orders, and apologized to Shelipov's widow. Russia denies that its military has targeted civilians at all during the invasion, but Ukraine says it is investigating around than 13,000 war crimes already. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would search for ways to defend Shishimarin. ""Of course we are concerned about the fate of our citizen. Unfortunately, we are unable to defend his interests on the ground. This is due to the de facto lack of operations of our institutions [in Ukraine]. But this does not mean we will stop considering ways to continue our efforts through other channels,"" Peskov said Monday. At a previous hearing, prosecutors said Shishimarin had been driving in a private vehicle with other soldiers, which they had stolen in an attempt to escape after their column came under attack by Ukrainian forces. They drove to the village of Chupakhivka, where they came upon Shelipov riding a bicycle and talking on his phone. Prosecutors said Shishimarin was ordered to shoot the civilian to stop him from telling Ukrainian forces about the Russians' location. They said Shishimarin fired several shots out of his open car window at the victim's head, killing him instantly. Shishimarin's defense lawyer said he had fired only after refusing the order to shoot Shelipov two times, and that he had done so out of fear for his own safety. Kateryna Shelipova, Oleksandr Shelipov's widow, confronted Shishimarin during the trial, CBS partner network BBC News reported. ""Tell me please, why did you [Russians] come here? To 'protect' us?"" she said, mocking Putin's own justification for the war. ""Protect us from whom? Did you protect me from my husband, whom you killed?"" Later she told the BBC: ""I feel very sorry for him, but for a crime like that, I can't forgive him.""",45,4.956210659824178,1.4516119375293457,3.5045987222948325,25

The soldier, Vadim Shishimarin, had pleaded guilty to shooting a 62-year-old civilian to death on the fourth day of the conflict in late February. Before delivering the verdict on Monday, the court said that Shishimarin had ""committed a criminal offense"" according to international humanitarian law. ""[Shishimarin] saw a civilian on the pavement, Oleksandr Shelipov,"" the court said. ""Shishimarin knowing that Shelipov is a civilian and is unarmed and does not pose any threat to him -- fired several shots at Shelipov from his AK-gun."" ""The cause of Shelipov's death was a shot in the head that resulted in crushing of the skull,"" the court added. The sentence may be appealed within 30 days. Prosecutor Andriy Sunyuk raised the possibility of more war crimes trials against Russian troops, and said he hoped Shishimarin's conviction could send a message. ""I think that all other law enforcement agencies will move along the path that we have traveled,"" he said. ""This will be a good example for other occupiers who may not yet be on our territory but are planning to come,"" added Sunyuk. ""Or for those who are here now and plan to stay and fight. Or maybe they will think that it's time to leave here for their own territory."" Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin is ""concerned"" about Shishimarin and will seek ways of assisting him. ""Of course, we are concerned about the fate of our citizen,"" Peskov told reporters on a regular conference call. ""We do not have many opportunities to protect his interests on the ground, as foreign institutions actually have no activity [in Kyiv]. But this does not mean that we will not consider the possibility of making attempts through other channels,"" Peskov added, without clarifying which channels he was speaking about. Peskov previously said Russia considers the charges ""unacceptable,"" ""outrageous"" and ""staged."" Speaking Friday, Shishimarin acknowledged he was responsible for the killing but was ""sorry and sincerely repents."" ""I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn't want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,"" he said. Shishimarin's lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, argued that while his client was guilty of killing, it was not murder. ""Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,"" Ovsyannikov said. Ovsyannikov attempted to paint his client and other Russian troops as unwitting pawns in the Kremlin's Machiavellian scheme. The soldiers, Ovsyannikov said, were not aware that their actions would ""result in mass deaths not only of servicemen, but civilians too."" Shishimarin, who appeared in court behind glass wearing a blue-gray top with a shaved head, only spoke on several occasions during the proceedings. He said he was ""fully guilty"" when he entered a plea on Wednesday and, on Thursday he was forced to confront his victim's widow. Shishimarin told her: ""I understand that you will not be able to forgive me, but I am sorry."" The woman questioned the Russian soldier as to why he came to Ukraine, asking rhetorically: ""Did you come to defend us? From whom? Did you defend me from my husband you killed?"" ""We were ordered to come with the column, what will follow I did not know,"" Shishimarin said. window.addEventListener('load', function() { (function(c, id, p, d, w){ var i = d.createElement('iframe'); i.height = '0'; i.width = '0'; i.style = { display: 'none', position: 'absolute', visibility: 'hidden' }; i.src = "" + encodeURI(w.location); d.body.appendChild(i); })(""Europe%2FMideast%2FAfrica"", ""h_10fc8c0f92e6242fce2841ee3a977d45"", ""216"", document, window)}) The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

2022-05-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-claims-mariupol-wives-ukraine-fighters-last-messages/,"Russia claims to have full control of Mariupol as wives share last messages from Ukraine fighters: ""Love you. Kiss you. Bye.""","Russia claimed to have captured Mariupol on Friday in what would be its biggest victory yet in its war in Ukraine. The announcement came following a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin, with over 20,000 civilians feared dead. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the ""complete liberation"" of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol - the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance - and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying that a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at Azovstal had laid down their arms and surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday. The steelworks had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out in the plant, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire before their government ordered them to abandon its defense and save their lives. Wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands. Olga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: ""Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye."" Natalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, ""Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly."" She said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded. The complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed military victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 - a conflict that was supposed to have been a quick and easy victory for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of its forces to refocus on battles in eastern Ukraine and even the sinking of Russia's flagship of its Black Sea fleet, the Moskva. Military analysts say the city's capture at this point holds more symbolic importance than anything else, since Mariupol is already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the drawn-out fighting have already left. Russia had sought control of Mariupol, on the coast of the Sea of Azov, to complete a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the growing battle for control of the wider industrial Donbas region, home to an 8-year-old Moscow-backed separatist rebellion. It would also deprive Ukraine of a vital port. The city endured some of the worst suffering of the war. An estimated 100,000 people remained from a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Constant bombardment has left behind shattered and charred buildings in row after row of destroyed apartment blocks and ruined neighborhoods. A maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the facility. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600. Officials had written the word ""CHILDREN"" in Russian on the pavement outside to try to forestall an aerial attack. Long traffic jams of cars snaked out of the city, filled with evacuees fleeing past checkpoints of Russian soldiers with heavy weapons who didn't have time to search inside each vehicle in the convoys. Satellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves near Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians. The imagery showed rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery in the town of Manhush, outside the port city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of ""hiding their military crimes"" in the mass graves and labeled it ""the new Babi Yar"" -- recalling the ravine in Kyiv where the Nazis massacred nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews during World War II. It was not the first time Moscow has claimed to have captured Mariupol. At a joint appearance with his defense minister on April 21, Putin declared that ""the completion of combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success."" Even though die-hard Ukrainian forces were still inside the Azovstal plant at that point, Putin ordered the military to seal off the complex ""so that not even a fly comes through."" After continued bombardment, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on May 16 the evacuation of his forces from the bunkers and tunnels beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters. ""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,"" Zelenskyy said. The Azovstal complex covers 11 square kilometers (4 square miles) and is threaded with about 24 kilometers (15 miles) of tunnels and bunkers. Earlier in May, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires. One civilian evacuee from Azovstal, who made it to the Ukrainian controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on May 3, said she went to sleep at the plant every night afraid she wouldn't wake up. ""You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the bomb shelter, in a damp and wet basement, and it is bouncing and shaking,"" said Elina Tsybulchenko, 54. While Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a fulfilled mission. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as ""the Thermopylae of the 21st century"" - a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. ""The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war,"" Podolyak said. Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Mariupol's defenders gave Ukraine ""critically important time to form reserves and regroup forces and receive help from partners. And they fulfilled all their tasks."" The U.S. has gathered intelligence that shows some Russian officials have become concerned that Russian forces in the ravaged port city of Mariupol are carrying out grievous abuses, a U.S official familiar with the newly declassified findings told CBS News. The Russian officials are concerned that the abuses will backfire and further inspire Mariupol residents to resist the Russian occupation.

The Russian officials are concerned that the abuses will backfire and further inspire Mariupol residents to resist the Russian occupation. The U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Russians, who were not identified, also feared that the abuses will undercut Russia's claim that they've liberated the Russian-speaking city. The abuses include beating and electrocuting city officials and robbing homes, according to the intelligence finding. The new intelligence has been declassified and was shared by a U.S. official as some of the last Ukrainian fighters in the devastated city emerged from the ruined Azovstal steelworks. The fighters were ordered by their military to abandon the last stronghold of resistance in the now-flattened port city and face an uncertain fate. Hundreds of the fighters had held out for months under relentless bombardment in the last bastion of resistance in the devastated city. The city has been reduced to rubble and has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war. The seaside city captured worldwide attention after a March 9 Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital, and then after another airstrike a week later on a theater that was serving as the city's largest bomb shelter. At the theater, the word ""CHILDREN"" was written in Russian on the pavement outside to deter an attack. Nearly 600 people were killed, inside and outside the theater, by some estimates. It was unclear the extent of the suspected abuse gleaned in the U.S. intelligence finding, but it comes on the heels of widespread human rights abuses in and around Bucha and the suburbs of Kyiv. Evidence of the massacre in Bucha emerged early last month after Russian forces withdrew from the city. Photographs and video from Bucha showed body bags piled in trenches, lifeless limbs protruding from hastily dug graves, and corpses scattered in streets where they fell. Meanwhile, the first captured Russian soldier to be put on trial by Ukraine on war-crimes charges pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing a civilian and could face life in prison. Russian Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old member of a tank unit, pleaded guilty to shooting an unarmed 62-year-old Ukrainian man in the head through a car window in the opening days of the war.

Called the ""Conflict Observatory,"" the new program will maintain ""rigorous chain-of-custody procedures for future civil and criminal legal processes under appropriate jurisdictions,"" the State Department said. The announcement came as the International Criminal Court deployed its ""largest ever"" team of investigators, forensic experts and support staff to collect evidence and help coordinate activities around war crimes investigations in Ukraine. ""Through the deployment of a team of investigators, we will further expand lead development and collect testimonial accounts relevant to military attacks that may constitute Rome Statute crimes,"" ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said in a statement, referring to the treaty that established the court and outlines its function. He said his team would work with Ukrainian authorities and others on the ground to coordinate efforts and strengthen the chain of custody for evidence. ""It is essential that the work of all actors seeking to support accountability efforts in Ukraine benefit from effective coordination and communication. In doing so, we will significantly strengthen the impact of our collective work in establishing the truth,"" Khan said.

Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin appeared in court and pleaded guilty to shooting a 62-year-old man on a bicycle four days after the start of the war, in a town about 200 miles east of Kyiv. Asked if he was guilty of charges including war crimes and premeditated murder, the 21-year-old sergeant responded: ""Yes"". Human Rights Watch released a report, meanwhile, outlining purported evidence of summary executions and torture by Russian troops in occupied areas around Kyiv and Chernihiv during the early days of the invasion. ""The numerous atrocities by Russian forces occupying parts of northeastern Ukraine early in the war are abhorrent, unlawful, and cruel,"" Giorgi Gogia, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""These abuses against civilians are evident war crimes that should be promptly and impartially investigated and appropriately prosecuted."" In early April, CBS News correspondent Debora Patta and her team visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha to see for themselves the evidence of killings there that Russia has dismissed as ""fake."" The ICC announced its investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine four days after Russia's invasion of the country in February. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is a state party to the Rome Statute, and Russia does not recognise the court. However, Ukraine accepted the jurisdiction of the court for crimes committed in its territory starting in 2014. Khan, the ICC prosecutor, visited Ukraine in April, where he witnessed the aftermath of atrocities carried out in Bucha and called the entire country ""a crime scene.""

Shishimarin appeared Wednesday at a district court in Kyiv.

Ukrainian officials said the fighters had ""completed their mission"" and there was no way the country's forces could free the plant from Russia's grasp by military means. Russia called it a surrender, and there was no doubt that Moscow and its proxy forces in Ukraine were in full control of the strategic southern port city — even if much of it has been razed to the ground. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports the fighters held out for 82 days under brutal conditions in the steelworks, becoming a collective symbol of Ukraine's resistance and Russia's merciless tactics in the war. But overnight, dozens of buses were seen leaving the plant carrying the bedraggled forces away, many in urgent need of medical care. They were taken under escort by pro-Russian forces to territory held by those rebels, with Ukraine hoping for a prisoner exchange while rescue attempts continued for those still underground. The Ukrainian military avoided using the term ""surrender"" to describe the effort to pull out of the steel plant, but Russia declared it just that. ""Over the past 24 hours, 265 militants laid down their arms and surrendered, including 51 heavily wounded,"" the Russian Ministry of Defense announced in a briefing on Tuesday, saying those in need of medical care were transferred to a hospital in the pro-Russian rebel-held town of Novoazovsk. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the evacuation to separatist-controlled territory was done to save the lives of the fighters who endured weeks of Russian assaults in the maze of underground passages below the hulking Azovstal steelworks. ""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,"" he said. An unknown number of fighters stayed behind, but reports by local media outlets suggested more were preparing to accept evacuation into pro-Russian territory. ""The work to bring the guys home continues, and it requires delicacy and time,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Thanks to the defenders of Mariupol, Ukraine gained critically important time to form reserves and regroup forces and receive help from partners,"" Deputy Ukrainian Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said. ""They fulfilled all their tasks. But it is impossible to unblock Azovstal by military means."" The steel mill's defenders got out as Moscow suffered another diplomatic setback in its war with Ukraine, with Sweden and Finland deciding to seek NATO membership. And Ukraine made a symbolic gain as its forces reportedly pushed Russian troops back to the Russian border in the Kharkiv region. Still, Russian forces pounded targets in the industrial heartland of eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas, and the death toll, already many thousands, kept climbing with the war set to enter its 12th week on Wednesday. The eastern city of Sievierdonetsk in Donbas came under heavy shelling that killed at least 10 people, said Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region. In the Donetsk region, Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Facebook that nine civilians were killed in shelling. The western Ukrainian city of Lviv was rocked by loud explosions early Tuesday. Witnesses counted at least eight blasts accompanied by distant booms, and the smell of burning was apparent some time later. An Associated Press team in Lviv, which was under an overnight curfew, said the sky west of the city was lit up by an orange glow. But Ukrainian troops also advanced as Russian forces pulled back from around the northeastern city of Kharkiv in recent days. Zelenskyy thanked the soldiers who reportedly pushed them all the way to the Russian border in the Kharkiv region. Video showed Ukrainian soldiers carrying a post that resembled a Ukrainian blue-and-yellow-striped border marker. Then they placed it on the ground while a dozen of the soldiers posed next to it, including one with belts of bullets draped over a shoulder. ""I'm very grateful to you, on behalf of all Ukrainians, on my behalf and on behalf of my family,"" Zelenskyy said in a video message. ""I'm very grateful to all the fighters like you."" The Ukrainian border service said the video showing the soldiers was from the border ""in the Kharkiv region,"" but would not elaborate, citing security reasons. It was not immediately possible to verify the exact location. CBS News' Patta and her team visited the town of Derhachi on Tuesday, which is about as close as the Russian ground forces got to Kharkiv — less than a mile away from Ukraine's second city. Despite their retreat, they can still inflict terrible damage. Mayor Vyacheslav Zadorenko told CBS News that a cultural center used as a distribution hub for humanitarian aid was hit twice in the past week alone. The situation remains critical in four nearby villages still under Russian control. ""They are 'liberating us from the Nazis,'' the mayor told Patta, mocking Vladimir Putin's excuse for the war in Ukraine, ""but in reality, they are 'liberating' us from the peaceful life we used to have."" That peace was still very much under threat on Tuesday. Patta and her team heard shelling throughout the morning. Proof that while Russia's forces may have been pushed back, it clearly wasn't far enough. Russia has been plagued by setbacks in the war, most glaringly in its failure early on to take the capital of Kyiv. Much of the fighting has shifted to the Donbas but also has turned into a slog, with both sides fighting village-by-village. Away from the battlefield, Sweden's decision to seek NATO membership followed a similar decision by neighboring Finland in a historic shift for the counties, which were non-aligned for generations. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said her country would be in a ""vulnerable position"" during the application period and urged her fellow citizens to brace themselves. ""Russia has said that it will take countermeasures if we join NATO,"" she said. ""We cannot rule out that Sweden will be exposed to, for instance, disinformation and attempts to intimidate and divide us."" But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a NATO member, ratcheted up his objection to their joining. He accused the countries of failing to take a ""clear"" stance against Kurdish militants and other groups that Ankara considers terrorists, and of imposing military sanctions on Turkey. He said Swedish and Finnish officials who are expected in Turkey next week should not bother to come if they intend to try to convince Turkey of dropping its objection. ""How can we trust them?"" Erdogan asked at a joint news conference with the visiting Algerian president. All 30 current NATO members must agree to let the Nordic neighbors join. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow ""does not have a problem"" with Sweden or Finland as they apply for NATO membership, but that ""the expansion of military infrastructure onto this territory will of course give rise to our reaction in response."" Putin launched the invasion on Feb. 24 in what he said was an effort to check NATO's expansion but has seen that strategy backfire. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said the membership process for both could be quick. Europe is also working to choke off funding for the Kremlin's war by reducing the billions of dollars it spends on imports of Russian energy. A proposed EU embargo faces opposition from some countries dependent on Russian imports, including Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Bulgaria also has reservations.",47,5.486039599570006,5.31298213976475,0.1730574598052561,19
2022-05-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/key-lawmaker-warns-at-ufo-hearing-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-are-a-potential-national-security-threat/,Key Lawmaker Warns At UFO Hearing: 'Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Are A Potential National Security Threat',"(CNN) -- A House panel is holding a public hearing on Tuesday on ""unidentified aerial phenomena,"" popularly known as UFOs, a high-profile moment for a controversial topic that has long been relegated to the fringes of public policy. The hearing, which is being livestreamed, has been convened by the House Intelligence Committee's Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation subcommittee, a panel chaired by Democratic Rep. André Carson of Indiana. Carson warned in his opening remarks at the hearing, ""This hearing and our oversight work has a simple idea at its core: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena are a potential national security threat. And they need to be treated that way."" He went on to say, ""For too long, the stigma associated with UAPs has gotten in the way of good intelligence analysis. Pilots avoided reporting, or were laughed at when they did. DOD officials relegated the issue to the back room, or swept it under the rug entirely, fearful of a skeptical national security community."" ""Today, we know better. UAPs are unexplained, it's true. But they are real. They need to be investigated. And any threats they pose need to be mitigated,"" he said. As part of the proceedings, Ronald Moultrie, under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, and Scott Bray, deputy director of naval intelligence, are appearing before the subcommittee. After the public hearing concludes, the panel will also be holding a closed-door, classified briefing. The event is the first congressional public hearing on UFOs in decades. It follows the release last year by the US intelligence community of a long-awaited report on mysterious flying objects that have been seen moving through restricted military airspace over the last several decades. The report examined 144 reports of what the government terms ""unidentified aerial phenomenon"" -- only one of which investigators were able to explain by the end of the study. Investigators found no evidence that the sightings represented either extraterrestrial life or a major technological advancement by a foreign adversary like Russia or China, but acknowledge that is a possible explanation. For lawmakers and intelligence and military personnel working on unexplained aerial phenomena, the bigger concern with the episodes is not that alien life is visiting Earth, but rather that a foreign adversary like Russia or China might be fielding some kind of next-generation technology in American airspace that the United States doesn't know about. In November 2021, the Department of Defense announced the creation of the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group. The department said in a release at the time that the purpose of the new program would be to sync up efforts across the US government to ""detect, identify and attribute objects of interest"" in restricted airspace ""to assess and mitigate any associated threats to safety of flight and national security."" In a statement ahead of the hearing, Carson said, ""The American people expect and deserve their leaders in government and intelligence to seriously evaluate and respond to any potential national security risks -- especially those we do not fully understand."" The subcommittee chairman went on to say, ""since coming to Congress, I've been focused on the issue of unidentified aerial phenomena as both a national security threat and an interest of great importance to the American public. And I'm pleased to chair the first open Intelligence Committee hearing on these events. It will give the American people an opportunity to learn what there is to know about incidents. And I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on this critical matter."" This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

2022-05-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bellingcat-tiktok-ukraine-60-minutes-2022-05-15/,How Bellingcat is using TikTok to investigate the war in Ukraine - 60 Minutes,"Staff at the international collective Bellingcat is investigating allegations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine by using publicly available material on the internet — including photos and videos posted on social media. ""We are discovering the enormity of war for the first time in our lifetime in a way that is near us and a way that we can see it in social media, and Instagram, and TikTok videos,"" said Christo Grozev, Bellingcat's executive director. ""And the volume of war crimes that we believe we are discovering in our daily work is overwhelming."" Grozev told 60 Minutes more open-source information exists from the war in Ukraine than in any other previous war. In previous conflicts, such as the civil war in Syria, static photographs were more common and available than videos. New social media platforms, primarily TikTok, have changed that. Grozev estimates that about 70% of the evidence Bellingcat is gathering about the war in Ukraine now comes from TikTok content. According to Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, information from the video sharing platform began amassing prior to Russia's February invasion, when civilians posted TikTok videos of tanks driving down Russian streets. These videos not only showed the buildup before the invasion, Higgins said, but they also identified the specific units and equipment the Russian military planned to use. In instances where Bellingcat suspects Russians deployed cluster munitions into Ukraine from rocket launchers fired from inside Russia, Bellingcat says they can identify the units likely responsible. ""In some cases, it's actually possible to see these convoys through their entire journey from their base all the way to the border,"" Higgins said. ""So all these bits of information give us additional evidence that we can use for accountability purposes in the future."" To preserve the evidence of possible war crimes, the U.S. House Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees on Thursday sent letters to social media companies to urge them to archive the content on their platforms. Chairs of the two committees wrote to the CEOs of Meta, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok and asked that they preserve content, including metadata, that could potentially be used in international court to prove war crimes and human rights violations in Ukraine. Bellingcat has also used open-source evidence to dispel Russia's claim that potential war crimes committed in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha were perpetrated after Ukrainian forces had reentered the town. In one example, researchers at Bellingcat verified aerial video filmed by Ukraine's military reportedly on March 3, when Russian forces held Bucha. The video shows a woman walking a bicycle onto a street where a Russian armored vehicle sits. As the woman rounds the corner, the Russian vehicle fires at the woman. Another aerial video shot in late March by Ukrainian forces and verified by Bellingcat shows a body lying in the road at the location where the woman was shot. The Ukrainian military entered Bucha at the beginning of April. The Kremlin has responded to Bellingcat's investigations in the Ukraine war. In a statement earlier this month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""In general, the information of Bellingcat must be perceived through special filters: sometimes with a sense of humor, and sometimes as a deliberate lie and distortion of reality."" Russia's Prosecutor-General in mid-March blocked Bellingcat's website, preventing those in Russia from accessing the group's investigations, including research about Russia's assassination program. After all the evidence his team has found while looking into the atrocities Russia has allegedly committed, Higgins knows Bellingcat's work invites the potential for danger. ""It does involve risk,"" Higgins said. ""But then defending liberty, human rights, democracy involves taking risks. It's when we stop taking risks and we let the fear take hold that we see democracy die."" The video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer. It was edited by Will Croxton.",45,5.885402567795177,3.589731156648086,2.295671411147091,8

The U.N. refugee agency reported the grim statistic, which, combined with the roughly 8 million Ukrainians who have been displaced within their country, means a third of Ukraine's people have been forced from their homes. The war's effect on Ukraine's youth has been particularly devastating, and Britain's U.N. ambassador said that appeared to extend to sexual violence committed against children by the invading forces. British Ambassador Barbara Woodward, citing the U.N. humanitarian agency, said at least 238 children were believed to be among the thousands of civilians killed since Russia launched its war, with 347 more injured. ""There are credible allegations of sexual violence against children by Russian forces,"" Woodward added. ""As others have said, mass displacement has left children exposed to human trafficking and sexual exploitation."" Last month, Ukrainian lawmaker Kira Rudyk told CBS News that sexual violence was being used systematically ""in all the areas that were occupied by the Russians."" ""Rape is used as a tool of war in Ukraine to break our spirits, to humiliate us and to show us that we can be helpless to protect our women and children and their bodies,"" Kira Rudyk, a member of Ukraine's Parliament, told CBS News. ""It is happening systematically in the occupied territories."" At the Security Council on Thursday, U.N. children's agency (UNICEF) Deputy Executive Director Omar said ""children and parents tell us of their 'living hell,' where they were forced to go hungry, drink from muddy puddles, and shelter from constant shelling and bombardments, dodging bombs, bullets and landmines as they fled."" He called the war ""a child protection and child rights crisis."" ""Children in Ukraine have been displaced, hurt, orphaned, or killed,"" U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Richard Mills told diplomats. ""Of the nearly 14 million people forced to flee their homes since the conflict escalated, approximately half are innocent children; children who deserve a chance to live, grow, and thrive, but instead, are struggling every day to survive in horrific circumstances."" Briefing diplomats at the Security Council, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator Joyce Msuya said ""civilians — particularly women and children — are paying the heaviest price"" in the war. Msuya said the situation was deeply worrying in the Luhansk region, in eastern Ukraine's industrial heartland of Donbas, where Russia is currently focusing its assault. She said there were an estimated 40,000 people cut off from electricity, water and gas supplies there alone. The U.N. Human Rights Council met in a special session in Geneva on Thursday, meanwhile, where High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said ""1,000 civilian bodies had been found in the Kyiv region alone... some had been killed in hostilities, but others appeared to have been summarily executed."" ""These killings of civilians often appeared to be intentional, carried out by snipers and soldiers. Civilians were killed when crossing the road or leaving their shelters to seek food and water. Others were killed as they fled in their vehicles,"" Bachelet said. CBS News partner network BBC News documented one such alleged killing on Thursday. The network obtained video from multiple security cameras around a business outside of Kyiv that appear to show several Russian soldiers shooting an unarmed civilian security guard in the back, and then looting the business. One of the soldiers is seen breaking a security camera with the butt of his rifle, apparently upon realizing that he and his colleagues' actions were being recorded.

In some of the latest, Ukrainian officials claim that Vladimir Putin's forces attacked two schools in the country's north, killing three people and wounded 12. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian commanders ""who give such orders"" were ""simply sick and incurable."" Those reports surfaced as the first trial of a Russian soldier accused of a war crime in Ukraine began on Thursday: Russian Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, stands accused of shooting a 62-year-old Ukrainian civilian man in the head in the northeastern village of Chupakhivka in the early days of the war. He faces up to life in prison if convicted. Journalists filed into a small courtroom in Kyiv on Friday as Shishimarin appeared in a glass defendant's cage. Shishimarin is part of a Russian tank unit that was captured by Ukrainian forces after being driven back by Ukrainian troops from north of the capital city just several days after the invasion began on February 24. He has admitted to shooting the man in the incident, which Ukrainian officials say was captured on video by the state Security Service. ""I was ordered to shoot,"" Shishimarin says in a confession video, which appeared to have been edited by Ukrainian authorities. ""I shot one (round) at him. He falls. And we kept on going."" Ukraine's national security service has called Shishimarin's video statement ""one of the first confessions of the enemy invaders."" But while one Russian soldier was being held to account, reports of atrocities continue to mount, and as CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reported on Friday, battles continue to rage across a vast swathe of eastern Ukraine. What Russia has lacked in military strategy so far, it makes up for with brute force, and a seemingly endless supply of deadly artillery. Zelenskyy said Russian shells rained down on two school buildings near the northern city of Chernihiv on Thursday night. ""What's the point of destroying schools?"" he asked in his nightly address to Ukraine's people. ""The Russian state is in such a state that any education only gets in its way."" In the southern port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian soldiers barricaded inside the Azovstal steel plant were astoundingly continuing to hold off Russian troops with every bit of reserve they have left. In the northeast, Ukraine's troops have steadily pushed Russia's forces back from the country's second largest city of Kharkiv. But for Ukraine's civilians, Patta says the 11 weeks of endless misery is taking a devastating toll. In the village of Stepanki, 52-year-old Olga Karpenko's daughter couldn't hide from the Russian tank that fired directly at her house. It hasn't been safe enough to remove her daughter's body from the rubble, leaving Karpenko to relive the trauma every day. ""She didn't die straight away,"" the bereaved mother said. ""She suffered for almost a whole day."" Where the brutality of Russia's war continues in the east, allegations of new atrocities continue to emerge. Where Putin's forces have been turned back, all they leave behind is heartbreak.",47,2.932321478727229,3.976522244038511,-1.044200765311282,25

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in a pair of congressional hearings this week told lawmakers that Russia has been using semiconductors from dishwashers and refrigerators for its military equipment. ""Our approach was to deny Russia technology, technology that would cripple their ability to continue a military operation. And that is exactly what we are doing,"" Raimondi said on Wednesday. She said she has heard anecdotes from the Ukrainian prime minister that some of the Russian equipment left behind contains semiconductors from kitchen appliances because the defense industrial base is having a hard time producing more chips on its own and is facing export controls that limit its ability to import the technology from other countries. Export controls and sanctions have impacted other parts of the weapons industry, according to Raimondi who said two Russian tank manufacturing factories have recently shut down, and many Russian auto manufacturers have furloughed workers. A senior defense official also told reporters earlier this week that sanctions on Russia are starting to affect Russia's ability to replenish its munitions, too. ""We know that — that the sanctions are responsible for — for making it harder for Mr. Putin to replenish those stocks, particularly when it comes to some of the electronic components that go into precision-guided munitions,"" the official said. Precision-guided munitions, according to the Congressional Research Service, use GPS, laser guidance, or inertial navigation systems to hone in on the intended target and minimize the damage to other structures. A low inventory of precision-guided munitions could explain why the Russians are increasingly relying on ""dumb bombs,"" particularly in the city of Mariupol. Deemed ""dumb"" because they are not precision-guided, these bombs are less discriminate. The Russians have also used hypersonic weapons in the war in Ukraine, and one reason to use hypersonics against the type of targets they are is because they're quickly running through their inventory of precision-guided munitions. A senior defense official said this week that the Russians have launched an estimated 10 to 12 hypersonic weapons into Ukraine over the course of the invasion. But Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley in a congressional hearing on Wednesday said the way the Russians are using hypersonics hasn't given them much of a battlefield advantage so far. ""But other than the speed of the weapon in terms of its effect on a given target, we are not seeing really significant or game-changing effects to date with the delivery of the small number of hypersonics that the Russians have used,"" Milley said.

The adviser, Petro Andriushchenko, said there were few apartment buildings left in Mariupol fit to live in after weeks of Russian bombardment, and very little food or drinking water. Andriushchenko said some residents who've remained in the city were cooperating with the Russian occupiers in exchange for food. Ukrainian officials say hundreds of troops remain holed-up in the decimated Azovstal steel plant — the last holdouts against Russia's complete takeover of the strategic city. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta met some of the wives, mothers and sisters of those troops as they gathered on Kyiv's central Maidan Square to beg the world to intervene. The families of the men in the Ukrainian regiment who've been barricaded under the Mariupol plant for two months, living under relentless Russian bombing, are demanding they be rescued. They know time is running out. Video from inside the plant makes it hard to imagine how anyone has survived there for this long. The Ukrainian government has offered to swap the soldiers, some of them badly injured, for Russian prisoners of war. The fighters, members of the Azov Regiment, are close to starving. Many have had limbs amputated by medics operating without proper supplies in the Soviet-era tunnels under the steelworks. Lilia Stupina told Patta that the world is not doing enough to rescue the fighters, including her husband Andrey, whom she met in high school. ""I will take a gun and go to Mariupol by myself,"" she told CBS News. ""I will do everything to save him."" Some of the Azov Regiment family members have launched a global campaign, pushing the West to intervene to allow their soldiers to escape the steel plant. Two wives, Kateryna Prokopenko, 27, and Yuliya Fedosiuk, 29, visited Pope Francis at the Vatican on Wednesday, with one urging the pontiff: ""Please don't let them die."" The women spoke with Francis for about five minutes after his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square, asking him to push Russian President Vladimir Putin personally to let the men escape the steelworks to a third country, because ""Russian captivity is not an option."" Across Ukraine's south and east, the fighting hasn't let up for weeks. Civilians forced to flee the towns and cities of the region have witnessed horrors no one should ever have to see. ""The young have no future. The old have no past,"" said a teenage boy, wise beyond his years thanks to the man-made disaster inflicted upon his country.

But, village by village, Ukraine's defenders are pushing Russia's forces back from the northern outskirts of Kharkiv, toward the Russian border. As Vladimir Putin's troops retreat, they leave a trail of death and destruction in their wake. Countless Ukrainians have lost their homes, their hope — virtually everything but their lives. And thousands more have paid the ultimate price. The loved ones gathered Thursday on Maidan Square in Kyiv were desperate to prevent further losses.

In the Thursday speech, OSCE Ambassador Michael Carpenter said the U.S. believes Russian forces have ""relocated at least several thousand Ukrainians for processing"" in so-called ""filtration camps"" and have also moved ""at least tens of thousands more to Russia or Russia-controlled territory."" Carpenter's description of the detention centers included an explanation of why they're called filtration camps. ""Numerous eyewitness accounts indicate that 'filtering out' entails beating and torturing individuals to determine whether they owe even the slightest allegiance to the Ukrainian state,"" he said. ""According to these reports, those who are judged to have such an allegiance are transferred to the so-called 'Donetsk People's Republic,' where they face a dark fate."" Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, two regions that share a border with Russia, have seen a relentless military offensive, as troops tear through small towns en route to the strategic cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. Carpenter quoted a survivor of the Russian processing who said that those who did not pass the ""filtration"" process were shot. And he referred to satellite images that showed some of these makeshift encampments in southeastern Ukraine. ""Victims describe an invasive and humiliating process of inspection at these centers,"" he said. ""Russia's soldiers photograph victims from various angles, fingerprint and physically examine them for tattoos, inspect their cell phones and download their contacts and data onto devices, and record their biographic information in a variety of databases. Some victims report being interrogated by suspected Russian intelligence officials. In some cases, Russia's soldiers confiscated passports, identification documents, and cell phones altogether."" ""As Russia well knows, the forced displacement or transfer of civilians would contravene international humanitarian law – but as we have seen, the Kremlin treats international law with total contempt,"" he added. In his speech Thursday, Carpenter also decried Russia's ""vicious and brutal military campaign"" and said Russian forces are removing elected officials from local offices. He cited ""very credible"" reports that those officials are being ""kidnapped, interned, disappeared, and sometimes killed."" ""In their place, according to these reports, Russia is substituting its puppets and proxies, who, like their counterparts in the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk ""people's republics,"" operate in the style of a local mafia, relying on violence and terror,"" Carpenter said. He said the U.S. is particularly concerned about Kherson, where Russia has reportedly installed a pro-Russia ""puppet administration"" and mandated the use of the Russian currency, the ruble. Carpenter also said Russia's actions have ""increasingly indicated"" that Russia may move to annex the region. The news comes as Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers that the U.S. believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for ""a prolonged conflict in Ukraine."" Haines said Putin likely believes Russia has a ""greater ability and willingness to endure challenges"" than Ukraine — but also said that if his belief does not match the Russian army's capabilities, there's a risk of a ""more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory"" in the conflict.",45,3.9591425276985825,3.5491292489919104,0.41001327870667215,25

He says Vladimir Putin is ""certainly"" a war criminal.","London — As Ukrainian authorities and the international community work to meticulously collate mounting evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the last surviving prosecutor from the Nuremberg trials of World War II-era Nazi officials told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""certainly"" a war criminal. Benjamin Ferencz, now 102, fought in some of the most significant battles of World War II. He was a young lawyer, recently graduated from Harvard Law School, when he was assigned to a unit tasked with gathering evidence of the Nazi's war crimes in Europe. ""It was horror. It was incredible and indescribable. My job was to get into the concentration camps as they were being liberated, so by the time I got there, the SS was fleeing. The American army was chasing them, and the ground was covered with dead people, some of them still partly alive, pleading with their eyes for help. All of them looked like they were starving. It was not only an unforgettable experience, it was completely traumatic, and I always have that picture,"" Ferencz told CBS News. He led a team of researchers that found a cache of German documents outlining the systematic mass murder of mainly Jewish people outside of the Nazis' concentration camps, in the towns where they lived. At the age of just 27, he ended up prosecuting 22 leaders of Nazi units at Nuremburg for those crimes. All were found guilty. ""It was obviously so horrible that you can't go away from that saying, 'Well, that was a one-time shot.' It's been repeated again and again, and it goes on today. As we talk, people are being shot and killed who had nothing to do with the war [in Ukraine],"" Ferencz said. ""So, evils that I sought — Nuremberg sought — to correct, are still with us today, and we have begun to build a foundation which is more humane and rational, but we have a lot more to go."" Ferencz has joined Ukraine's foreign minister, former world leaders, and legal scholars in advocating for the creation of a special Nuremberg-style international tribunal to try the leadership of the Russian Federation for the war crime of aggression, which is the act of waging an illegal war. Ferencz said it would be an important move ""not only in the context of this case… but to state the principle that you may not commit aggression against a neighboring state, or anybody."" In the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine — barring an extremely unlikely referral from the United Nations Security Council, where Russia has veto power — the International Criminal Court does not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, so a separate tribunal would be necessary for an indictment. And while culpability for other war crimes might not make it all the way up the chain of command to Putin himself, the crime of aggression could. ""Certainly he's a war criminal. You don't have to think too much about that,"" Ferencz told CBS News. As to whether Putin himself will ever actually face justice, Ferencz acknowledged, ""that's another question. Justice is a big term, for one thing. He's a man who has been elected to office. He has supporters in the country."" Ferencz offered a simple message to Putin: ""Stop it… The use of force has really become obsolete in our time, because our capacity to kill has exceeded our capacity to help people, and we've got to turn that around."" Ferencz said the world should turn away from using force in general, and rely on courts of law instead. ""We ought to recognize humanity should come first, and a more humane and peaceful world should be our goal, not a more powerful [world]. You have to be tolerant. You have to be patient. You have to be persistent,"" he told CBS News. ""When you get to be 102, you'll say: 'I knew a guy — 102 — and that's what he was preaching. And you know what, he was right.'""",45,4.963225944747977,4.487104477182854,0.4761214675651235,8

Video appears to show burnt-out Russian vehicles in the area, backing up President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's claim that his forces have managed to push Russian troops back from Ukraine's second-largest city. Drone video appears to show a Russian tank destroyed near Kharkiv. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata says Ukrainian soldiers who drove Russian forces out of areas northeast of the city found rows of bullet-riddled cars, scattered clothes, a baby's car seat and a stroller among other possible evidence of civilians being killed even as they tried to flee. The Ukrainian military — and Ukrainian civilians — have little defense against Russia's overwhelming firepower. As D'Agata reports, the Russians have made gains elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, where their brutal assault has been focused. Nadiya, who lives in the front-line town of Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region, said that when she and her husband found out where a recent airstrike had hit, they rushed to the neighborhood as fast as they could. They quickly found the bodies of their relatives. ""They were kind, very good people,"" she said. The Russian offensive in Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together form Ukraine's industrial Donbas region, has been relentless. Vladimir Putin's forces have flattened small towns in their march toward the strategic cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. But if and when they reach those cities, D'Agata says they will hit a major hurdle. Across a vast section of eastern Ukraine, the fight has become a bloody battle of trench warfare, and the country's defenders have dug in deep. D'Agata and his team found heavily-fortified cities protected by well-armed troops in seemingly endless bunkers, with concrete blocks and anti-tank defenses ringing the outskirts. Right in the center of Slovyansk, about 100 miles southeast of Kharkiv, D'Agata found Ukrainian troops ready and waiting for any Russian forces in vast network of trenches. The soldiers told CBS News that any Russian invaders would face guerrilla warfare at every turn. D'Agata asked Volodymyr Kutnenko, a medic who's been battling Russian separatists in the region since Putin last invaded in 2014, if he had treated any wounded Russian soldiers? ""Yes, yes,"" he said. ""We provide them with the full range of medical support, exchange them for our prisoners of war. But our prisoners of war are returned in a terrible medical condition."" As the ground war inches ever closer to the city, the soldiers told CBS News they know the most difficult days lie ahead.",7,3.3547287979561933,2.52586545925444,0.8288633387017534,19

A local official said at least one person was killed and several wounded when the rockets slammed into a shopping mall and a warehouse in the southern coastal city on Monday. Russia has hammered Ukraine's southern Black Sea coast with missiles and artillery since President Vladimir Putin ordered his invasion on February 24. While his forces have now seized Mariupol, anther strategic port to the east of Odesa, an estimated 1,000 Ukrainian forces remain holed-up in tunnels under a sprawling steelworks there. An aide to Mariupol's mayor said Tuesday that about 100 civilians were still there, too, waiting for evacuation from the decimated plant. To the north, a local official near the battered city of Kharkiv said 44 bodies were discovered in the rubble of a residential building flattened by Russian bombs in March. ""This is another horrible war crime of the Russian occupiers against the civilian population!"" regional governor Oleh Synehubov said on social media. As CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports, the grim reality on the ground is completely detached from what Putin's government is telling the Russian people. While Putin attended jubilant ""Victory Day"" celebrations Monday in Moscow, which mark the former Soviet Union's role in defeating Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime in World War II, present-day Russia has nothing to celebrate about the war in Ukraine. Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Kristina Kvien told Patta bluntly that Putin's war is failing. ""It would be hard to find something that he could claim victory for,"" she told CBS News. ""Frankly, I haven't seen any clear victories at all in this war so far for President Putin."" No victories, perhaps, but Patta says the Russian leader's 76-day war has caused untold misery. Across the east and south of the country, his military continues to punish towns and villages for refusing to capitulate. The jagged remains of the shopping mall in Odesa are just the latest testament to the seemingly sadistic nature of Russia's assault. The city has been bracing for an all-out Russian attack for weeks but so far, Putin's war machine is keeping a distance. The horrors of the Russian leader's war of attrition extend hundreds of miles to the north, and all the way to the border with Russia in the east, with the worst of the fighting focused on the Donetsk and Luhansk breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine's Donbas. It's hard to believe that anyone or anything survived the devastation in the front-line village of Seversk, in Donetsk, where the ashes of Russia's onslaught were still smoldering this week. But an elderly pensioner said she had escaped heavy shelling over the weekend, laying flat on her bed and clinging to hope during the bombing raids. ""My son is dead,"" she wept. ""I have no one to protect me."" But for all the damage caused by its heavy artillery, Russia has become locked in a modern-day David versus Goliath battle, and it has suffered significant losses. Up north, Ukrainian forces have been pushing Russian troops back from Kharkiv, just as they did around Kyiv in April. People have been slowly returning to the capital, which Russia's ground forces never managed to penetrate. ""I've just returned to the house for the first time. It was a little emotional,"" said Ambassador Kvien, who was back in Kyiv after spending weeks further west — even outside of Ukraine — as the capital was deemed unsafe. ""It was really special to be back. I'm so happy to be here and see all my old friends."" And as Patta reports, the American diplomat is not alone. Amidst all the pain, there are occasional moments of joy, including a moment on Monday when a mother was reunited with her son after he spent 74 days fighting on the front lines.",47,2.2685050060021044,2.429958611381747,-0.1614536053796427,21
2022-05-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-conflict-putin-prolonged/,"Putin preparing for ""prolonged conflict"" in Ukraine, intel chief says","Russia's war in Ukraine is unlikely to end even if its forces are successful in taking the country's eastern Donbas region, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said Tuesday, as President Putin banks on diminishing Western resolve to achieve goals extending past the Donbas and across the coast to neighboring Moldova. ""We assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas,"" Haines told lawmakers on the Senate Armed Services Committee during an annual hearing on worldwide threats. She noted that entrenched military engagement means there's no ""viable negotiating path forward"" for Ukraine and Russia in the immediate term. Haines said Putin likely believes his own country has a ""greater ability and willingness to endure challenges"" and is""probably counting on U.S. and E.U. resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse."" But the Russian leader's ambitions may not match his army's military capabilities, Haines said, raising the risk of a ""more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory"" in the conflict. She said Russian ground combat forces have been ""degraded considerably,"" and could take ""years"" to rebuild – which could make Putin could reach for asymmetric or ""more drastic"" measures, including ""imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production or potentially escalatory military actions"" if he perceives Russia is losing, Haines said. A senior U.S. defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces were ""two weeks or more"" behind schedule in the south and east, calling their progress in the Donbas ""very uneven and incremental."" Haines also told the panel Russia has likely held back from launching significant cyberattacks in Ukraine out of concern for their ""collateral impact,"" including impeding the Kremlin's own ability to gather intelligence. On Tuesday, the U.S., European Union and United Kingdom officially blamed the Russian government for hacking satellite telecommunication modems in Ukraine and parts of Europe on February 24, in what the governments said was a coordinated attack coinciding with the Russian invasion. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said in a statement that this attack ""had spillover impacts into other European countries,"" which in effect, ""disabled very small aperture terminals in Ukraine and across Europe,"" including ""tens of thousands of terminals outside of Ukraine that, among other things, support wind turbines and provide Internet services to private citizens."" ""That attack had an outsized impact,"" Haines told lawmakers. Russia""intended to focus on Ukrainian command and control, but ultimately, they ended up affecting a much broader set… of terminals outside of Ukraine, including in Europe,"" she said. Haines noted the intelligence community assesses that Russia has not waged a large-scale cyber attack against the U.S. amid its invasion of Ukraine due to ""longstanding concern about the potential for escalation in cyber vis-a-vis the United States."" But, she added, ""That doesn't mean that they won't attack at some point."" In Ukraine, an escalation of the conflict could also take the form of attacks on deliveries of Western security assistance, retaliation for sanctions or the staging of ""another large nuclear exercise,"" Haines testified, though she said the intelligence community had detected no ""imminent potential"" for Putin to use nuclear weapons. Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, told lawmakers the conflict was ""at a bit of a stalemate here."" ""I think I would characterize it as the Russians aren't winning, and the Ukrainians aren't winning,"" he said. Russia could mobilize additional reserve forces – bringing thousands of more soldiers into the battle – but absent a declaration of war, Berrier said, ""I don't see a breakout on either side."" Both intelligence officials said China's leadership was closely following developments related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict but that current U.S. assessments did not indicate an accelerated timeline for an attempted military takeover of Taiwan.

Russian forces are accused of striking the school — where dozens of civilians were sheltering — in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, which is bearing the brunt of Putin's war. The regional governor of Ukraine's Luhansk province said the school in the village of Bilohorivka was set alight by Saturday's bombing. He said rescue crews managed to save about 30 people, but dozens more were feared dead amid the debris as there were believed to be about 90 civilians taking shelter there when the building was hit. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, Russian forces continue to pummel front-line cities and towns across the two regions of the Donbas, Luhansk and Donetsk. As the bombs continue to fall, many are already calling the attack on the school in Bilohorivka yet another war crime by Russian troops. The building was reduced to smoldering rubble after what Ukrainian authorities say was a direct hit. Terrified families were among those who had sought shelter from Russia's bombardment in the basement of the school. D'Agata says he and his team have found evidence of indiscriminate Russian shelling everywhere they've visited across eastern Ukraine. The battle-scarred village of Velyka Novosilka, which sits right on the warpath Russian forces advancing from the south, is no exception. A U.S. defense official tells CBS News that about 10,000 Russian troops are believed to be on the move north of Mariupol, massing on the outskirts of Velyka Novosilka which, judging from the heavy damage, has clearly come under repeated attack already. D'Agata came upon residents Iryna Ilyenko and her neighbor Valentyna Hadjynova surveying the ruins of their homes. Even as they looked at the damage, the crack of mortar fire and artillery echoed constantly around the village. Ilyenko told CBS News she couldn't leave her bedridden husband behind, so ""whatever God has prepared from me, let it be."" Northeast of the village, the city of Kramatorsk is also in the firing line. Residential neighborhoods there have already been devastated by Russian firepower. Walking through the ruins, D'Agata saw children's toys and other personal belongings — evidence of more lives torn apart by Putin's relentless drive to seize a vast chunk of eastern Ukraine for Russia. Ukraine's forces have managed to slow down Russia's ground offensive, but they've got little defense against Putin's artillery and airstrikes, and the intensity of Russia's bombardment has only worsened by the day.",47,2.6237073597589813,1.2647427203469102,1.3589646394120711,21
2022-05-08,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-bombs-school-bilohorivka/,Dozens feared dead after Russian bomb levels school in Ukraine,"Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine — Dozens of Ukrainians were feared dead Sunday after a Russian bomb destroyed a school sheltering about 90 people in the basement as Moscow's invading forces kept up their barrage of cities, towns and villages in eastern and southern Ukraine. The governor of Luhansk province, one of two areas that make up the eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas, said the school in the village of Bilohorivka caught fire after Saturday's bombing. Emergency crews found two bodies and rescued 30 people, he said. ""Most likely, all 60 people who remain under the rubble are now dead,"" Gov. Serhiy Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Russian shelling also killed two boys, ages 11 and 14, in the nearby town of Pryvillia, he said. Since failing to capture Ukraine's capital, Russia has focused its offensive in the Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting since 2014 and occupy some territory. The largest European conflict since World War II has developed into a punishing war of attrition due to the Ukrainian military's unexpectedly effective defense. To demonstrate success, the Russian military worked to complete its conquest of the besieged port city of Mariupol, which has been under relentless assault since the start of the war, in time for Victory Day celebrations on Monday. A sprawling seaside steel mill is the only part of the city not under Russian control. All the remaining women, children and older civilians who had been sheltering with Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal plant were evacuated Saturday. The troops still inside have refused to surrender; hundreds are believed to be wounded. After rescuers evacuated the last civilians Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address that the focus would turn to extracting the wounded and medics. Zelenskyy said in his nightly address that work would also continue Sunday on securing humanitarian corridors for residents of Mariupol and surrounding towns to leave. The Ukrainian government has been reaching out to international organizations to try to secure safe passage for the estimated 2,000 fighters remaining in the plant's underground tunnels and bunkers. Zelenskyy acknowledged the difficulty, but said: ""We are not losing hope, we are not stopping. Every day we are looking for some diplomatic option that might work."" The Ukrainian leader was expected to hold online talks Sunday with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, President Biden and leaders from other Group of Seven countries. The meeting is partly meant to display unity among Western allies on Victory in Europe Day, which marks Nazi Germany's 1945 surrender. Elsewhere on Ukraine's coast, explosions echoed again Sunday across the major Black Sea port of Odesa, which Russia struck with six cruise missiles on Saturday. Authorities offered no immediate damage reports. The Odesa city council said four of the missiles launched Saturday hit a furniture company, with the shock waves and debris badly damaging high-rise apartment buildings. The other two hit the Odesa airport, where a previous Russian attack destroyed the runway. Ukrainian leaders warned that attacks would only worsen in the lead-up to Victory Day. Russian President Vladimir Putin is believed to want to proclaim some kind of triumph in Ukraine when he addresses the troops on Red Square on Monday. In neighboring Moldova, Russian and separatists troops were on ""full alert,"" the Ukrainian military warned. The region has increasingly become a focus of worries that the conflict could expand beyond Ukraine's borders. Pro-Russian forces broke off the Transnistria section of Moldova in 1992, and Russian troops have been stationed there since, ostensibly as peacekeepers. Those forces are on ""full combat readiness,"" Ukraine said, without giving details on how it came to the assessment. Moscow has sought to sweep across southern Ukraine both to cut off the country from the Black Sea and to create a corridor to Transnistria. But it has struggled to achieve those objectives. In a sign of the dogged resistance that has sustained the fighting into its 11th week, Ukraine's military struck Russian positions on a Black Sea island that was captured in the war's first days and has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press showed Ukraine targeting Russian-held Snake Island in a bid to impede Russia's efforts to control the sea. A satellite image taken Sunday morning by Planet Labs PBC showed smoke rising from two sites on the island. On the island's southern edge, a fire smoked next to debris. That corresponded to a video released by the Ukrainian military showing a strike on a Russian helicopter that had flown to the island. A Planet Labs image from Saturday showed most of the island's buildings, as well as what appeared to be a Serna-class landing craft, destroyed by Ukrainian drone attacks. The most intense combat in recent days has taken place in eastern Ukraine. A Ukrainian counteroffensive near Kharkiv, a city in the northeast that is the country's second-largest, ""is making significant progress and will likely advance to the Russian border in the coming days or weeks,"" according to the Institute for the Study of War. The Washington-based think tank added that ""the Ukrainian counteroffensive demonstrates promising Ukrainian capabilities."" However, the Ukrainian army withdrew from Luhansk province's embattled city of Popasna, Haidai, the regional governor, said Sunday. In a video interview posted on his Telegram channel, Haidai said that Kyiv's troops had ""moved to stronger positions, which they had prepared ahead of time."" The Russia-backed rebels have established a breakaway region in Luhansk and neighboring Donetsk, which together make up the Donbas. Russia has targeted areas still under Ukrainian control. ""All free settlements in the Luhansk region are hot spots,"" Haidai said. ""Right now, there are shooting battles in (the villages) of Bilohorivka, Voivodivka and towards Popasna.""",47,3.175887220219937,1.568664359423337,1.6072228607966,19

Russian and Ukrainian officials said 50 people were evacuated from the Azovstal plant and handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Russian military said the group included 11 children. Russian officials and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said evacuation efforts would continue Saturday. The latest evacuees were in addition to roughly 500 other civilians who got out of the plant and city in recent days. The fight for the last Ukrainian stronghold in a city reduced to ruins by the Russian onslaught appeared increasingly desperate amid growing speculation that President Vladimir Putin wants to finish the battle for Mariupol so he can present a triumph to the Russian people in time for Monday's Victory Day, the biggest patriotic holiday on the Russian calendar. As the holiday commemorating the Soviet Union's World War II victory over Nazi Germany approached, cities across Ukraine prepared for an expected increase in Russian attacks, and officials urged residents to heed air raid warnings. ""These symbolic dates are to the Russian aggressor like red to a bull,"" said Ukraine's first deputy interior minister, Yevhen Yenin. ""While the entire civilized world remembers the victims of terrible wars on these days, the Russian Federation wants parades and is preparing to dance over bones in Mariupol."" By Russia's most recent estimate, roughly 2,000 Ukrainian fighters are holed up in the vast maze of tunnels and bunkers beneath the Azovstal steelworks, and they have repeatedly refused to surrender. Ukrainian officials said before Friday's evacuations that a few hundred civilians were also trapped there, and fears for their safety have increased as the battle has grown fiercer in recent days. Kateryna Prokopenko, whose husband, Denys Prokopenko, commands the Azov Regiment troops inside the plant, issued a desperate plea to also spare the fighters. She said they would be willing to go to a third country to wait out the war but would never surrender to Russia because that would mean ""filtration camps, prison, torture and death."" If nothing is done to save her husband and his men, they will ""stand to the end without surrender,"" she told The Associated Press on Friday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ""influential states"" are involved in efforts to rescue the soldiers, although he did not mention any by name. ""We are also working on diplomatic options to save our troops who are still at Azovstal,"" he said in his nightly video address. U.N. officials have been tight-lipped about the civilian evacuation efforts, but it seemed likely that the latest evacuees would be taken to Zaporizhzhia, a Ukrainian-controlled city about 140 miles northwest of Mariupol where others who escaped the port city were brought. Some of the plant's previous evacuees spoke to the AP about the horrors of being surrounded by death in the moldy, underground bunker with little food and water, poor medical care and diminishing hope. Some said they felt guilty for leaving others behind. ""People literally rot like our jackets did,"" said 31-year-old Serhii Kuzmenko, who fled with his wife, 8-year-old daughter and four others from their bunker, where 30 others were left behind. ""They need our help badly. We need to get them out."" Fighters defending the plant said Friday on the Telegram messaging app that Russian troops had fired on an evacuation vehicle on the plant's grounds. They said the car was moving toward civilians when it was hit by shelling, and that one soldier was killed and six were wounded. Moscow did not immediately acknowledge renewed fighting there Friday. Russia took control of the rest of Mariupol after bombarding it for two months. Ahead of Victory Day, municipal workers and volunteers cleaned up what remains of the city, which had a prewar population of more than 400,000. Perhaps 100,000 civilians remain there with scarce supplies of food, water, electricity and heat. Bulldozers scooped up debris, and people swept streets against a backdrop of hollowed-out buildings. Russian flags were hoisted. The fall of Mariupol would deprive Ukraine of a vital port. It would also allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free some Russian troops to fight elsewhere in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that the Kremlin says is now its chief objective. Its capture also holds symbolic value since the city has been the scene of some of the worst suffering of the war and a surprisingly fierce resistance. While they pounded away at the plant, Russian forces struggled to make significant gains elsewhere, 10 weeks into a devastating war that has killed thousands of people, forced millions to flee the country and flattened large swaths of cities. Ukrainian officials said the risk of massive shelling increased ahead of Victory Day. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said authorities would reinforce street patrols in the capital. A curfew was going into effect in Ukraine's southern Odesa region, which was the target of two missile attacks Friday. The Ukrainian military's general staff said Friday that its forces repelled 11 attacks in the Donbas region and destroyed tanks and armored vehicles, further frustrating Putin's ambitions after his attempt to seize Kyiv. Russia made no acknowledgement of the losses. The Ukrainian army also said it made progress in the northeastern Kharkiv region, recapturing five villages and part of a sixth. Meanwhile, one person was reported dead and three more were wounded Friday as a result of Russian shelling in Lyman, a city in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region.",47,1.881929484632865,1.6769885024909943,0.20494098214187062,19

The Ukrainian troops holed-up at the plant are the last holdouts in a city Russia now controls. British intelligence suggests there's new urgency in Moscow for President Vladimir Putin's invading forces to seize the facility, for reasons of propaganda. A senior Red Cross official confirmed to CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata that another rescue operation was underway Friday. Between the relentless bombing raids on the besieged steelworks, rescue teams have somehow managed to evacuate almost 500 civilians over the last week or so in what the Red Cross official called a ""very difficult and dangerous operation."" The gun battles have continued, and a commander of the Russian-backed separatist forces in the region claimed the Ukrainian troops in the plant had run out of ammunition. He said his fighters would ""try to take it all"" by May 9. That's ""Victory Day,"" when Russia celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany. Definitively conquering Mariupol ahead of that date would hand President Putin a badly needed war trophy. But as D'Agata reports, it would come at a horrific human cost. Survivors have described escaping from ""a living hell"" under the steelworks, and many carry deep psychological scars from the ordeal, International Committee of the Red Cross spokesman Chris Hanger told CBS News. He said when ICRC teams met some of the civilians who had made it out, ""they were obviously devastated that they had not seen the sky for over two months, and the moment they got out, they saw their city — their home — completely destroyed, so some people were asking for a priest. Some people were just crying, and some people were just silent."" Tetyana Trotsak, 25, cuddled her dog Daisy and marveled at ""the blue sky and the bright sun"" when she emerged. ""I hope there will never be any kind of booms here,"" she said, ""just fireworks and thunder.""

D'Agata asked her brother Oleksiy about the conditions in the town. ""It was hard,"" he said. ""We didn't have water. No internet connection. We were hiding in the basement, and the Russians looted the supermarkets."" With the whole family back together and exchanging hugs, they said it was ""the best day."" But the whole region — a vast swathe of eastern Ukraine stretching from north to south — is bracing for much darker days to come.

Russia denied claims that its forces had entered the compound and insisted that a humanitarian corridor — protected under a three-day cease-fire announced by Moscow to enable the remaining civilians to escape — was open and ""working."" As the fight for full control of the strategic port city intensified, a Ukrainian commander said there were ""difficult and bloody"" battles playing out around the steelworks — the last stronghold of resistance against the Russian invaders in Mariupol. Brutal fighting continued across a vast swathe of eastern Ukraine, and as CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports, there are American volunteers helping Ukraine's defenders in the battle, and Americans are among the battlefield casualties and heroes. The harder Russia flexes its military muscle, the harder Ukrainians fight back. Manus, a volunteer from the U.S., was blinded by shrapnel in the fighting. ""I'm young, I can take it. I'm a man, I'm young,"" he said. ""It's the kids and old people who I really worry about."" Ukrainian soldier Vitaly Stanislavovitch was also seriously wounded in battle. He told CBS News that he owes his life to three American volunteers.

""I didn't think he was going to make it in that moment,"" Antilla told Patta. ""But we still were going to do everything we could to get him out of the vehicle."" Instinct then kicked in for Rob Vardaro. ""I refused to let him die,"" he told CBS News in an interview done via Zoom. ""He's my guy. He's in my vehicle. So, because I knew I had no time to, like, look where I'm stepping, I ran through the minefield."" Along with their friend Red Taylor, the third American volunteer, they dragged Stanislavovitch from the burning vehicle. Their quick thinking saved his life. ""Especially Alexis, she's a medic,"" the wounded Ukrainian told Patta. The volunteers applied a tourniquet to stop Stanislavovitch bleeding to death. ""Saved my life for sure,"" he said. ""They work magic… I don't know how they managed to save my life."" Now Stanislavovitch is worried about his American friends. Their lives are still in danger, as they've joined the fighting in eastern Ukraine. ""I don't want something to happen to them. I want them to be alive,"" he told Patta. ""It's more than love… I can't imagine my life without my saviors."" Theirs is a friendship forged on a bloody battlefield that shows no signs of letting up, as Russia goes for an all-out assault in the Donbas region. ""I hope I will have some chance to prove that I'm a friend without any wars. I would shake their hands. I would say hello,"" Stanislavovitch said.",47,2.002655600554901,2.0900480909938106,-0.0873924904389094,24
2022-05-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-of-attrition-begun/,"Russia and Ukraine's ""war of attrition"" has begun, says European official","The ""war of attrition"" has begun in Ukraine, as Russian forces make a grinding push using heavy artillery shelling in the south and east of the country alongside deep strikes further west into Ukraine in an attempt to disrupt logistical supply lines used by the West. Predicting when the Russian offensive will end is very complicated, a European official in Washington told reporters Thursday. In the long term, Russian President Vladimir Putin's objective is to capture the broader Donbas region, where Ukrainians and Russians have been fighting since 2014, as well as the land bridge linking mainland Ukraine to Russian-occupied Crimea. However, Russian forces — pushing from the east, south, and from the north area of Izium, in eastern Ukraine, while using heavy artillery shelling — have still not made much progress on the ground, the European official said. The remaining part of the Donbas that the Russians are trying to secure has complex terrain with substantially sized rivers and urban areas. If they succeed in securing and moving past the southern Kherson region, the Russians could push on to the port city of Odesa further west. But this is unlikely because it would require a complex amphibious operation, and Russia also does not have enough troops in place to expand to the southern coast, the official said. If logistical access for supplies isn't secured, troop morale will collapse, the official also pointed out. Russia has also been carrying out deep strikes beyond the line of contact to target resupply lines and western military assistance flowing into Ukraine, carrying out intense bombardment of storage facilities, bridges and railways, as well as missile strikes on power stations in the western city of Lviv on Tuesday. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Wednesday, with regard to Russia's most recent airstrikes, ""we are still assessing the degree to which they hit what they targeted. They are not good at precision strikes. They are not discriminate with how they target."" ""The Russians have not made the kind of progress in the Donbas and in the south that we believe they wanted to make. We do believe they're behind schedule,"" Kirby said. ""It's been slow, and at every turn they have met a stiff Ukrainian resistance. What we're focused on is making sure that that resistance stays as stiff as possible."" Other factors that may affect the duration of the war include morale, agility and intelligence, the European official said. It is difficult to assess the number of Russian casualties, but the European official suggested that Russia has suffered heavy losses during the war, with between 10,000 to 20,000 Russian soldiers killed so far, as well as thirty 30,000 wounded. Ukraine has not released an official death toll of its forces, though President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in mid-April that 3,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since Russia's invasion began. Ukrainian officials did not respond to a request by CBS for their latest figures. The European official also noted it is difficult to predict Russian President Vladimir Putin's mindset, pointing out that while he can stop his invasion of Ukraine at any moment, he has so far shown no willingness to end his campaign. Meanwhile, the Ukrainians have shown they are committed to defend every kilometer of their land. And as the war drags on, Russia will feel the economic effects of the sanctions, which is likely to have practical consequences for Putin's ambition. The Ukrainians, who are receiving a continuous supply of western security assistance, are agile in terms of their military movement, compared with the Russian's heavy and less mobile military, making it easier for the Ukrainians to target them according to this European official. It remains difficult to assess whether Russia is receiving military or security assistance from its allies including China. Ukraine has been able to kill a number of high-level Russian generals who have had to move to the frontlines deeper within the country to try unsnarl their forces' failure to progress. Intelligence from the U.S. and other countries has helped Ukraine achieve this, but it also has its own network of intelligence within its population for generating HUMINT (human intelligence) toward effectively informing their military operations, the European official said. A National Security Council official told CBS News Thursday, ""The United States provides battlefield intelligence to help the Ukrainians defend their country. We do not provide intelligence with the intent to kill Russian generals."" The U.S. assesses that Russia will try to forcibly annex the newly occupied Kherson region, along with the so-called ""people's republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk in the ""coming weeks or months,"" U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter said this week. Carpenter told State Department reporters Monday, ""We believe that the Kremlin may try to hold sham referenda, to try to add a veneer of democratic or electoral legitimacy"" in these regions. Russia is already switching the local schools to using the Russian curriculum, forcing civilians to use the ruble as currency, renaming towns and has cut off internet and cell phone transmission in those areas, Carpenter also said.

He said city officials had ""lost contact"" with Ukrainian forces inside the plant and had no way of knowing ""what's going on, whether they are safe or not"". The Ukrainian military said Tuesday that Russian forces had launched an offensive to rout troops inside Azovstal shortly after the United Nations and Red Cross confirmed that more than 100 civilians had been evacuated from the plant. Russia confirmed it was attacking Ukrainian positions at the plant with ""artillery and aircraft"" but earlier Wednesday the Kremlin denied Russia was storming Azovstal. Boichenko said Russia was attacking with heavy artillery, tanks and war planes, adding that war ships next to coastal steel works were also involved in the attack.

As CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay reports, a ceasefire finally enabled the evacuation of about 100 civilians from tunnels under the Azovstal steel plant over the weekend. That first group — rescued after two months of relentless Russian shelling of the city and the plant — were still headed for safety in Ukrainian-held territory on Tuesday. It's estimated that about 100,000 people are still sheltering in basements and other hiding places around Mariupol. The strategic port city has been pummelled by Russian rockets and artillery since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on February 24. It is now controlled by the invading forces, with only a couple thousand members of the Ukrainian National Guard's Azov Regiment still holding out under the steel plant. With Russia, Ukraine and aid organizations reportedly negotiating to secure the evacuation of the remaining 200 civilians at the steelworks, Livesay said the shelling continued. After six weeks of war, weary residents like Tatyana no longer even flinch at the sound of exploding Russian bombs. She's watched as some 300,000 people have either escaped from the city, or died there. ""You wake up and cry, then you cry in the evening,"" she said. ""I have nowhere else to go."" In much of Russian-occupied Mariupol, the living have become the undertakers. Pharmacist Kristina Burdiuk, 25, said she was offered about $460 ""to sort through the rubble and take out the corpses."" To the north, in what is left of Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv, 95-year-old Yefrosiniia Aksionova left her home for what she feared could be the last time. ""I want this Putin to be battered,"" she said through sobs, ""so he feels what we are going through."" Outgunned and outsized in its war with Russia, Livesay said Ukraine has compensated with heart, and creativity. The country has been unafraid to blow up its own bridges and roads - anything to slow down the Russian advance. Just outside Kyiv, that meant breaching a dam. Doing so inundated the nearby town of Demydiv, flooding homes, possessions and vehicles, but residents were happy to do it because they knew the Russians would have destroyed their town for them otherwise. The drastic measure helped stop Russian troops from reaching Kyiv. One resident, Vladimir, rowed Livesay and his team through the flooded town in a small boat. He said the Russians were stopped there, but a neighbor, Maria, shouted a warning to us in the boat: Some of the invaders' unexploded shells remain — including in her flooded vegetable garden, lurking invisibly under the murky water. Many of the shells did explode, however. Some tore into Maria's neighbor Valentina's house as her family of six hid in the basement, while it slowly filled with water from the breached dam. ""We had to climb out,"" Valentina told CBS News. ""But at the same time, the Russians had to retreat. This water saved us."" Ukraine's ingenuity on the battlefield is paying off. The Pentagon says Russia's invasion has shown ""minimal progress at best,"" suffering from ""poor command and control,"" and ""low morale."" But the fight is far from over. A senior U.S. diplomat said Monday that the U.S. believed Putin was planning to annex large swathes of eastern Ukraine — where the fighting continues to rage — this month, as he did eight years ago with the Crimean Peninsula. Michael Carpenter, U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the expectation was that Russia would orchestrate ""sham referenda"" in the two separatist-held regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which would see them accept Russian dominion. He called the predicted move ""straight out of the Kremlin's playbook,"" and said the U.S. and its allies would not recognize any further unilateral Russian annexations of Ukrainian territory. No Western nation has recognized Putin's claim over Crimea, despite Russia's undisputed control of the Ukrainian peninsula.",47,1.1904654265614918,7.8406292528538355,-6.650163826292344,11

""You're allowing the Ukrainians to defend themselves. And quite frankly, they're making fools of the Russian military in many instances,"" Mr. Biden told the roughly 600 employees gathered there. The president called on Congress to approve his $33 billion supplemental budget request for continued aid to Ukraine, where ""a lot of war crimes are being committed"" by Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces. ""You're making a gigantic difference for these poor sons of guns who are under such enormous, enormous pressure and firepower,"" Mr. Biden said, adding that Ukrainian forces are in possession of ten times more Javelin missiles than there are Russian tanks. Over the past two decades, this Lockheed facility has produced more than 50,000 Javelins. He told the workers Ukrainian parents are naming their newborns ""Javelin"" or ""Javelina"" because of the weapon's effectiveness. President Biden visited an Alabama Lockheed Martin facility that makes , the weapon known as a ""tank killer."" The U.S. has donated more than 5,500 Javelins to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. Videos of the missiles destroying Russian tanks have been spreading online from a number of sources on social media, including the Ukrainian military. The Javelin is known as the ""tank killer"" because of its ""top attack"" capability — it pops up into the air before diving down and targeting the top of tanks, where the armor is the thinnest. Mr. Biden's visit on Tuesday came as the Pentagon and Congress consider the long-term impact for the U.S. of giving so many of these and other weapons to the Ukrainians so quickly. The administration's supplemental budget request includes $550 million to establish the Critical Munitions Acquisition Fund. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the fund would allow the Pentagon ""to purchase and establish a strategic reserve of vital munitions like anti-aircraft and anti-tank munitions and then to surge for this crisis, and quite frankly, crises to come."" The fund would focus on weapons such as the Javelin and another weapon the administration has been sending in the thousands — the Stinger anti-aircraft missile. According to the Defense Department, the administration has given over 1,400 Stinger missiles since the invasion started. The Stinger rose to fame during the 1980s in the Soviet-Afghanistan war when the mujahideen used U.S.-provided Stingers to shoot down Soviet aircraft.. Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes said on an earnings call last week that it could take years to produce more. He said the Pentagon hasn't bought a Stinger in about 18 years, and some of the parts are no longer commercially available, so Raytheon will have to redesign them. ""We'll ramp up production – what we can – this year,"" Hayes said. ""But I would expect this is going to be [20]23, [20]24 where we actually see orders come in for the larger replenishments."" The Pentagon in April hosted a meeting with the CEOs of top weapons companies such as Raytheon to discuss how production lines of weapons like Stingers and Javelins stay healthy. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a press briefing Monday that the Pentagon conducts a readiness assessment before the approval of each assistance package to Ukraine, and so far, the readiness of U.S. forces has not been a concern. He said it's not about looking at the numbers in the inventory of a specific weapon but rather the capability the weapon provides. ""We judge it all as a conglomerate of what's our ability to meet this particular mission set, realizing that a Javelin isn't the only capability you have against armor,"" Kirby said. He said that readiness is not something the Defense Department takes lightly, which is why the Pentagon will continue to talk to the defense industrial base about what's needed going forward. The Javelin has become a household name certainly in Ukraine and potentially across the United States, and Alabama wants to keep it that way. Early in March, Republican Gov. Kay Ivey tweeted about the weapon and said, ""We want the last thing Putin reads to be 'Made in Alabama.'""",49,6.268740876703909,7.590497402476441,-1.3217565257725319,27

The decision to deviate from DHS standard review procedures ""rais[ed] objectivity concerns,"" according to the report, and led to the perception that unorthodox interference by a top DHS official was intended to help Donald Trump's reelection bid. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at DHS, through its Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), released the redacted results of its investigation into Russian interference in the election — ""DHS Actions Related to an I&A Intelligence Product Deviated from Standard Procedures"" — on Tuesday. ""We found that DHS did not adequately follow its internal processes and comply with applicable [intelligence community] policy standards and requirements when editing and disseminating an I&A intelligence product regarding Russian interference with the 2020 U.S. Presidential election,"" the DHS OIG report states, in part. ""The acting secretary participated in the review process multiple times despite lacking any formal role in reviewing the product, resulting in the delay of its dissemination on at least one occasion,"" the DHS inspector general report continued. ""The delays and deviation from I & A standard process and requirements put [them] at risk of creating a perception of politicization."" Analysts in DHS' Cyber Mission Center (CYMC) began drafting the original intelligence product titled, ""Russia Likely to Denigrate Health of US Candidates to Influence 2020 Electoral Dynamics"" in April 2020, to warn state and local governments of a noticeable uptick in Russian state media efforts to question then-candidate President Joe Biden's mental health after Super Tuesday. The DHS analyst who first raised the concern ""believed foreign efforts questioning a candidate's health were worth exploring because they could impact voters' willingness to vote for that candidate and began drafting the product,"" the OIG report read. ""In its initial form, the product was approximately two pages in length and included information relating to one 'current Democratic presidential candidate' and to Russian activities to influence the 2020 U.S. Presidential election."" At a July 8, 2020, meeting, Acting Secretary Chad Wolf — who is referenced to by his title but never named in Tuesday's OIG report — determined that the intelligence document should be ""held"" because it ""made the President look bad,"" according to a whistleblower complaint. The whistleblower, Brian Murphy, who was then principal deputy under secretary at I&A, also alleged that Wolf ordered him to shift the focus of future assessments to interference efforts by China and Iran, and that instructions to do so had come from White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien. Murphy declined to comply, he said in the complaint, because ""doing so would put the country in substantial and specific danger."" ""Russian disinformation was something [DHS leadership] didn't want to report on,"" Murphy previously told CBS News, in an October 2021 interview. ""It mattered. It had a material impact on life and safety of how the events unfolded during 2018 and forward."" ""Wolf told me that the plan with respect to the administration was to downplay Russian disinformation, that was supporting the Democrats… and instead, upscale the threat from China,"" Murphy continued. ""That's where the real manipulation by the politicals came into effect. The same thing with Iran. I'm not dismissing China and Iran as threats, particularly in the disinformation space, but they differ on scale and their objectives. The Russians are the best at it. There's no one that even comes close."" Murphy was later reassigned amid reporting that his office compiled ""intelligence reports"" about journalists and protesters in Portland. Tuesday's report found that, after months of delay, analysts inserted a ""tone box"" – a highlighted section of text – detailing efforts by Chinese and Iranian influence actors to amplify unsubstantiated narratives questioning the mental health of former President Donald Trump. When watchdog investigators probed the CYMC manager on why the additional material – outside the scope of the initial report – was added, the DHS officials contradicted themselves. ""He told us it was a feature intended to draw a contrast between the actions of Russia and those of Iran and China, but also described the tone box as a 'blunting feature' meant to balance the product. When asked whether intelligence products require balancing, he said the addition of the tone box was not politicization, yet also said it showed I & A's political savviness, as the state and local customers of their products tended to be political,"" the OIG report reads. The analytic ombudsman from I & A flagged serious concerns with the September version of the intelligence product, noting in his review that ""problems with the piece undermine the original message and give the perception of a lack of objectivity or an attempt at political influence."" That assessment also suggested the addition of Iran and China ""[seem] to almost avoid the main message that is made explicit in the key judgment — that Russian influence actors are targeting the Democratic candidates in 2020… The tone box on Iran/China seemingly unrelated to the main message are all areas that could be seen as 'being political,' whether intentional or not,"" the assessment read. DHS' top watchdog determined that DHS deviated from its own internal requirements for editing and disseminating the report to state and local partners. ""Since January 2021, the [Office of Intelligence and Analysis] has renewed its commitment to continually assess the policies, guidelines and processes that govern the review and dissemination of its finished intelligence products, including to identity and implement and necessary improvements,"" wrote John Cohen, senior official performing the duties of the under secretary for the office, to Joseph Cuffari, DHS inspector general, in a memo responding to the report. Cohen has since left his role, which is currently being filled by Melissa Smislova. President Biden's nominee to lead the office, Kenneth Wainstein, is awaiting Senate confirmation. ""This troubling report raises concerns over the prior Administration's inappropriate interference in the review and clearance process for an intelligence product,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. ""Under the Biden-Harris Administration and the leadership of Secretary Mayorkas, the Department of Homeland Security is focused on ensuring the safety and security of communities across our country, while conducting our work with integrity and in ways that protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. Since January 2021, DHS has renewed its commitment to providing accurate, timely, and actionable information and intelligence, free from politicization and bias, to the public and our partners across every level of government, in the private sector, and local communities."" Describing its methodology, the DHS watchdog wrote that Wolf requested an interview in writing rather than orally or in-person. According to the report, DHS Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli ""did not provide any responses despite agreeing to do so."" Wolf resigned his post in January 2021, after the Government Accountability Office and several federal judges deemed that he had served illegally, a judgment that he disputes. In March 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on the 2020 elections that found Kremlin-backed agents authorized by President Vladimir Putin tried to use President Trump's inner circle and right-leaning media to undermine his opponent. The report also concluded that while Iran had expanded its efforts to meddle in the 2020 presidential election, China fell short of interfering after determining it was not worth the risk. The intelligence community found ""no indications"" that any foreign actor made attempts to alter technical aspects of the voting process, despite making false claims meant to undermine confidence in election results.",20,6.717797741344165,9.128459370310107,-2.4106616289659426,18
2022-05-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mariupol-ukraine-russia-steel-plant-evacuations/,Russia storms steel plant in Mariupol as some evacuees reach safety,"Russian forces on Tuesday began storming the steel mill containing the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol, Ukrainian defenders said, just as scores of civilians evacuated from the bombed-out plant reached relative safety and told of days and nights filled with dread and despair from constant shelling. Osnat Lubrani, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said that thanks to the evacuation effort over the weekend, 101 people — including women, the elderly, and 17 children, the youngest 6 months old — were able to emerge from the bunkers under the Azovstal steelworks and ""see the daylight after two months."" One evacuee said she went to sleep at the plant every night afraid she wouldn't wake up. ""You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the shelter, in a wet and damp basement which is bouncing, shaking,"" 54-year-old Elina Tsybulchenko said upon arriving in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles northwest of Mariupol, in a convoy of buses and ambulances. She added: ""We were praying to God that missiles fly over our shelter, because if it hit the shelter, all of us would be done."" Evacuees, a few of whom were in tears, made their way from the buses into a tent offering some of the comforts long denied them during their weeks underground, including hot food, diapers and connections to the outside world. Mothers fed small children. Some of the evacuees browsed racks of donated clothing, including new underwear. The news for those left behind was more grim. Ukrainian commanders said Russian forces backed by tanks began storming the sprawling plant, which includes a maze of tunnels and bunkers spread out over 4 square miles. How many Ukrainian fighters were holed up inside was unclear, but the Russians put the number at about 2,000 in recent weeks, and 500 were reported to be wounded. A few hundred civilians also remained there, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. ""We'll do everything that's possible to repel the assault, but we're calling for urgent measures to evacuate the civilians that remain inside the plant and to bring them out safely,"" Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of Ukraine's Azov Regiment, said on the messaging app Telegram. He added that throughout the night, the plant was hit with naval artillery fire and airstrikes. Two civilian women were killed and 10 civilians wounded, he said. The U.N.'s Lubrani expressed hope for further evacuations but said none had been worked out. In other battlefield developments, Russian troops shelled a chemical plant in the eastern city of Avdiivka, killing at least 10 people, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. ""The Russians knew exactly where to aim — the workers just finished their shift and were waiting for a bus at a bus stop to take them home,"" Kyrylenko wrote in a Telegram post. ""Another cynical crime by Russians on our land."" Explosions were also heard in Lviv, in western Ukraine, near the Polish border. The strikes damaged three power substations, knocking out electricity in parts of the city and disrupting the water supply, and wounded two people, the mayor said. Lviv has been a gateway for NATO-supplied weapons and a haven for those fleeing the fighting in the east. A rocket also struck an infrastructure facility in a mountainous area in Transcarpathia, a region in far western Ukraine that borders Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, authorities said. There was no immediate word of any casualties. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian aircraft and artillery hit hundreds of targets in the past day, including troop strongholds, command posts, artillery positions, fuel and ammunition depots and radar equipment. Ukrainian authorities said the Russians also attacked at least a half-dozen railroad stations around the country. The assault on the Azovstal steelworks began almost two weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military not to storm the plant to finish off the defenders but to seal it off. The first — and so far only — civilians to be evacuated from the shattered plant got out during a brief cease-fire in an operation overseen by the U.N. and the Red Cross. At a reception center in Zaporizhzhia, stretchers and wheelchairs were lined up, and children's shoes and toys awaited the convoy. Medical and psychological teams were on standby. Some of the elderly evacuees appeared exhausted as they arrived. Some of the younger people, especially mothers comforting babies and other young children, appeared relieved. ""I'm very glad to be on Ukrainian soil,"" said a woman who gave only her first name, Anna, and arrived with two children, ages 1 and 9. ""We thought we wouldn't get out of there, frankly speaking."" A small group of women held up signs in English asking that fighters also be evacuated from the steel plant. The arrival of the evacuees was a rare piece of good news in the nearly 10-week conflict that has killed thousands, forced millions to flee the country, laid waste to towns and cities, and shifted the post-Cold War balance of power in Eastern Europe. ""Over the past days, traveling with the evacuees, I have heard mothers, children and frail grandparents speak about the trauma of living day after day under unrelenting heavy shelling and the fear of death, and with extreme lack of water, food and sanitation,"" Lubrani said. ""They spoke of the hell they have experienced."" In addition to the 101 people evacuated from the steelworks, 58 joined the convoy in a town on the outskirts of Mariupol, Lubrani said. About 30 people who left the plant decided to stay behind in Mariupol to try to find out whether their loved ones were alive, Lubrani said. A total of 127 evacuees arrived in Zaporizhzhia, she said. The Russian military said earlier that some of the evacuees chose to stay in areas held by pro-Moscow separatists. About a dozen people taken out in the convoy were sick or injured, none of them critically, according to Pascal Hundt, head of the Ukraine office of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Tsybulchenko rejected Russian allegations that the Ukrainian fighters wouldn't allow civilians to leave the plant. She said the Ukrainian military told civilians that they were free to go but would be risking their lives if they did so. ""We understood clearly that under these murder weapons, we wouldn't survive, we wouldn't manage to go anywhere,"" she said. Mariupol has come to symbolize the human misery inflicted by the war. The Russians' two-month siege of the strategic southern port has trapped civilians with little or no food, water, medicine or heat, as Moscow's forces pounded the city into rubble. The plant in particular has transfixed the outside world. Russian forces have also tried to overrun the frontline town of Lysychansk for weeks. As CBS News arrived, an artillery barrage echoed through deserted streets. With the Russians less than three miles away, only a handful of mostly elderly residents remain in the eastern town in desperate conditions. A Russian airstrike left a crater on the doorstep of an apartment block as people were taking shelter in the basement. Residents gathered water from a broken pipe. A resident named Vladymyr said he can't leave because his 84-year-old mother can't travel. His neighbor, Ludmilla, described explosions throughout the night that sent shards of glass flying. ""People who were able to, have left — those with kids,"" she said. ""We, the old ones, are staying here."" Despite Russia's tactics to bombard from a distance, its ground forces have so far made only modest gains. It's because Russian forces won't fight toe-to-toe with Ukrainian soldiers, Special Forces Major Oleksandr told CBS News. ""They're just burning everything to the ground,"" he said. After failing to take Kyiv in the early weeks of the war, Russia withdrew from around the capital and announced that its chief objective was the capture of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, known as the Donbas. Mariupol lies in the region, and its fall would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops for fighting elsewhere in the Donbas. But so far, Russia's troops and their allied separatist forces appear to have made only minor gains in the eastern offensive. Ukraine's resistance has been significantly bolstered by Western arms, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced 300 million pounds ($375 million) in new military aid, including radar, drones and armored vehicles. In a speech delivered remotely to Ukraine's parliament, he pronounced the battle Ukraine's ""finest hour,"" echoing the words of Winston Churchill during World War II. ""Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free,"" Johnson said.",47,7.248771753201382,0.988399995384792,6.26037175781659,19
2022-05-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/evacuations-under-way-in-mariupol-pelosi-visits-ukraine/,Evacuations under way in Mariupol; Pelosi visits Ukraine,"A long-awaited evacuation of civilians from a besieged steel plant in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol was under way Sunday, as U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi revealed that she visited Ukraine's president to show unflinching American support for the country's defense against Russia's invasion. Video posted online by Ukrainian forces showed elderly women and mothers with small children bundled in winter clothing being helped as they climbed a steep pile of debris from the sprawling Azovstal steel plant's rubble, and then eventually boarded a bus. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 100 civilians, primarily women and children, were expected to arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday. ""Today, for the first time in all the days of the war, this vitally needed (humanitarian) corridor has started working,"" he said in a pre-recorded address published on his Telegram messaging app channel. The Mariupol City Council said on Telegram that the evacuation of civilians from other parts of the city would begin Monday morning. People fleeing Russian-occupied areas in the past have described their vehicles being fired on, and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of shelling evacuation routes on which the two sides had agreed. Later Sunday, one of the plant's defenders said Russian forces resumed shelling the plant as soon as the evacuation of a group of civilians was completed. Denys Shlega, the commander of the 12th Operational Brigade of Ukraine's National Guard, said in a televised interview Sunday night that several hundred civilians remain trapped alongside nearly 500 wounded soldiers and ""numerous"" dead bodies. ""Several dozen small children are still in the bunkers underneath the plant,"" Shlega said. ""We need one or two more rounds of evacuation."" Sviastoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, which is helping defend the steel plant, told The Associated Press in an interview from Mariupol on Sunday that it has been difficult even to reach some of the wounded inside the plant. ""There's rubble. We have no special equipment. It`s hard for soldiers to pick up slabs weighing tons only with their arms,"" he said. ""We hear voices of people who are still alive"" inside shattered buildings. As many as 100,000 people may still be in blockaded Mariupol, including up to 1,000 civilians hunkered down with an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters beneath the Soviet-era steel plant — the only part of the city not occupied by the Russians. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, is a key target because of its strategic location near the Crimea Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. U.N. humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu said civilians who have been stranded for nearly two months at the plant would receive immediate humanitarian support, including psychological services, once they arrive in Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles (230 kilometers) northwest of Mariupol. Mariupol has seen some of the worst suffering. A maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike in the opening weeks of the war, and about 300 people were reported killed in the bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter. A Doctors Without Borders team was at a reception center for displaced people in Zaporizhzhia, in preparation for the U.N. convoy's arrival. Stress, exhaustion and low food supplies have likely weakened civilians trapped underground at the plant. Ukrainian regiment Deputy Commander Sviatoslav Palamar, meanwhile, called for the evacuation of wounded Ukrainian fighters as well as civilians. ""We don't know why they are not taken away, and their evacuation to the territory controlled by Ukraine is not being discussed,"" he said in a video posted Saturday on the regiment's Telegram channel. Video from inside the steel plant, shared with The Associated Press by two Ukrainian women who said their husbands were among the fighters refusing to surrender there, showed men with blood-stained bandages, open wounds or amputated limbs, including some that appeared gangrenous. The AP could not independently verify the location and date of the video, which the women said was taken last week. Meanwhile, Pelosi and other U.S. lawmakers visited Kyiv on Saturday. She is the most senior American lawmaker to travel to the country since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Her visit came just days after Russia launched rockets at the capital during a visit by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. Rep. Jason Crow, a U.S. Army veteran and a member of the House intelligence and armed services committees, said he came to Ukraine with three areas of focus: ""Weapons, weapons and weapons."" In his nightly televised address Sunday, Zelenskyy said more than 350,000 people had been evacuated from combat zones thanks to humanitarian corridors pre-agreed with Moscow since the start of Russia's invasion. ""The organization of humanitarian corridors is one of the elements of the negotiation process (with Russia), which is ongoing,"" he said. Zelenskyy also accused Moscow of waging ""a war of extermination,"" saying Russian shelling had hit food, grain and fertilizer warehouses, and residential neighborhoods in the Kharkiv, Donbas and other regions. ""What could be Russia's strategic success in this war? Honestly, I do not know. The ruined lives of people and the burned or stolen property will give nothing to Russia,"" he said. In Zaporizhzhia, residents ignored air raid sirens and warnings to shelter at home to visit cemeteries Sunday, when Ukrainians observe the Orthodox Christian day of the dead. ""If our dead could rise and see this, they would say, 'It's not possible, they're worse than the Germans,'"" Hennadiy Bondarenko, 61, said while marking the day with his family at a picnic table among the graves. ""All our dead would join the fighting, including the Cossacks."" Russian forces have embarked on a major military operation to seize significant parts of southern and eastern Ukraine following their failure to capture the capital, Kyiv. Russia's high-stakes offensive has Ukrainian forces fighting village-by-village and more civilians fleeing airstrikes and artillery shelling. Ukrainian intelligence officials accused Russian forces of seizing medical facilities to treat wounded Russian soldiers in several occupied towns, as well as ""destroying medical infrastructure, taking away equipment, and leaving the population without medical care."" Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in eastern Ukraine is difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around. Also, both Ukraine and Moscow-backed rebels have introduced tight restrictions on reporting from the combat zone. But Western military analysts have suggested the offensive was going much slower than planned. So far, Russian troops and separatists appeared to have made only minor gains in the month since Moscow said it would focus its military strength in the east. Hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance has flowed into Ukraine since the war began, but Russia's vast armories mean Ukraine will continue to require huge amounts of support. With plenty of firepower still in reserve, Russia's offensive could intensify and overrun the Ukrainians. Overall the Russian army has an estimated 900,000 active-duty personnel, and a much larger air force and navy. In Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, an explosive device damaged a railway bridge Sunday, and a criminal investigation has been started, the region's government reported in a post on Telegram. Recent weeks have seen a number of fires and explosions in Russian regions near the border, including Kursk. An ammunition depot in the Belgorod region burned after explosions were heard, and authorities in the Voronezh region said an air defense system shot down a drone. An oil storage facility in Bryansk was engulfed by fire a week ago.",47,3.5728255942085907,0.5932596804229648,2.979565913785626,4
2022-05-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/ukraine-mariupol-ceasefire-evacuations-russia-war/,"Even as Mariupol ceasefire enables evacuations from Azovstal steel plant, Russia's war escalates in eastern Ukraine","Bakhmut, Ukraine — The evacuation of civilians who've spent two months holed up in tunnels under a sprawling steelworks in the besieged southeast Ukrainian city of Mariupol resumed on Monday. About 100 of the estimated 1,000 civilians who've been hiding out in the makeshift shelter during weeks of relentless Russian bombardment managed to escape on Sunday, officials said, and the ceasefire enabling those evacuations appeared to be holding. Ukraine's president said more than 100 civilians had been evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant and were due to arrive in Ukraine-controlled Zaporizhzhia on Monday, with more evacuations planned. The civilians have been hiding in the Soviet-era tunnels under the plant along with about 2,000 Ukrainian forces — the last holdouts after Russia's devastating effort to completely capture the strategic port city of Mariupol. ""For the first time, there were two days of real ceasefire on this territory. More than 100 civilians have already been evacuated — women and children first of all,"" said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, they emerged as dazed survivors from beneath the rubble and remains of the pummeled plant. ""I can't believe it,"" said Natalia Usmanova as she stepped into the daylight on Sunday. ""Two months of darkness. We did not see any sunlight. We were so scared."" Families — many with children and even pets — are among those now headed for the relative safety of Ukrainian-held territory. D'Agata says that their rescue, after so many failed attempts, marks a significant achievement for both the United Nations and the Red Cross which spent weeks negotiating the humanitarian ceasefire. It has also raised some hope that lives can be saved in Ukraine, even from besieged cities like Mariupol. But D'Agata says that while the guns fell silent in the port city, fighting has continued to rage along the front-line battlefields of eastern Ukraine. A grinding Russian offensive there has forced the few remaining residents in towns like Lyman to flee. There, D'Agata and his team saw volunteers risking their own lives to save others. Right after the CBS News team left, a Russian airstrike destroyed a railway bridge leading out of the town. It was part of a wider campaign by Russia's military to try to stop more weapons from the U.S. and other Western nations from reaching the Ukrainian forces fighting on the front lines. As the fighting in the eastern Donbas regions escalates, however, there have been further indications that the war President Vladimir Putin started is extending beyond those front lines to Russian soil. Explosions were reported in the Russian border town of Belgorod, where social media video captured a military installation on fire. Russia's forces are also being targeted on the water. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said a new video showed its forces using drones to destroy two high-speed Russian patrol boats in the Black Sea. Ukraine's exhausted soldiers remain outnumbered and outgunned, however, and they can only hope the latest $33 billion worth of promised heavy weapons from America gets to them before the Russian military does.",47,0.7516978672064611,0.8591391351328286,-0.10744126792636743,11

Like other evacuations, success of the mission in Mariupol depended on Russia and its forces, deployed along a long series of checkpoints before reaching Ukrainian ones. Zaporizhzhia, a city about 141 miles northwest of Mariupol, is the destination of the evacuation effort. Zaporizhzhia was the destination of Mariupol residents who managed to flee the city on their own when previous Red Cross- and Ukrainian-organized evacuations had to be called off due to ongoing shelling or concerns about route safety. Zelenskyy tweeted that he planned to visit the city on Monday to greet the evacuees. The ICRC said the convoy to evacuate civilians started on Friday, travelling some 140 miles before reaching the plant in Mariupol on Saturday morning. People who have fled Russian-occupied areas have at times described their vehicles being fired on. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of shelling evacuation routes on which the two sides had agreed.

2022-05-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/switchblade-drone-how-the-kamikaze-anti-tank-weapon-works/,"Switchblade drone: How the ""kamikaze"" anti-tank weapon works","There's new a drone on the battlefield. Only six months old, video of it in action is still secret. Unlike armed drones that carry weapons under the wings, launching them and returning to base, the Switchblade ""kamikaze"" drone carries its own warhead, and blows itself up – taking out tanks, armored vehicles and artillery nests with it. ""It's a one-and-done drone,"" said Wahid Nawabi, who runs Aerovironment, which makes the Switchblade at a secure location he's asked us not to reveal. So far 700 Switchblades – both large and small -- are being sent to Ukraine to be used against the Russians. ""We understand what the people in Ukraine are doing. This is our part to help,"" said John Aldana, the program manager for the Switchblade. He explained to CBS News national security correspondent David Martin why the drone – a missile placed in its launcher with its wings folded – is called the Switchblade: ""It fits inside this tube. At the bottom we have what is known as a gas generator. It pushes the Switchblade out. Once it's clear of the tube, the wings automatically flip out, and it happens very quickly, just like a switchblade."" In the nose are cameras which scan the battlefield, sending video back to an operator controlling the Switchblade from a tablet ""Once it finds the target, the operator has the ability to essentially dive bomb into the target and take out the target,"" said Aldana. ""It's a one-way mission."" Crates containing Switchblades are already being loaded for Ukraine. ""We've been in touch with the Ukrainian military,"" said Nawabi. ""They could use thousands of them. The type of conflict they're engaged with today really is almost ideal for the Switchblade capability."" He's talking specifically about the long Russian convoys creeping toward the front lines. ""Switchblade can just literally take them out like popcorn, literally,"" he said. Martin asked, ""Is the enemy going to hear it?"" ""No. It's very, very quiet,"" said Aldana. ""But if you look up you can see it?"" ""Well, it's not easy, right? I mean, it looks big on a table, but when it's in the sky it's very hard to see."" When asked if a Switchblade can be shot down, Aldana replied, ""As far as I know, it's never happened."" But the signals which control the Switchblade can be jammed, and so far only 100 have reached the battlefield. Still, the weapon has earned Wahid Nawabi a place (along with Vice President Kamala Harris) on the list of Americans whom Russia has sanctioned. It's not his first encounter with the Russians. ""I was born and raised in Afghanistan,"" Nawabi said. ""I left Afghanistan right at the beginning of the occupation of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan back in the early 1980s, so in some respect, this is very emotional and personal for me as well."" At the age of 14, the oldest of four children, he learned what happens when the Russian army invades your country. ""I've been there. I know exactly what it's like. Life changes in a matter of seconds, completely changes upside-down."" And he remembers how one weapon, the American-made Stinger missile, helped chase the Russians out of Afghanistan. ""I vividly remember the Stinger missile,"" he told Martin. ""I saw what it did to the Russian helicopters. Probably have seen a half a dozen of them with my own naked eyes get shot from the sky while watching from the ground."" Now he wants to see Russian tanks destroyed by his Switchblade drones. ""A capability that you cannot hear, you cannot see, you cannot tell where it came from, and boom! All of a sudden it hits you,"" he said. ""Just creates havoc in your mind: 'Oh my God, what is this? What's happening to us?'"" For more info: Story produced by Mary Walsh. Editor: Carol Ross. See also:",49,5.633494507062534,4.76364938006337,0.8698451269991638,24
2022-04-30,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ukraine-russia-forces-fight-offensive-south-east/,Ukrainian forces fight to hold off Russia's offensive in Ukraine's south and east,"Ukraine's forces fought Saturday to hold off a Russian advance in their country's south and east, where the Kremlin is seeking to capture the industrial Donbas region and Western military analysts said Moscow's offensive was going much slower than planned. The United Nations continued trying to broker an evacuation of civilians from the increasingly hellish ruins of Mariupol, a southern port city that Russia has sought to capture since it invaded Ukraine more than nine weeks ago. Citizens are ""begging to get saved"" from a steel mill that has become Mariupol's last defense stronghold, Mayor Vadym Boichenko said Friday. ""There, it's not a matter of days. It's a matter of hours."" An estimated 2,000 fighters were holed up in the plant with about 1,000 civilians. Russian state media outlets reported Saturday that 25 civilians had been evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks, though there was no confirmation from the U.N. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said 19 adults and six children were brought out, but gave no further details. A top official with the Azov Regiment, the Ukrainian unit defending the plant, said 20 civilians were evacuated during a cease-fire, though it was not clear if he was referring to the same group as the Russian news reports. After two months of hellish resistance, video footage showed border guards singing the Ukrainian national anthem, barricaded inside the mill, CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livesay reports. They're propped up by the love of their wives, now refugees in Rome, like Yulya, who has no hope in Russian promises for a safe evacuation. ""They are very bad people,"" she said. ""They lied, and no trust to Russia."" Video and images from inside the plant, shared with The Associated Press, showed unidentified men with stained bandages; others had open wounds or amputated limbs. Local media reports indicated that some of the soldiers still trapped inside the plant are suffering from gangrene. Two Ukrainian women whose husbands are members of the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard said they feared soldiers will be tortured and killed if left behind and captured by the Russians. They asked for a Dunkirk-style mission to evacuate the fighters, a reference to the World War II operation launched to rescue surrounded Allied troops in northern France. ""We can do this extraction operation ... which will save our soldiers, our civilians, our kids,"" Kateryna Prokopenko, 27, told AP. ""We need to do this right now, because people — every hour, every second — are dying."" Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in the east has been difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around. Both Ukraine and the Moscow-backed rebels fighting in the east also have introduced tight restrictions on reporting from the combat zone. Numerically, Russia's military manpower vastly exceeds Ukraine's. In the days before the war began, Western intelligence estimated Russia had positioned near the border as many as 190,000 troops; Ukraine's standing military is about 200,000, spread throughout the country. But so far, Russia's troops and separatist forces appeared to have made only minor gains in the Donbas in the month since Moscow said it would focus its military strength in eastern Ukraine. In part because of the tenacity of the Ukrainian resistance, the U.S. believes the Russians are ""at least several days behind where they wanted to be"" as they try to encircle Ukrainian troops in the east, said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the American military's assessment. The British Defense Ministry offered a similar assessment in its daily assessment of the war, saying it believes Russian forces in Ukraine are likely suffering from ""weakened morale,"" along with a lack of unit-level skills and ""inconsistent air support."" It did not say on what basis it made the evaluation. Despite the village-by-village nature of the fight to gain ground in the Donbas, Russia's promised offensive still could materialize. Overall, the Russian army has an estimated 900,000 active-duty personnel. Russia also has a much larger air force and navy than Ukraine and possesses tactical nuclear weapons. In Mariupol, around 100,000 people were believed to still be in the city with little food, water or medicine. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said the organization was negotiating with authorities in Moscow and Kyiv to create the conditions for safe passage. Ukraine has blamed the failure of numerous previous evacuation attempts on continued Russian shelling. For those who are in the Soviet-era Azovstal steel plant, a vast underground network of tunnels and bunkers has provided safety from airstrikes. But the situation has grown more dire after the Russians dropped ""bunker busters"" and other bombs on the plant, the mayor said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV that the real problem is that ""humanitarian corridors are being ignored by Ukrainian ultra-nationals."" Moscow has repeatedly claimed right-wing Ukrainians were thwarting evacuation efforts and using civilians as human shields. The claims have not been verified. The Azov Regiment helping to defend the steel plant has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed in 2014 by far-right activists at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. In further comments published Saturday by Xinhua, Lavrov said Russia has evacuated over 1 million people from Ukraine since the war began, including more than 300 Chinese civilians. The foreign minister offered no evidence to support his claim in the interview. Ukraine has accused Moscow of forcefully sending Ukrainians out of the country. Lavrov also partly blamed the lack of progress in discussions to end the war on ""the bellicose rhetoric and inflammatory actions of Western supporters of the Kyiv regime."" Russian state TV nightly features guests suggesting Moscow use nuclear weapons in the conflict. Russia also recently unveiled a new nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile. Marko Suprun, an expert on Russian propaganda, told CBS News' Chris Livesay that the treat of using nuclear weapons is a psychological ploy meant to keep the U.S. and other allies from aiding Ukraine. ""Letting Russia decide whether or not you're going to arm Ukraine because they have nuclear weapons, that's already a win of Russian disinformation, because you've convinced them of your greatness,"" Suprun said. In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of trying to destroy the Donbas and all who live there. The constant attacks ""show that Russia wants to empty this territory of all people,"" he said. ""If the Russian invaders are able to realize their plans even partially, then they have enough artillery and aircraft to turn the entire Donbas into stones, as they did with Mariupol,"" Zelenskyy said. In a neighborhood on the outskirts of Kharkiv that is regularly shelled by Russian forces, some residents remained in their apartments even though the buildings have charred gaping holes. There is no running water or electricity, so they gather outside to cook on an open flame. Ukrainian reservists staying in a neighborhood cellar said the Russians have hit the buildings with rockets, artillery and tank fire. ""A tank can come at a short distance and fire all of its ammunition on residential areas. It doesn't care where. And it's impossible to figure out where it will fire,"" said Vladislav, who like others in the unit would only give his first name. Another reservist, who goes by the nickname Malysh, expressed frustration that he wasn't able to do more to stop the Russian advance. ""I took up arms, but unfortunately I can't catch flying missiles with my bare hands and throw them back,"" he said. In the nearby village of Ruska Lozava, hundreds of people were evacuated after Ukrainian forces retook the city from Russian occupiers, according to the regional governor. Those who fled to Kharkiv spoke of dire conditions under the Russians, with little water or food and no electricity. ""We were hiding in the basement. It was horror. The basement was shaking from the explosions. We were screaming, we were crying and we were praying to God,"" resident Ludmila Bocharnikova said.",47,2.996306304613087,1.9497272352640524,1.0465790693490344,19
2022-04-29,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-zelenskyy-kyiv-attack-guterres/,Zelenskyy denounces Russian attack on Kyiv during U.N. chief's visit,"Kyiv, Ukraine — Ukraine's leader accused Russia of trying to humiliate the United Nations by raining missiles on Kyiv during a visit by Secretary-General António Guterres, an attack that shattered the capital's tentative return to normality as the focus of the war moved east. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine's forces were holding off Russia's attempted advance in the south and east, as efforts continued to secure safe passage for residents of the key coastal city of Mariupol, which has been largely reduced to rubble in a 2-month-long siege. Hundreds of soldiers and civilians, many of them wounded, continue to resist bombardment inside a steel mill in Mariupol, CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay reports. Russia pounded targets all over Ukraine on Thursday, including the attack on Kyiv that struck a residential high-rise and another building. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday that one body was found in the rubble of the attack. Ten people were wounded, including at least one who lost a leg, according to Ukraine's emergency services. Moscow said it used ""high-precision, long-range air-based weapons"" in the attack, according to Agence France-Presse. In an apparent reference to the same strike, Russia's Defense Ministry said Friday that it had destroyed ""production buildings"" at the Artem defense factory in Kyiv. U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty said Friday that one of its producers, Vera Gyrych, was killed when a Russian missile hit her house during Thursday's attack on Kyiv, AFP reports. The boldest Russian bombardment of the capital since Moscow's forces retreated weeks ago came barely an hour after Zelenskyy held a news conference with Guterres, who toured some of the destruction in and around Kyiv and condemned attacks on civilians. ""This says a lot about Russia's true attitude towards global institutions, about attempts of Russian authorities to humiliate the U.N. and everything that the organization represents,"" Zelenskyy said in an overnight video address to the nation. ""Therefore, it requires corresponding powerful reaction."" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko derided the attack as equivalent to Russian President Vladimir Putin showing Guterres ""his middle finger."" Meanwhile, AFP says the president of the host nation of this fall's G20 summit, Indonesia's Joko Widodo, said Friday he'd invited Zelenskyy to attend, confirming earlier word from Zelenskyy along those lines. It was unclear whether he would. Widodo said Russian President Vladimir Putin has confirmed that he'll be there. Russia is a G20 member. Ukraine isn't. One aim of Guterres' visit to Kyiv was to secure the evacuation of people from the ruined southern port city of Mariupol, including a shattered steelworks where Ukrainian defenders are holed up and hundreds of civilians are also sheltering, It was unclear whether it had borne fruit. Previous evacuation attempts have collapsed. But Zelenskyy's office said plans were in place yet again for an evacuation of civilians from the plant Friday, AFP reports. Mariupol has seen some of the most dramatic suffering of the war. Under siege since the early days of the invasion, many of its residents became trapped with scarce access to food, water, medicine or electricity. An estimated 100,000 people are believed to still be in the city, and the city council warned Thursday that a lack of safe drinking water or a working sewer system could lead to outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and dysentery. It added that bodies were decaying under the rubble. Russian forces largely control the city, but some 2,000 Ukrainian fighters are holed up at the steel plant, the last known pocket of resistance. About 1,000 civilians are with them, and the fighters said recent concentrated bombings killed and wounded people. Video posted online by Ukraine's Azov Regiment inside the steel plant showed people combing through the rubble to remove the dead and help the wounded. The regiment said the Russians hit an improvised underground hospital and its operating room, killing an unspecified number of people. The video couldn't be independently verified. The governor of Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said two towns there were hit by Russian Grad rockets on Friday. There was no immediate word on casualties or damage. Separately, the governor of Russia's Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said a border post came under mortar fire from Ukraine and that Russian border forces returned fire. He said there were no casualties on the Russian side. That came a day after explosions were reported across the country - in Polonne in the west, Chernihiv in the north near the border with Belarus, and Fastiv, a large railway hub southwest of the capital. The mayor of Odesa, in southern Ukraine, said rockets were intercepted by air defenses. Ukrainian authorities also reported intense Russian fire in the Donbas - the eastern industrial heartland that the Kremlin says is its main objective - and near Kharkiv, a northeastern city outside the Donbas that is seen as key to the offensive. In Kyiv, explosions shook the city and flames poured out the windows of the residential high-rise and another building. The capital had been relatively unscathed in recent weeks since Moscow refocused its efforts on seizing all of the Donbas. The explosions in northwestern Kyiv's Shevchenkivsky district came as residents have been increasingly returning to the city. Cafes and other businesses have reopened, and a growing numbers of people have been out and about, enjoying the spring weather. On his visit to Ukraine, Guterres surveyed the destruction in small towns outside the capital that saw some of the worst horrors of the first onslaught of the war. He condemned the atrocities committed in towns like Bucha, where evidence of mass killings of civilians was found after Russia withdrew in early April in the face of unexpectedly stiff resistance. ""Wherever there is a war, the highest price is paid by civilians,"" the U.N. chief lamented. On Friday, the secretary general's spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, spoke with Mola Lenghi and Michelle Miller from Rzeszow, Poland. Dujarric said that Guterres' meeting with Zelenskyy in Kyiv lasted an hour and a half and he told the president that the U.N. was scaling up humanitarian aid and they also discussed how to get a civilians out of the steel plant in Mariupol. ""We have condemned and will continue to condemn these missile strikes on what is or apparently is pretty clearly, civilian infrastructure,"" Dujarric said. On the meeting of Guterres with Putin earlier in the week, Dujarric said, ""There was a agreement in principle from the Russian Federation, that the U.N. would work with the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Russia and Ukraine"" to evacuate civilians from the steel plant. ""But let's be clear, a meeting is not going to end with this conflict, meetings are not ending this conflict. What will end this conflict is when Russia decides to end this conflict,"" he said. ""What we saw firsthand yesterday was the devastation, the heartbreaking devastation of just a few villages around Kyiv.""

2022-04-29,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-behind-goal/,"Russians are several days behind their goal in Ukraine, Pentagon assesses","The Pentagon assesses that Russian forces are several days behind where they wanted to be at this point in eastern Ukraine, according to a senior defense official. The Russians expected to be farther along in their goal to trap Ukrainian troops in the east and thought this would be accomplished by now, according to Pentagon assessments. They are ""nowhere close"" to their goal of totally encircling Ukrainian forces, the official said. Russian forces have been making slow, uneven and incremental progress in east and south Ukraine, according to the official, in part, because they're wary of outrunning supply lines, as they did in northern Ukraine at the start of the invasion and also because of the effectiveness of Ukrainian resistance. ""They're not moving very fast,"" the official said. ""A few kilometers a day is about the most they can handle."" The Russians have now committed 92 battalion tactical groups, generally made up of 800 to 1,000 troops, to the fight in Ukraine. The official warned that though the Russians have a numeric advantage over the Ukrianians, the fighting in the Donbas could be a long slog, since both sides know the terrain and both sides are utilizing long-range artillery in the fight. In the east, the Russians are focusing on moving out from Izyum along three main axes - southwest towards Dobropillya, slightly southeast towards Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, and farther southeast toward Lyman. The Russians are also trying to push toward Lyman from an eastern town they control, Kremmina. About a dozen Russian battalion tactical groups have been in and around Mariupol, but some of them have started this week to move north towards the Zaporizhzhia oblast. The Russians continue to strike Mariupol from the air, which indicates they don't control the city yet. The Russians have been conducting limited offensives in the east at the same time they're conducting what the Pentagon calls ""shaping operations"" to prepare for a larger offensive. Russia initially invaded Ukraine on a number of axes and have now focused on the smaller geographic area of the Donbas where Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting Russian-backed separatists since 2014. With the shift to the east, the U.S. and NATO allies have started giving Ukraine heavier weapons like artillery in advance of an expected prolonged battle. So far, more than 60% of the 90 U.S. provided howitzers have made it into Ukrainian hands, according to the Pentagon. Once weapons enter Ukraine, the U.S. does not track them, so it is unclear if the howitzer artillery pieces have made it to the frontlines in the Donbas region yet. The howitzers are new to the Ukrainian armed forces and require some training. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced Friday that some Ukrainians are receiving training on the howitzers and other systems at U.S. military installations in Germany. One hundred-sixty members of the Florida National Guard had been training Ukrainian soldiers in Ukraine before leaving in early February ahead of the invasion, and now, they are conducting most of the training on the systems, according to Kirby. All of the training is taking place outside of Ukraine. There were emotional moments between the guardsmen and some of the Ukrainian soldiers during their recent reunion because of the bonds formed before the invasion, Kirby said. The artillery pieces and other equipment announced in recent assistance packages are geared to what the Ukrainians have requested, in anticipation of an intense battle in the east.",7,4.803668207737742,5.7339371632089176,-0.9302689554711758,19

The board will focus on disinformation coming from Russia as well as misleading messages about the U.S.-Mexico border, the Associated Press reports. The immediate focus will be on misinformation from human smugglers, who spread false claims about U.S. border policy to migrants to help drum up business. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing Thursday that the board will tackle misinformation on a range of issues, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said part of its intention is to counter misinformation in Hispanic communities especially. In a statement to CBS News, a DHS spokesperson said the department began its work on disinformation several years ago. ""The Department has created the Disinformation Governance Board to ensure this work does not infringe on the fundamental right of free speech and to further protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties,"" the spokesperson said. ""To provide this protection, the Board will coordinate the Department's internal activities related to disinformation that poses a threat to homeland security."" Disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz will lead the board. Jankowicz, who has researched Russian misinformation tactics and online harassment, is author of the book ""How To Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict."" She has also advised the Ukrainian government on strategic communications, according to the Wilson Center think-tank, where she served as a global fellow. Asked about the initiative, Psaki said ""it sounds like the objective of the board is to prevent disinformation and misinformation from traveling around the country in a range of communities,"" adding, ""I'm not sure who opposes that effort."" But Republicans made it clear they have objections. Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio who is the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, criticized DHS's creation of the board. ""As the author of the bipartisan law that established the Global Engagement Center to combat the constantly evolving threat of foreign propaganda and disinformation abroad, I do not believe that the United States government should turn the tools that we have used to assist our allies counter foreign adversaries onto the American people,"" he said in a statement on Thursday. ""Our focus should be on bad actors like Russia and China, not our own citizens,"" he said, adding that he looks forward to pressing Secretary Mayorkas for answers when he appears before the committee next week. CBS News has reached out to Senator Gary C. Peters, the Democratic chairman of the committee, as well as DHS for more information and is awaiting response. Earlier this month, FBI Director Christopher Wray spoke to ""60 Minutes"" about disinformation and other threats from Russian as the war in Ukraine rages on. ""The Russians engage in… very active disinformation, misinformation, and in fact information warfare as a key part of their arsenal,"" Wray told CBS News' Scott Pelley. Recent disinformation from Russia includes the false claim last month that American National Guard troops were killed fighting in Ukraine. In a statement, the Guard said not only was the report ""false,"" but that the soldiers named in the report were not even in Ukraine. Misinformation on a number of other issues — from COVID-19 to the election — quickly spreads on social media. The heads of several large tech companies, including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, have testified before Congress about their efforts to try to address it. Blasting the problem of COVID-19 misinformation last summer, President Biden said, ""Anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It's killing people. It's bad information. My hope is that Facebook, instead of taking it personally that somehow I'm saying Facebook is killing people, that they would do something about the misinformation. The outrageous misinformation about the vaccine.""",20,6.664832409187146,4.336596338911967,2.328236070275179,29

During a news conference in Williston where Gov. DeSantis pledged 22-million-dollars to improve infrastructure, he referred to the proposed bureau as a ""belated April Fool's Joke."" ""They now have an idea and I just thought this was just a belated April Fool's joke. But they're actually going to create in the Department of Homeland Security a Bureau of Disinformation."" DeSantis said the effort really amounts to a war against dissent.

The board will be led by disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz, who has researched Russian misinformation tactics and online harassment. The board will monitor and prepare for Russian disinformation threats as this year's midterm elections near. DeSantis called Jankowicz an ""advocate for COVID lockdowns who herself has put out disinformation about the Hunter Biden tapes, who supported Russian collusion conspiracy theories.""

At least one person was killed and several were injured in the attack on Kyiv, including some who were trapped in the rubble when two buildings were hit, rescue officials said. The bombardment came barely an hour after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a news conference with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who said Ukraine has become ""an epicenter of unbearable heartache and pain."" A spokesperson said Guterres and his team were safe. One of several Russian missiles that hit Kyiv struck near the hotel where the U.N. chief is staying, the secretary-general's spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, told CBS News correspondent Pamela Falk, although the U.N. delegation was meeting with the prime minister in his office and were not in the hotel at the time. ""I was shocked to be informed that two rockets have exploded in the city where I am,"" Gutteres was quoted as telling the BBC. ""So this is a dramatic war, and we absolutely need to end this war and we absolutely need to have a solution for this war."" Ukraine's defense minister said in a tweet, ""This is an attack on the security of the Secretary General and on world security!"" Guterres' visit came two days after he met one-on-one with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Meanwhile, explosions were reported across the country, in Polonne in the west, Chernihiv near the border with Belarus, and Fastiv, a large railway hub southwest of the capital. The mayor of Odesa in southern Ukraine said rockets were intercepted by air defenses. Ukrainian authorities also reported intense Russian fire in the Donbas — the eastern industrial heartland that the Kremlin says is its main objective — and near Kharkiv, a northeastern city outside the Donbas that is seen as key to the offensive. In the ruined southern port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian fighters holed up in the steel plant that represents the last pocket of resistance said concentrated bombing overnight killed and wounded more people. And authorities warned that a lack of safe drinking water inside the city could lead to outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and dysentery. In Zaporizhzhia, a crucial way station for tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Mariupol, an 11-year-old boy was among at least three people wounded in a rocket attack that authorities said was the first to hit a residential area in the southern city since the war began. Shards of glass cut the boy's leg to the bone. Vadym Vodostoyev, the boy's father, said: ""It just takes one second and you're left with nothing."" The fresh attacks came as Guterres surveyed the destruction in small towns outside the capital that saw some of the worst horrors of the first onslaught of the war. He condemned the atrocities committed in towns like Bucha, where evidence of mass killings of civilians was found after Russia withdrew in early April in the face of unexpectedly stiff resistance. ""Wherever there is a war, the highest price is paid by civilians,"" the U.N. chief lamented. After visiting the town of Borodianka, he told local press, ""The war is an absurdity in the 21st century. The war is evil. And when one sees these situations our heart, of course, stays with the victims."" Separately, Ukraine's prosecutor accused 10 Russian soldiers of being ""involved in the torture of peaceful people"" in Bucha. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova did not say her office had filed criminal charges, and she appealed to the public for help in gathering evidence. Russia denies it targets civilians. In the attack on Kyiv, explosions shook the city and flames poured out of windows in at least two buildings — including one residential one — in the capital, which has been relatively unscathed in recent weeks. Plumes of smoke could be seen over the city. The explosions in northwest Kyiv's Shevchenkivsky district came as residents have been increasingly returning to the city. Cafes and other businesses have reopened, and a growing numbers of people have been out and about, enjoying the spring weather. Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in the east has been difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around. Several journalists have been killed in the war, now in its third month. Also, both Ukraine and the Moscow-backed rebels fighting in the east have introduced tight restrictions on reporting from the combat zone. Western officials say the Kremlin's apparent goal is to take the Donbas by encircling and crushing Ukrainian forces from the north, south and east. But so far, Russia's troops and their allied separatist forces appear to have made only minor gains, taking several small towns as they try to advance in relatively small groups against staunch Ukrainian resistance. Russian military units were mauled in the abortive bid to storm Kyiv and had to regroup and refit. Some analysts say the delay in launching a full-fledged offensive may reflect a decision by Putin to wait until his forces are ready for a decisive battle, instead of rushing in and risking another failure that could shake his rule amid worsening economic conditions at home because of Western sanctions. Many observers suspect Putin wants to be able to claim a big victory in the east by Victory Day, on May 9, one of the proudest holidays on the Russian calendar, marking the defeat of Nazi Germany during World War II. As Russia presses its offensive, civilians again bear the brunt. ""It's not just scary. It's when your stomach contracts from pain,"" said Kharkiv resident Tatiana Pirogova. ""When they shoot during the day, it's still OK, but when the evening comes, I can't describe how scary it is."" Ukraine's military said that Russian troops were subjecting several places in the Donbas to ""intense fire"" and that over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian forces had repelled six attacks in the region. Four civilians were killed in heavy shelling of residential areas in the Luhansk region of the Donbas, according to the regional governor. Columns of smoke could be seen rising at different points across the Donetsk region of the Donbas, and artillery and sirens were heard on and off. In Mariupol, video posted online by Ukraine's Azov Regiment inside the steel plant showed people combing through the rubble to remove the dead and help the wounded. The regiment said the Russians hit an improvised underground hospital and its surgery room, killing an unspecified number of people. The video couldn't be independently verified. An estimated 100,000 people remained trapped in Mariupol. ""Deadly epidemics may break out in the city due to the lack of centralized water supply and sewers,"" the city council said on the messaging app Telegram. It reported bodies decaying under the rubble and a ""catastrophic"" shortage of drinking water and food. Loud bangs were also reported in Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, but there was no immediate explanation. In recent days, fuel and ammunition sites on Russian soil have been hit with explosions and fires, and suspicion has fallen on Ukraine.

2022-04-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-offensive-in-east/,"Russia is stepping up its offensive in the east, Ukraine says","Ukraine said Thursday that Russia's offensive in the east picked up momentum, with several towns coming under intense attack as Moscow's forces attempt to surround Ukrainian troops. In a reminder of the horrific toll the war has taken since it began Feb. 24, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres visited towns outside the capital of Kyiv, including Bucha, where evidence of mass killings of civilians was found after Russia's retreat from the area. ""Ukraine is an epicenter of unbearable heartache and pain,"" Guterres told reporters in Kyiv, alongside Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Guterres' visit came two days after he met one-on-one with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Russia suddenly cut off natural gas to two NATO nations, Poland and Bulgaria, on Wednesday, in what was seen as a bid to punish and divide the West over its support for Ukraine ahead of the potentially pivotal battle in the eastern industrial region of the Donbas. The General Staff of Ukraine's military said Russian forces were ""exerting intense fire"" in several places as they pushed on with the second phase of their invasion. The most intense action was around Donetsk and close to Kharkiv, which lies outside the Donbas but is seen as key to Russia's apparent bid to encircle Ukrainian troops there. The General Staff said that over the past 24 hours, the Ukrainian forces have repelled six attacks in the Donbas, control of which is now Moscow's primary focus ever since its initial offensive faltered and failed to take the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian Special Forces Battalion Commander Ihor Lapin told CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata, who's on the front lines in eastern Ukraine, his troops simply don't have the firepower to match Russia. The need for more high-caliber ammunition is urgent, he said, adding that the fighting's been so intense, the Russians launched 1500 mortars on a single position in a single day. Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said the Russian army shelled the residential area in his region ""29 times by aircrafts, multiple rocket launches, tube artillery and mortars."" Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press also showed evidence of intense Russian fire on Mariupol in recent days. The images show how concentrated attacks have greatly damaged a central facility at the Azovstal steelworks, the last holdout of Ukrainian fighters in the key battleground port city. An estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters in the steelworks, a massive Soviet-era complex with complex underground facilities built to withstand airstrikes. Russia, meanwhile, said a city under its control in the south also came under fire. With the war now in its third month, Guterres on Thursday toured towns outside Kyiv that have seen some of the most horrific attacks of the war. ""Civilians always pay the highest price,"" he said as he visited the bombed out suburb of Irpin. ""And this is something everyone should remember, everywhere in the world. Wherever there is a war the highest price is paid by civilians."" After visiting the town of Borodianka, he told local press, ""The war is an absurdity in the 21st century. The war is evil. And when one sees these situations our heart, of course, stays with the victims."" Evidence of atrocities was discovered in the towns after the Russians retreated from the area in the face a fiercer than expected Ukrainian resistance, bolstered by Western arms. Guterres spoke of ""the senseless loss of life, the massive destruction, the unacceptable violations of human rights and the laws of war."" ""I am here to focus on ways on how the U.N. can expand support for the people of Ukraine, saving lives, reduce suffering and help find the path of peace,"" he said. ""I want the Ukrainian people to know that the world sees you, hears you, and is in awe of your resilience and resolve."" He pledged to increase U.N. efforts to provide ""life-saving humanitarian aid"" to millions of civilians inside Ukraine. ""This war must end, and peace must established in line the charter of the United Nations and international law. Many leaders have made many good efforts to stop the fighting, though these efforts, so far, have not succeeded."" In what could be a further Ukrainian counterattack, a series of explosions boomed near the television tower late Wednesday in southern Ukraine's Kherson, which has been occupied by Russian forces since early in the war. The blasts at least temporarily knocked Russian channels off the air, Ukrainian and Russian news organizations reported. Ukraine has urged its allies to send even more military equipment so it can continue its fight. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that ""to date, NATO allies have pledged and provided at least 8 billion U.S. dollars in military support to Ukraine. And we see the importance of further stepping up our support to Ukraine."" He also said Finland and Sweden would be embraced with open arms should they decide to join the 30-nation military organization and could become members quite quickly. While Russia's initial blitz was stunted — and it suffered the humiliating loss of a massive warship — Britain's Defense Ministry said the Russian navy still has the ability to strike coastal targets in Ukraine. In an intelligence briefing posted Thursday morning, the ministry says that about 20 Russia naval vessels, including submarines, are currently operating the Black Sea zone. But the ministry says Russia isn't able to replace the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, which sank earlier this month in the Black Sea, because the Bosporus Strait remains closed to all non-Turkish warships. Russia also lost the landing ship Saratov, which was destroyed by explosions and fire on March 24. While it presses its campaign in the east, Moscow has also piled on the pressure by leveraging its biggest export product, energy, cutting off NATO members Poland and Bulgaria from its natural gas on Wednesday. European leaders blasted that decision as ""blackmail,"" saying the move and the Kremlin's warning that it might cease shipments to other countries is a failed attempt to divide the West over its support for Ukraine. The tactic against the two EU countries could eventually force targeted nations to ration gas and deal another blow to economies suffering from rising prices. At the same time, it could deprive Russia of badly needed income to fund its war effort. The gas cuts do not immediately put the two countries in any dire trouble. Poland, especially, has been working for many years to line up other suppliers, and the continent is heading into summer, making gas less essential for households. Still, the cutoff and the Kremlin warning that other countries could be next sent shivers of worry through the 27-nation European Union. Germany is the world's biggest buyer of Russian energy, and Italy is also a significant consumer, though they, too, have been taking steps to reduce their dependence on Moscow. An independent research group said Thursday that Germany was the biggest buyer of Russian energy during the first two months of the war in Ukraine. The study published by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air calculates that Moscow Russia has earned 63 billion euros ($66.5 billion) from fossil fuel exports since Feb. 24, the date Russian troops attacked Ukraine.

2022-04-27,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-gas-blackmail-nuclear-threat-chernobyl/,"Ukraine says Russia resorting to ""gas blackmail"" and threat of nuclear disaster as heaving fighting rages","Kyiv — Heavy fighting continued overnight in the south and east of Ukraine. In the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said Russia had hit a sprawling steelworks plant with 35 airstrikes in just 24 hours. An estimated 2,000 Ukrainian forces are holed up at the Azovstal plant, along with about 1,000 civilians taking shelter there. CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay has been talking with people caught up in the violence, and as he reports, energy is being used as a weapon in this war. Russia's state-run energy firm Gazprom said Wednesday that it had cut off the gas supply to Poland and Bulgaria because they were refusing to pay in Russian rubles. Ukraine called it the start of Russian ""gas blackmail"" aimed at its European allies. NATO member Poland agreed, with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki calling the gas cutoff ""a direct attack"" on his country and vowing that it would not give in to ""this blackmail."" Livesay said Mariupol was still standing on Thursday, with Ukrainian fighters there holding out against Russia's overwhelming firepower. Elsewhere in the east, however, Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had managed to capture several villages in the Donbas region that has become the focus of the invasion — but not the only front. As Ukraine fiercely fights back in the south and east, Livesay said a new front may be opening further west, directly south of Ukraine's capital along the country's border with Moldova. For two days, mysterious explosions have rung out in Transnistria, a pro-Russian breakaway region of Moldova where Russia has based some of its own forces. Moldova, without naming names, has said the blasts were aimed at creating ""pretexts for straining the security situation."" The worrying development comes as the global security situation grows increasingly fragile, with Russia repeatedly firing missiles right over Ukraine's nuclear power plants. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy, saying Russia's actions had left him ""speechless,"" accused Vladimir Putin on Tuesday of threatening to turn nuclear power into a weapon. He said it on the anniversary of the Chernobyl explosion that shot a fireball high into Ukraine's sky 36 years ago. Amid the threat of Russian shelling, no light was allowed, save for some candles lit to honor the dead in the nearby town of Slavutych, which was built from scratch for the evacuees of that nuclear disaster. But Slavutych's current Mayor Yuri Fomichov told Livesay that Russia's current invasion was ""even more traumatic than the worst nuclear disaster in history."" When a Russian tank battalion occupied the Chernobyl plant, risking yet another catastrophe before retreating after a month, Fomichov himself was taken hostage. Enraged citizens rose up, waving Ukrainian flags and standing defiant before the occupiers. Soldiers fired warning shots and stun grenades, but the residents refused to disperse until their mayor was freed and their town was liberated. Many of them are now survivors of not one, but two historic tragedies in Ukraine. Resident Alexey told CBS News he was among those who witnessed both Chernobyl's reactor, and this war explode before him. ""We never expected either of them,"" he told Livesay. ""Chernobyl 36 years ago, or Russia attacking its brothers today. I can't wrap my head around it."" All they can do is remember those lost in one nuclear disaster, and hope not to bear witness to another.",47,2.9331918176095897,3.057745284823808,-0.12455346721421812,23
2022-04-27,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/germany-ukraine-heavy-weapons-anti-aircraft-tanks-russia-war/,Why Germany has abandoned its post-WWII stance to give Ukraine heavy weapons — and what those weapons are,"Berlin — After weeks resisting calls from Ukraine, the U.S. and from within his own country to send heavy weapons to help Ukrainian forces repel Russia's invasion, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has agreed to supply some serious armament. The government announced Tuesday that Germany would deliver 50 Flakpanzer Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine. The announcement came during a summit of Western nations hosted by U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at the U.S.'s Ramstein Air Base in southwest Germany. It came after Austin appealed to America's closest military allies to ""keep moving heaven and earth"" to help Ukraine defend itself. Germany's decision marked the end of a cross-party commitment not to supply weapons to active conflict zones that had held in Berlin since the end of World War II. In addition to pressure from the U.S., Scholz's coalition government was convinced to abandon that policy by Ukraine's ambassador in Berlin, and by the fact that several smaller European nations have been sending heavy weapons to Ukraine for weeks. ""The international pressure was growing too big, Germany had to give in,"" Gustav Gressel, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), told CBS News on Wednesday. The German government has now granted permission to arms manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann to provide the anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine. The weapons are built on German Leopard I tank hulls and mounted with twin autocannon. Each ""Cheetah,"" as the tanks are commonly known, boasts 320 anti-aircraft rounds. The 50 for Ukraine will be drawn from former stocks of the Bundeswehr, Germany's military. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced the new contribution to Ukraine's war effort at the very the start of the meeting of defense chiefs at Ramstein on Tuesday. ""This is exactly what Ukraine needs right now to secure its airspace from the ground,"" she said. ""As soon as it was clear that others were delivering certain systems, then we were clear that we would support that by providing our own shipments. That is our way of doing things — i.e., Germany will not do it alone."" The Gepard tanks, often called ""Cheetahs,"" can operate autonomously in all weather conditions, day or night. The current version could be used to shoot down modern fighter aircraft, standard missiles, remotely guided missiles and drones, the manufacturer says. The weapons were originally developed about half a century ago to provide mobile Bundeswehr tank units with protection against low-flying aircraft and attack helicopters. The Bundeswehr decommissioned the tank about 10 years ago, but the system is still used by NATO member Romania's military. Gressel, of the ECFR, said Germany wasn't spurred into action this week based solely on Ukraine's short-term needs. ""Russia's war aims are very long-term, and the war will still occupy us for a very long time, even after this [invasion]. So in that sense, the question is what to deliver, how, in what time,"" he said. ""There is a long-term interest to supply Ukraine with weapons."" And there could be more coming. In the run-up to the meeting at Ramstein, Düsseldorf-based arms manufacturer Rheinmetall also applied for permission to deliver heavy weapons to Ukraine. According to German news agency DPA, the company submitted applications to the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology last week to supply 88 used Leopard main battle tanks to Ukraine, in addition to infantry fighting vehicles. It wasn't clear how likely the German government is to grant those requests, but if it does okay the provision of battle tanks, it would be the heaviest offensive weaponry provided to Ukraine to date. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said decisions would be made on the applications as quickly as possible. Germany also wants to support the Netherlands and the U.S. in training Ukrainian soldiers in the use of artillery systems, including by bringing Ukrainian forces into Germany for lessons. Austin welcomed Germany's decision on Tuesday, hailing the country as a ""great friend and ally to the U.S."" ""We must keep up with the pace of war in"" Ukraine, he said. ""We are all more determined than ever to support Ukraine in fighting Russian aggression and Russian brutality."" He said he believed that with the right equipment Ukraine could beat Russia. Earlier, Austin said the U.S. wanted ""to see Russia weakened to the point where it can't do things like invade Ukraine.""",49,3.5730695076761654,3.5833371939641347,-0.010267686287969369,22
2022-04-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-prime-minister-denys-shmyhal-face-the-nation/,"Ukrainian prime minister says Russia committing ""terrible war crimes"" in Mariupol","As the death toll mounts in Mariupol — the key port city in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has focused its efforts since failing to capture the capital of Kyiv — Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal accused the invading forces of committing ""terrible war crimes"" in the city. In an exclusive interview on ""Face the Nation,"" Shmyhal said ""small children and babies"" have died of dehydration in Mariupol since the war began two months ago. More than 100,000 people are believed to remain in the city with little access to water, food or heat. About 430,000 people lived in the city before the war. ""So there are terrible atrocities, terrible war crimes on the Mariupol territory,"" Shmyhal said at the end of his trip last week to Washington, where he met with President Biden and top lawmakers. Ukrainian officials estimate that more than 20,000 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine in February. After failing to capture the capital city of Kyiv, Russian forces have shifted their focus to Mariupol and other strategic towns and cities in the east and south of the country. On the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russia launched new attacks in the region, including in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, where Ukrainian officials said Russian missile strikes killed a 3-month-old baby and at least five other people. Shmyhal said Mariupol is like a ""symbol of brave Ukrainian soldiers and civilians"" who have tried to protect the city amid heavy Russian bombardment. But the only part of the city that remains under Ukrainian control is a steel plant where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering with some 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. ""We will protect our cities. And Mariupol will stay till the end,"" Shmyhal said, adding that Ukrainian soldiers would fight as long as it takes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin were heading to Kyiv on Sunday to meet with Ukraine's leaders. Shmyhal told ""Face the Nation"" that it would be a ""very important political symbol"" to have U.S. officials visit Ukraine so they can see with ""their own eyes what's happened, which atrocities and war crimes"" Russia has allegedly carried out. The prime minister said he was grateful for the support the U.S. and other Western nations have provided Ukraine, but he said his country needs more weapons, ammunition and financial assistance, and urged the West to impose additional sanctions on Russia. He also suggested using seized Russian assets, including yachts, to pay for the estimated $600 billion it would take to rebuild Ukraine. ""All of this should be paid by Russia. Absolutely,"" Shmyhal said.",47,3.474744367104414,3.918910802451223,-0.44416643534680933,19
2022-04-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-mariupol-steel-plant-zelenskyy-blinken-austin/,Zelenskyy pushes visiting U.S. officials for more aid to Ukraine,"Kyiv, Ukraine — The U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country's capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia's invasion, according to Zelenskyy's adviser. ""Yes, they're meeting with the president. Let's hope something will be decided on further help,"" presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV of the meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. It came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia's campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow's forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol. Before the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees. ""You can't come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,″ he said. The visit would be the first by senior U.S. officials since Russia invaded Ukraine 60 days ago. Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil in March to meet with the country's foreign minister during a visit to Poland. Zelenskyy's last face-to-face meeting with a U.S. leader was February 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris. While the West has funneled military equipment to Ukraine, Zelenskyy has stressed repeatedly it needs more heavy weapons, including long-range air defense systems, as well as warplanes. In an apparent boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron won reelection over far right candidate Marine Le Pen. The result was hailed by France's allies in the European Union as a reassuring sign of stability and continued support for Ukraine. France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons systems to Ukraine. Zelenskyy's meeting with U.S. officials was set to take place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter, when the faithful celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. Speaking from Kyiv's ancient St. Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, highlighted its significance to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war. ""The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!"" he said. Still, the war cast a shadow over celebrations. Residents of rural villages battered by the war approached the day with some cautious defiance. ""How do I feel? Very nervous. Everyone is nervous,"" Olena Koptyl said as she prepared her Easter bread in the northern village of Ivanivka, where Russian tanks still littered the roads. ""The Easter holiday doesn't bring any joy. I'm crying a lot. We cannot forget how we lived."" Earlier, during his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy claimed that intercepted communications recorded Russian troops discussing ""how they conceal the traces of their crimes"" in Mariupol. The president also highlighted the death of a 3-month old girl in a Russian missile strike Saturday on the Black Sea port of Odesa. Zelenskyy said the military equipment received from Western supporters had been a big help so far, but he also has stressed that Ukraine needs more heavy weapons, including long-range air defense systems, as well as warplanes to fend off the Russian attacks. The Russian military reported that it hit 423 Ukrainian targets overnight, including fortified positions and troops concentrations, while Russian warplanes destroyed 26 Ukrainian military sites, including an explosives factory and several artillery depots. Most of the fighting Sunday focused on the eastern Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces are concentrated and where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war. Since failing to capture Kyiv, the Russians are aiming to gain full control over Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on a Mariupol steel plant where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. The Azovstal steel mill where the defenders are holed up is the last corner of resistance in the city, which the Russians have otherwise occupied. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, called for a localized Easter truce. He urged Russia to allow civilians to leave the plant and suggested talks to negotiate an exit for the Ukrainian soldiers. Podolyak tweeted that the Russian military was attacking the plant with heavy bombs and artillery while accumulating forces and equipment for a direct assault. Mariupol has been the focus of fierce fighting since the start of the war due to its location on the Sea of Azov. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. More than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed. Satellite images released this week showed what appeared to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol. Zelenskyy accused the Russians of committing war crimes by killing civilians, as well as of setting up ""filtration camps"" near Mariupol for people caught trying to leave the city. From there, he said, Ukrainians are sent to areas under Russian occupation or to Russia itself, often as far as Siberia or the Far East. Many of them, he said, are children. The claims could not be independently verified. In attacks on the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russian forces pounded cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine. The 3-month-old baby was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at Odesa, Ukrainian officials said. Ukrainian news agency UNIAN, citing social media posts, reported that the infant's mother, Valeria Glodan, and grandmother also died when a missile hit a residential area. Zelenskyy promised to find and punish those responsible for the strike. ""The war started when this baby was one month old,″ he said. Can you imagine what is happening? ""They are filthy scum, there are no other words for it."""" For the Donbas offensive, Russia has reassembled troops who fought around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine earlier. The British Ministry of Defense said Sunday that Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week and ""inflicted significant cost on Russian forces."" ""Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,"" the ministry said in an intelligence update. The spiritual leaders of the world's Orthodox Christians and Roman Catholics appealed for relief for the suffering population of Ukraine. From Istanbul, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I said a ""human tragedy"" was unfolding. Bartholomew, considered the first among his Eastern Orthodox patriarch equals, citing in particular ""the thousands of people surrounded in Mariupol, civilians, among them the wounded, the elderly, women and many children."" Pope Francis, speaking from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square, renewed his call for an Easter truce, calling it ""a minimal and tangible sign of a desire for peace."" ""The attacks must be stopped, to respond to the suffering of the exhausted population,"" Francis said without naming the aggressor.",47,2.452617538657578,4.236031716082433,-1.7834141774248549,19
2022-04-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-director-christopher-wray-60-minutes-2022-04-24/,"FBI Director Christopher Wray on foreign cyberattacks, domestic terrorism and attacks on law enforcement - 60 Minutes","The FBI is engaging the war in Ukraine with an around-the-clock cyber defense against Russian military hackers. In a rare interview, FBI Director Christopher Wray told us how the bureau is engaging that war while fighting rising violence at home, terrorism abroad, and the unprecedented scale of theft by China. It's a lot to take on. Wray leads 35,000 men and women worldwide with the dual missions of fighting crime and counterespionage. We spoke, this past Thursday, at FBI headquarters in Washington and started with the bureau's cyber defense of Ukraine. Scott Pelley: You have put the FBI on a war footing? Christopher Wray: In effect, we have. We view this as combat posture, with respect to cyber activity. Scott Pelley: your orders are to help Ukraine keep the lights on, keep the communications flowing, and keep their critical infrastructure from being taken down? Christopher Wray: My instruction to our folks is to lean in, to lean forward, to be as helpful to them as we possibly can be to help them anticipate, prevent, defend, mitigate malicious Russian cyber activity. Scott Pelley: Has Russia increased cyber-attacks on the United States since the Ukraine invasion? Christopher Wray: I'm not sure I would say they've increased it, but certainly they've continued what they've been doing for years. And the prospect of that becoming more destructive and more severe is something that we're keenly watching for. So, we're treating it as sort of combat tempo. We have a 24/7 cyber command post running, and we've had now for several weeks. We've been pushing out intelligence products to private companies and others. We've been pushing out technical information to network defenders at a lotta these companies. In March, Wray's FBI defeated Russian military malware discovered on networks in the U.S. And around the world. The malware, prepared and laid in advance, was waiting to be activated. But the FBI electronically severed Russia's connection with its cyberweapon. Christopher Wray: And I can't get too specific about it here, but where we see a lotta those same sorts of activities, scanning, probing, preparation-- you know, trying to develop access. And so, the key is to work closely with partners, whether it's the Ukrainians when it's their critical infrastructure, whether it's private companies here in the United States to try to make sure that we're interrupting and disrupting that before it becomes more damaging and destructive. Wednesday, we followed Chris Wray to his morning briefing. We joined the unclassified part which was, essentially, ""good morning"" and Wray asking, ""whadda we got?"" Christopher Wray: On any given morning I'm gonna be hearing about say a domestic terrorist trying to blow up a hospital in the middle of a pandemic or an ISIS-inspired subject who's trying to blow up a synagogue or, you know, our cyber agents racing out to a children's hospital to prevent them from falling prey to a looming ransomware attack. Scott Pelley: Why did you take this job? You have to be right 100% of the time. Christopher Wray: I realize that this is not a job for the faint of heart. And I can assure the American people that I am not faint of heart. I was inspired to come back and take on this job because I believe deeply in the work, the mission of protecting American people and upholding the Constitution, and the people of the FBI. Christopher Wray is 55, married with two grown children. He graduated from Yale, and Yale Law. In the 90's he was a federal prosecutor in Atlanta. Over the years he rose to headquarters and led the Justice Department Criminal division. In 2005, he left for private practice but in 2017, after President Trump fired Director Jim Comey, wray was recruited. The Senate confirmation vote was a bipartisan landslide, 92 to five. Scott Pelley: Let's switch for a moment from counterintelligence to crime fighting. In 2020, there was a 29% jump in murder in the United States, nearly 5,000 more people killed than the year before. What is behind this leap in homicide? Christopher Wray: Certainly the pandemic didn't help. There's a variety of ways in which that contributed to it. We're seeing more and more juveniles committing violent crime, and that's certainly an issue. We're seeing a certain amount of gun trafficking, interstate gun trafficking. That's part of it. And we're seeing an alarming frequency of some of the worst of the worst getting back out on the streets. Scott Pelley: In 2021, there was a 59% increase in the murders of police officers, 73 officers killed. Christopher Wray: Violence against law enforcement in this country is one of the biggest phenomena that I think doesn't get enough attention. Last year, officers were being killed at a rate of almost one every five days. Scott Pelley: But why are more officers being killed right now? Christopher Wray: Some of it is tied to the violent crime problem as a whole. But one of the phenomena that we saw in the last year is that an alarming percentage of the 73 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty last year were killed through things like being ambushed or shot while out on patrol. Scott Pelley: They were killed because they were police officers. Christopher Wray: Right. Wearing the badge shouldn't make you a target. Wray lost two agents last year. Laura Schwartzenberger and Daniel Alfin were shot while executing a search warrant in a child pornography case. Christopher Wray: I heard about Laura and Dan's murders within really moments of it happening, from our Miami Field Office. And I was on the phone with their spouses within a few hours. And I was in their living rooms the next morning. And my reaction was a feeling of ache, almost sickness, inside-- in my distress. you know, it's the hardest thing I've encountered in this job. Scott Pelley: Can you say you're making any headway in violent crime? Christopher Wray: We are working very hard with our partners, state and local law enforcement partners, through task forces, task forces all over the country. And through surging rapid deployment teams to try to combat violent crime in specific hot spots. Last year I think we arrested something like 15,000 violent gang members around the country. And part of what fuels us to pursue this mission is our deep conviction that law enforcement's most sacred duty is to ensure that people can live free from fear in their own homes and neighborhood's. Scott Pelley: But Mr. Director, some people are in their homes living in fear of the police coming through the door with a no-knock warrant. And I wonder how the FBI can contribute to the reduction of police brutality, which also occurs in our country? Christopher Wray: Well, we take very seriously our responsibility to both protect the American people and uphold the Constitution. And that includes where it happens, going after police misconduct if it violates federal criminal law Perhaps the greatest controversy on Chris Wray's watch was the attack on the Capitol. The bureau has been criticized for failing to develop intelligence that might have predicted the assault. Christopher Wray: Over 800 people have now been charged. Agents in field offices all over the United States engaged in it. And we take this incredibly seriously-- Scott Pelley: But what you'd like to have is prevention. Christopher Wray: Our goal is to prevent terrorist attacks of any kind, domestic or international. Scott Pelley: The criticism of the FBI after January 6th was that the plans of these people were on social media and the FBI didn't see that. Christopher Wray: We at the FBI shared information through a variety of intelligence products for a solid year leading up to January 6th that raised the potential for violent extremism What we did not, to my knowledge, have was intelligence indicating that thousands of people were going to physically storm the U.S. Capitol in the middle of the constitutional process. Scott Pelley: What did you learn? Christopher Wray: You can bet we have been taking a hard look at how we can be even more preemptive, even more aggressive, even more responsive to make sure that we prevent something like that from ever happening again. And you can be sure, Americans can be sure, the FBI is fiercely determined to do our part with the other agencies to make sure that that never happens again. Scott Pelley: One of the things you learned was that these militia groups can organize and mobilize. Christopher Wray: And that's part of a broader phenomenon that we've seen over the last couple of years, of a variety of anti-government, anti-authority violent extremists. But a lot of the domestic terrorist threat that we face is not from well-organized, structured, traditional groups. In many ways, the hardest, biggest threat, terrorist threat that Americans face here in the homeland, is from what are essentially lone actors or people conspiring with one or two other people and using crude attack methods, a gun, a knife, a car So, if you think about the expression that a lot of Americans have heard about connecting the dots, for the kind of attack I'm describing, there are not a lotta dots to connect. Wray works to connect the dots from headquarters with a $10 billion annual budget, 56 U.S. field offices and more than 90 offices abroad. Scott Pelley: In counterintelligence, does anything worry you more than Russia? Christopher Wray: The biggest threat we face as a country from a counter-intelligence perspective is from the People's Republic of China, and especially the Chinese Communist Party. They are targeting our innovation, our trade secrets, our intellectual property on a scale that's unprecedented in history. They have a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined. They have stolen more of Americans' personal and corporate data than every nation combined. It affects everything from agriculture to aviation to high tech to healthcare, pretty much every sector of our economy. Anything that makes an industry tick, they target. Scott Pelley: What is the FBI doing about that? Christopher Wray: We are now moving at a pace where we're opening a new China counter-intelligence investigation about every 12 hours. There's well north of 2,000 of these investigations. All 56 of our field offices are engaged on it. And I can assure you that it's not because our agents don't have enough else to do. It's a measure of how significant the threat is. Christopher Wray is not quite halfway through his 10-year term. That means, by our count, nearly 1,400 more perfectly good mornings spoiled by that classified briefing. Scott Pelley: Do you go to bed at night and ask yourself, ""What did we miss?"" Christopher Wray: I'm always wondering about the-- as I think Secretary Rumsfeld famously said, ""the unknown unknown."" And that's probably the one thing that I worry about the most. Scott Pelley: What is the best guarantee you can make to the American people? Christopher Wray: I can't guarantee outcomes. What I can do is promise that I will try everything I can to make sure that we do the work in the right way-- that our process has integrity, has rigor, has objectivity-- that we bring those qualities to the work-- and that we will follow the facts wherever they lead, to whomever they lead, no matter who likes it.

2022-04-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-mariupol-evacuation-attempts-death-toll-mounts/,"Mariupol evacuation ""thwarted"" by Russian forces, official says, as death toll mounts","An attempted Ukrainian evacuation of civilians from the shattered city of Mariupol, where many remain trapped, was ""thwarted"" by Russian forces on Saturday, a city official said. ""The evacuation was thwarted,"" Mariupol city official Petro Andryushchenko said on Telegram, adding that around 200 residents had gathered at the evacuation meeting point announced by Kyiv, but Russian forces ""dispersed"" them. He claimed others were told to board buses headed to Dukuchayevsk, about 50 miles north, which is controlled by Russia. ""The people did not have the right to leave the bus,"" he said. Russian forces blamed ""firing by (Ukrainian) nationalists at the evacuation point"" for changing the destination, he added. ""Once again the Russians have disrupted an evacuation,"" he said. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk had earlier announced that Ukraine would make a new attempt on Saturday to evacuate civilians from Mariupol and warned that Russian forces could try to organize a parallel evacuation route to Russia. The attempted evacuation came a day after a senior Russian military officer said ""the second phase of the special operation"" -- as Moscow terms its invasion of Ukraine -- had begun, with the aim of controlling a huge, strategic part of Ukrainian territory. ""One of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine,"" Major General Rustam Minnekaev said on Friday. The announcement marked far wider war goals than what Moscow previously stated. Russian forces, which withdrew from around Kyiv and the north of Ukraine after being frustrated in their attempts to take over the capital, already occupy much of the eastern Donbas region and the south. Minnekaev said their focus was now to ""provide a land corridor to Crimea,"" which Russia annexed in 2014, and towards a breakaway pro-Russian region of Moldova, Transnistria, where the general claimed Russian-speaking people were ""being oppressed."" The Moldovan government has been rattled by the Russian attack on its neighbor, with Moldovans fearing that Russian President Vladimir Putin could potentially then move further West. Moldova has accepted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees since the war broke out on February 24. Its government has condemned Russia's war and submitted a bid to join the European Union along with Georgia and Ukraine. It is also seeking the EU's support in handling the influx of refugees and calling on the bloc to step up support for the country. Ukrainian authorities have vowed to fight on and drive the Russian troops from their land, but they also sought an Easter pause. ""Unfortunately, Russia rejected the proposal to establish an Easter truce,"" said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week. In his regular Friday night address, Zelenskyy said the Russian general's comments were a clear articulation of Moscow's goals. ""This only confirms what I have already said multiple times: Russia's invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning,"" he said. Ukraine's government, emboldened by an influx of Western weaponry, said its beleaguered forces were still holding out inside a sprawling steelworks in the razed port city of Mariupol. The Kremlin has claimed the ""liberation"" of Mariupol, which is pivotal to its war plans nearly two months after President Vladimir Putin ordered the shock invasion of Russia's Western-leaning neighbor. In a phone call to Putin, EU chief Charles Michel appealed for humanitarian access to Mariupol, which has been largely destroyed by weeks of intense Russian bombardment. ""Strongly urged for immediate humanitarian access and safe passage from Mariupol and other besieged cities all the more on the occasion of Orthodox Easter,"" Michel tweeted. Putin however accused Kyiv of refusing to allow its troops to surrender in Mariupol. ""All servicemen of the Ukrainian armed forces, militants of the national battalions and foreign mercenaries who laid down their arms are guaranteed life,"" Putin told Michel, the Kremlin said. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported Friday that thousands of Ukrainians remained trapped inside a steel plant in Mariupol, surrounded by forces loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who earlier claimed victory in the city. Ukrainian officials said 100,000 people could still be stuck in Mariupol, which has been the site of some of the worst fighting in the war. Russia's defense ministry earlier said it was ready to observe a humanitarian pause if Kyiv's troops surrendered. ""The enemy's offensive operation in the south hinges on Mariupol. The enemy is trying to focus all its efforts on it,"" Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the eastern region of Donetsk, told AFP. Near the frontlines in eastern Ukraine, a smattering of residents still held out amid frequent bouts of shelling. After two months of sustained Russian artillery fire, the hamlet of Lysychansk, located just 9 miles from Russian ground forces, has largely turned into a ghost town. Only a small sheltered market in the center of town is still operating, providing food and other supplies after the town's other market was bombed. ""Everyone, this is going to end badly,"" said an elderly woman in line for vegetables, fearing a targeted strike by Russian forces similar to a deadly train station rocket attack in the nearby town of Kramatorsk on April 8 that killed at least 52 people. In Severodonetsk, just 6 miles from Russian positions, the city's volunteers and medical personnel continue to hold the fort in a local hospital that is littered with broken windows and some floors are plunged into darkness. Shelling resumed recently, and the city is likely to soon be surrounded by advancing Russian troops. ""We will stay here until the last patient,"" says Roman Vodianik, the hospital's chief, whose office is decorated with Orthodox Christian icons. Russia's change of strategic focus to southern and eastern Ukraine saw invading forces leave behind a trail of indiscriminate destruction and civilian bodies around Kyiv, including in the commuter town of Bucha. A United Nations mission to Bucha documented ""the unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of some 50 civilians there"", the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said. Its spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said Russian forces had ""indiscriminately shelled and bombed populated areas, killing civilians and wrecking hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure, actions that may amount to war crimes"". Ukrainian officials say the bodies of more than 1,000 civilians have been retrieved from areas around Kyiv.",47,4.266023950300905,2.0286331912117195,2.2373907590891857,19

But Russia's recent defeats in and around Kyiv expose unresolved weaknesses, starting with Russia's armored vehicles. To date, Ukraine says Russia has lost close to 3,000 armored vehicles — but only half in combat. ""It's not good military leadership if you are losing so many men and so much equipment,"" Ukrainian military expert Yuri Zbanatski told CBS News' Chris Livesay. In the city of Bucha, a graveyard of Russian tanks remain behind — damaged by artillery, fragments and explosions. Oryx, a military and intelligence blog which counts Russia's military losses in Ukraine on the basis of photographs sent from the war zone, reports that Russia has lost more than 460 tanks. ""They [the tanks] were abandoned or ran out of fuel, and it's finders keepers for these farmers,"" Zbanatski said. ""Their personnel is not properly trained. Their commanding officers are not able to plan their offensive operations properly."" Russia's power is now being tested in the eastern Donbas region.

Andriy Yermak, chief of staff for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a Telegram post that two missile strikes from Russian troops struck a residential area in the city ""Nothing is sacred,"" Yermak wrote. ""Evil will be punished."" Meanwhile, Russian forces in Ukraine tried to storm a steel plant housing soldiers and civilians in the southern city of Mariupol on Saturday while attempting to crush the last corner of resistance in a place of deep symbolic and strategic value to Moscow, Ukrainian officials said. The reported assault on the eve of Orthodox Easter came after the Kremlin claimed its military had seized all of the shattered city except for the Azovstal plant, and as Russian forces pounded other cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine. The fate of the Ukrainians in the sprawling seaside steel mill wasn't immediately clear; earlier Saturday, a Ukrainian military unit released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun. ""We want to see peaceful skies, we want to breathe in fresh air,"" one woman in the video said. ""You have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea. For us, it is already happiness."" As the battle for the port ground on, Russia claimed it had taken control of several villages elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region and destroyed 11 military Ukrainian military targets overnight, including three artillery warehouses. Russian attacks also struck populated areas of Ukraine. Associated Press journalists also observed shelling in residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city; regional governor reported Oleh Sinehubov said three people were killed. In the Luhansk area of the Donbas, Gov. Serhiy Haidai said six people died during the shelling of a village, Gorskoi In Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas. The AP witnessed two soldiers arriving at the town's hospital, one of them mortally wounded. Nearby, a small group of people gathered outside a church, where a priest blessed them with water on Holy Saturday. While British officials said the Russians hadn't gained significant new ground, Ukrainian officials announced a nationwide curfew ahead of Easter Sunday, a sign of the war's disruption and threat to the entire country. Mariupol, a part of the industrial region in eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas, has been a key Russian objective since the Feb. 24 invasion began and has taken on outsize importance in the war. Completing its capture would give Russia its biggest victory yet, after a nearly two-month siege reduced much of the city to a smoking ruin. Occupying Mariupol would deprive the Ukrainians of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere and allow Russia to create a land corridor with the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. Russia-backed separatists control parts of the Donbas. Russian forces have claimed victory in the city. But Russia's recent defeats in and around Kyiv expose unresolved weaknesses, starting with Russia's armored vehicles. To date, Ukraine says Russia has lost close to 3,000 armored vehicles — but only half in combat. ""It's not good military leadership if you are losing so many men and so much equipment,"" Ukrainian military expert Yuri Zbanatski told CBS News' Chris Livesay. An advisor to Ukraine's presidential office, Oleksiy Arestovich, said during a Saturday briefing that Russian forces had resumed air strikes on the Azovstal plant and were trying to storm it. A direct attempt to take the plant would represent a reversal from an order Russian President Vladimir Putin gave two days earlier. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin on Thursday that the whole of Mariupol, with the exception of Azovstal, had been ""liberated"" by the Russians. At the time, Putin ordered him not to send Russian troops into the plant but instead to block off the facility, an apparent attempt to starve out the Ukrainians and force them to surrender. Ukrainian officials have estimated that about 2,000 of their troops are inside the plant along with the civilians sheltering in the facility's underground tunnels. Arestovic said the Ukrainian forces were trying to counter the new attacks. Earlier Saturday, the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, which has members holed up in the plant, released the footage of around two dozen women and children. The contents could not be independently verified. If authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians still trapped in Mariupol's underground bunkers. The video showed soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl says she and her relatives ""haven't seen neither the sky, nor the sun"" since they left home on Feb. 27. The regiment's deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told The AP the video was shot Thursday. The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed in 2014 by far-right activists at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. More than 100,000 people - down from a prewar population of about 430,000 - are believed trapped in Mariupol with little food, water or heat, according to Ukrainian authorities, who estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city during the Russian blockade. Satellite images released this week showed what appeared to be a second mass grave near Mariupol, and local officials accused Russia of burying thousands of civilians to conceal the slaughter taking place there. The Kremlin hasn't responded to the satellite images. Ukrainian officials had said they would try again Saturday to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Telegram that the effort was to get underway at midday. Like previous plans to get civilians out of the city, this one failed. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Mariupol's mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organized buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 227 kilometers (141 miles) to the northwest. ""At 11 o'clock, at least 200 Mariupol residents gathered near the Port City shopping center, waiting for evacuation,"" Andryushchenko posted on the Telegram messaging app. ""The Russian military drove up to the Mariupol residents and ordered them to disperse, because now there will be shelling."" At the same time, he said, Russian buses assembled about 200 meters away. Residents who got on board were told that they were being taken to separatist-occupied territory and not allowed to disembark, Andryushchenko said. His account could not be independently verified. During the attack on Odesa, the Russians fired at least six missiles, Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's interior minister. Defense forces repelled some of the rockets, but at least one landed and exploded, he said. ""Residents of the city heard explosions in different areas,"" Gerashchenko wrote in a Telegram post. ""Residential buildings were hit. It is already known about one victim. He burned in his car in a courtyard of one of the buildings."" The Ukraine presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, later reported that the 3-month-old baby was among the five people killed in the missile attack. In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced all the war's casualties, noting that the Easter holiday commemorates Christ's resurrection after his death by crucifixion. ""We believe in the victory, of life over death,"" he said. ""No matter how fierce the battles are, there is no chance for death to defeat life. Everyone knows that. Every Christian knows that.""",47,2.263984010862365,1.0953539516739184,1.1686300591884466,19

""First and foremost, this senseless war must stop. But as the fighting shows no sign of abating, it is vital that all parties to the conflict give clear instructions to their combatants to strictly respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law,"" U.N. Human Rights spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said in a briefing to journalists. Satellite images released late Thursday appeared to show more than 200 new graves in a town where Ukrainian officials say the Russians have been burying Mariupol residents killed in the fighting. The eastern port city of Mariupol has seen some of the worst suffering of the war, and the imagery, from Maxar Technologies, showed long rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery in the town of Manhush, some 12 miles from Mariupol. Local officials accused Russia of burying up to 9,000 Ukrainian civilians in mass graves in an effort to conceal the slaughter taking place in the city, which has been under siege since the early days of the war. ""The bodies of the dead were being brought by the truckload and actually simply being dumped in mounds,"" Piotr Andryushchenko, an aide to Mariupol's mayor, said on Telegram. There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin on the satellite pictures. When mass graves and hundreds of dead civilians were discovered in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv after Russian troops retreated three weeks ago, Russian officials denied that their soldiers killed any civilians there and falsely accused Ukraine of staging the atrocities. People fleeing Mariupol have described being trapped in horrible conditions. Yuriy and Polina Lulac said they spent nearly two months living in a basement with at least a dozen other people with no running water and little food. ""What was happening there was so horrible that you can't describe it,"" said Yuriy Lulac, who used a derogatory word for the Russian troops, saying they were ""killing people for nothing."" ""Mariupol is gone. In the courtyards there are just graves and crosses,"" he said. ""Over these eight weeks, international humanitarian law has not merely been ignored but seemingly tossed aside,"" Shamdasani said. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights' mission in Ukraine has verified 5,264 civilian casualties, including 2,345 deaths, since the war began on Feb. 24. It said that 92.3% of those were recorded in Ukrainian government-controlled territory. The office uses strict methodology and has long acknowledged that its confirmed figures are far short of the real numbers. ""The actual numbers are going to be much higher"" as more details emerge from places such as Mariupol where there is intense fighting,"" Shamdasani said. ""Almost every resident in Bucha our colleagues spoke to told us about the death of a relative, a neighbour or even a stranger. We know much more needs to be done to uncover what happened there and we also know Bucha is not an isolated incident,"" Shamdasani said. The office said in a statement that ""Russian armed forces have indiscriminately shelled and bombed populated areas, killing civilians and wrecking hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure - actions that may amount to war crimes."" It added that the U.N. mission also has ""documented what appears to be the use of weapons with indiscriminate effects, causing civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects, by Ukrainian armed forces in the east of the country."" On April 9, U.N. human rights officers visiting Bucha documented the unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of around 50 civilians. ""The scale of summary executions of civilians in areas previously occupied by Russian forces is emerging,"" Shamdasani said. ""The preservation of evidence and decent treatment of mortal remains must be ensured, as well as psychological and other relief for victims and their relatives."" The U.N. mission has received more than 300 allegations of killings of civilians in previously occupied towns in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions. The U.N. rights office said its mission also has recorded 114 attacks on medical facilities ""although the actual figure is likely to be considerably higher."" ""We estimate that at least 3,000 civilians have died because they couldn't get medical care and because of the stress on their health amid the hostilities,"" Shamdasani said. ""This includes being forced by Russian armed forces to stay in basements or not being allowed to leave their homes for days or weeks."" The U.N. mission so far has received 75 allegations of sexual violence against women, men, girls and boys by Russian soldiers, most in the Kyiv region. The human rights office said detention of civilians ""has become a widespread practice"" in areas controlled by Russian forces and affiliated groups, with 155 such cases reported so far. It said it also received information about ""alleged arbitrary and incommunicado detentions"" by Ukrainian forces or people aligned with them. And it pointed to videos put out by both sides apparently showing the intimidation, interrogation, torture or killing of prisoners of war. ""Those in command of armed forces must make it clear to their fighters that anyone found to have been involved in such violations will be prosecuted and held accountable,"" Shamdasani said.",45,3.268373767417549,2.289580630161025,0.978793137256524,8

Thousands more Ukrainians remained trapped inside a steel plant in Mariupol, surrounded by forces loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who earlier claimed victory in the city. Ukrainian officials said 100,000 people could still be stuck in Mariupol, which has been the site of some of the worst fighting in the war. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a proposed truce for the upcoming Orthodox Easter weekend had been rejected by Russia. Civilian casualties continued to mount along the front lines of the fighting. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has suffered intense bombardment since the conflict began, the mayor said Russia continued to furiously bomb the city. Yana Bachek was on her way to visit her father when she found out he had been killed by a chunk of shrapnel after stepping out of his apartment to buy bread.

The announcement marks far wider war goals than what Moscow previously stated. ""Since the beginning of the second stage of the special operation, and it started just two days ago, one of the tasks of the Russian army has been to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine. That will ensure the opening of a land corridor to Crimea and influence critical elements of the Ukrainian economy,"" acting Central Military District Commander Rustam Minnekayev said at an annual meeting of the Union of Defense Plants of the Sverdlovsk Region on Friday. ""Establishing control over southern Ukraine would also give the Russian army access to Transdniestria, where facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population have also been observed,"" Minnekayev said. Transdniestria is the de-facto breakaway region of Moldova that is not internationally recognized but has pro-Russian leaders and about 1,500 Russian troops stationed there. The Kremlin used claims of discrimination against the Russian-speaking population to justify its invasion of Ukraine two months ago, along with accusations against Ukraine and NATO that supposedly infringed on Russia's security. The Moldovan government has been rattled by the Russian attack on its neighbor, with Moldovans fearing that Russian President Vladimir Putin could potentially then move further West. Moldova has accepted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees since the war broke out on February 24. Its government has condemned Russia's war and submitted a bid to join the European Union along with Georgia and Ukraine. It is also seeking the EU's support in handling the influx of refugees and calling on the bloc to step up support for the country. But it is also trying to carefully balance its neutral stance with NATO to signal it is not willing to be the next target for Russia. Before the Russian military retreated from the capital city Kyiv, Moscow claimed that ""the first stage"" of the attack had been completed, and it is now focusing efforts on the ""liberation"" of two regions in the east to bring them under the control of pro-Russian leaders in the so-called breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. Military experts and Western officials linked the Russian retreat from Kyiv to significant losses in personnel and hardware as Ukrainian resistance appeared to have exceeded Russian expectations and toppled the initial goal of swiftly capturing the capital and claiming quick victory. But now, Russia appears to scale up its official goals again, targeting southern Ukrainian cities, even though its previous attempts to attack them have stalled. If Russia proceeds in this direction of attack, its primary targets would be the key port city of Odesa along nearby Mykolayiv. The tenacity of Mykolayiv's resistance in March kept the invading force from advancing to Odesa on the ground, but Russian warships off the coast have been firing missiles into nearby towns.",7,3.8089017808610826,2.0588802254236658,1.7500215554374168,7

The satellite images were released as Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory in the battle for Mariupol, even as he ordered his troops not to take the risk of storming the giant steel plant where the last Ukrainian defenders in the city were holed up. Instead, he directed his forces to seal off the Azovstal plant ""so that not even a fly comes through."" After nearly two lethal months of bombardment that have largely reduced Mariupol to a smoking ruin, Russian forces appear to control the rest of the strategic southern city, including its vital but now badly damaged port. But the Ukrainian troops have stubbornly held out. A few thousand defenders, by Russia's estimate, have been holed up for weeks along with hundreds of civilians in the sprawling steel plant, as Putin's forces pounded the site and repeatedly demanded they surrender. But on Thursday, the Russian leader declared victory without taking the plant, which covers 4 square miles and is threaded with some 15 miles of tunnels and bunkers. ""The completion of combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success,"" he said in an appearance with his defense minister. ""Congratulations."" Instead of mounting a frontal attack on the plant, Russia apparently intends to maintain the siege and wait for the defenders to surrender when they run out of food or ammunition. Ukraine scoffed at the notion of a Russian victory. ""This situation means the following: They cannot physically capture Azovstal. They have understood this. They suffered huge losses there,"" said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Leaving the plant in Ukrainian hands robs the Russians of the ability to declare complete victory in Mariupol, which has seen some of the most dramatic fighting of the war and whose capture has both strategic and symbolic importance. The scale of suffering there has made it a worldwide focal point, and its definitive fall would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, and free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas. ""If it weren't for the Ukrainian soldiers, we would have no food,"" one young mother, who is among the civilians sheltering in the steel plant, said. Children in the plant were using empty food containers as toys and said they couldn't wait to go to the grocery store, CBS News' Chris Livesay reported. Another woman said some of the children's ""teeth are starting to rot because they lack vitamin D. There's not enough sun."" ""Please help us,"" another mother begged. ""And to those who started this war against us, I hope you feel our pain on your own skin, and that your kids can feel this pain too.""",47,1.9407888561295703,0.6729815779355981,1.2678072781939722,19

Ukrainian officials did not comment on Putin's remarks, but earlier said four buses with civilians managed to escape from the city after several unsuccessful attempts. Thousands more remained the city, much of which has been reduced to a smoking ruin in a nearly two-month siege, with over 20,000 people feared dead. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said another attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol would be made Thursday, though it was not clear how the latest comments would affect that. In Kyiv, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Denmark's Mette Frederiksen became the latest European leaders to show support with a visit to the capital. They were due to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who warned in a video address overnight that the Russians were not ""abandoning their attempts to score at least some victory by launching a new, large-scale offensive."" ""The West stands together to support the Ukrainian people,"" Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said in a statement. Meanwhile, the Kremlin said it submitted a draft of its demands for ending the war, and the West raced to supply Ukraine with heavier weapons to counter the Russians' new drive to seize the industrial east. Britain's Defense Ministry said in an assessment that Russia likely desires to demonstrate significant successes ahead of its annual May 9 Victory Day celebrations. ""This could affect how quickly and forcefully they attempt to conduct operations in the run-up to this date,"" he said. As fears grew for the fate of civilians in Mariupol, the Kyiv regional police said Thursday that two mass graves with nine bodies were discovered in the city of Borodyanka, northwest of the capital. The findings added to thousands of civilians reported killed by Russian forces, who have been accused of wholesale abuses of Ukrainians. The head of the Kyiv regional police, Andriy Nebytov, said two women and a teenager were among the ""civilians killed by the Russian occupiers."" ""I want to stress that these people are civilians. The Russian military deliberately shot civilians that didn't put up any resistance and didn't pose any threat,"" Nebytov said, adding that some of the victims were apparently tortured. With global tensions running high, Russia reported the first successful test launch of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, the Sarmat. Putin boasted that it can overcome any missile defense system and make those who threaten Russia ""think twice."" The head of the Russian state aerospace agency called the launch out of northern Russia ""a present to NATO."" The Pentagon described the test as ""routine"" and said it wasn't considered a threat. On the battlefield, Ukraine said Moscow continued to mount assaults across the east, probing for weak points in Ukrainian defensive lines. Russia said it launched hundreds of missile and air attacks on targets that included concentrations of troops and vehicles. The Kremlin's stated goal is the capture of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern region that is home to coal mines, metal plants and heavy-equipment factories. Detaching it from the rest of Ukraine would give Putin a badly needed victory two months into the war, after the botched attempt to storm the capital, Kyiv. The U.K. Defense Ministry said Russian forces were advancing from staging areas in the Donbas toward Kramatorsk, which continues to suffer from persistent rocket attacks. The Luhansk governor said Russian forces control 80% of his region, which is one of two that make up the Donbas. Before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the Kyiv government controlled 60% of the Luhansk region. Gov. Serhiy Haidai said the Russians, after seizing the small city of Kreminna, are now threatening the cities of Rubizhne and Popasna. He urged all residents to evacuate immediately. ""The occupiers control only parts of these cities, unable to break through to the centers,"" Haidai said on the messaging app Telegram. Analysts have said the offensive in the east could become a war of attrition as Russia faces Ukraine's most experienced, battle-hardened troops, who have fought pro-Moscow separatists in the Donbas for eight years. Russia said it presented Ukraine with a draft document outlining its demands for ending the conflict, days after Putin said the talks were at a ""dead end."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that ""the ball is in their court, we're waiting for a response."" He gave no details on the draft, and it was not clear when it was sent or whether it offered anything new to the Ukrainians, who presented their own demands last month. Zelenskyy said he had not seen or heard of the proposal, though one of his top advisers said the Ukrainian side was reviewing it. Moscow has long demanded Ukraine drop any bid to join NATO. Ukraine has said it would agree to that in return for security guarantees from other countries. Other sources of tension include the status of both the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Moscow in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where the separatists have declared independent republics recognized by Russia. A Zelenskyy adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter that he and other Ukrainian negotiators were ready to hold talks without conditions to save the lives of trapped Mariupol defenders and civilians. There was no immediate response from Russia. Elsewhere, some residents of the eastern city of Kharkiv have lived in basements for weeks, trying to stay safe from Russian shelling. With no running water, gas or electricity, they collect rainwater and cook on open fires, burning debris from destroyed wooden buildings. In one neighborhood, they sought safety in a school basement - using desks, tables and chairs to fashion beds. More than 300 people slept there during the first days of the war, but most have left for safer places, and only a few dozen remain. As Russia funneled troops and equipment into the Donbas, Western nations rushed to boost the flow of military supplies to Kyiv for this new phase of the war - likely to involve trench warfare, long-range artillery attacks and tank battles across relatively open terrain. President Joe Biden was set to announce plans Thursday to send more military aid to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Zelenskyy said Ukraine's Western allies have ""come to understand our needs better,"" adding that Ukraine is receiving new shipments of Western weapons ""now, when Russia is trying to step up its attacks, not in weeks or in a month.""",47,1.5516706902047859,2.881320919753483,-1.329650229548697,19
2022-04-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/mariupol-ukraine-russia-war-last-days/,"Ukrainian commander in Mariupol pleads for help: ""We are probably facing our last days, if not hours""","Ukraine said a preliminary agreement was reached to establish a humanitarian corridor and evacuate thousands of people from the besieged coastal city of Mariupol on Wednesday, as Russia hurled its military might against Ukrainian cities and towns in an attempt to slice the country in two and gain control of the eastern industrial heartland of coal mines and factories. The fighting unfolded along a boomerang-shaped front of hundreds of miles in what is known as the eastern Donbas region. If successful, Russian President Vladimir Putin would be able to claim a victory following his failed attempt to storm the capital, Kyiv, and heavier-than-expected Russian casualties. Key to the Russian campaign is the capture of the city of Mariupol, which would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. It would also free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas region. Ukrainian troops said the Russian military dropped heavy bombs to flatten what was left of a sprawling steel plant in Mariupol - believed to be the city's defenders' last holdout, and hit a hospital where hundreds were staying. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said there was a ""preliminary"" agreement to open a humanitarian corridor for women, children and the elderly to leave Mariupol west to the Ukraine-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Wednesday afternoon. She said on the messaging app Telegram that civilians in Mariupol were facing a ""catastrophic humanitarian situation."" Vereshchuk previously said no agreement had been reached with Russia on an evacuation route on each of the past three days. There was no immediate confirmation from the Russian side, which issued a new ultimatum to the Ukrainian defenders to surrender Wednesday after a previous ultimatum was ignored. Ukraine and Russia have frequently blamed each other for obstructing evacuations from Mariupol or firing along the agreed route, which has typically only been open to people in private vehicles. ""We are probably facing our last days, if not hours,"" a commander of the Ukrainian marines fighting in the steel plant, Serhiy Volyna, said in a video posted on social media. ""The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to 1. They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks. We are only defending one object, the Azovstal plant where, in addition to military personnel, there are also civilians who have fallen victim to this war. We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us. We ask them to use the procedure of 'extraction' and take us to the territory of a third party state. All of us, Mariupol military battalion of soldiers, more than 500 wounded, and hundreds of civilians including women and children, we plead to take us to safety on the territory of a third party state,"" Volyna said. ""I can confirm that there are a lot of civilians,"" Deputy Mayor of Mariupol Sergei Orlov told CBS News partner network BBC News. ""They know that steel plants had good bomb shelter and some stocked food and water in the bomb shelter. That's why they decided with their families to live in this bomb shelter."" Orlov said no help was currently possible for the people in the steel plant. ""They have an absolute lack of everything. A lack of water, food, medicines, help, and Russia totally blocks everything, any humanitarian help or evacuation,"" Orlov said. The eastern cities of Kharkiv and Kramatorsk also came under deadly attack. Russia said it struck areas around Dnipro and Zaporizhia with missiles. Near Zaporizhia, 29-year-old paratrooper Vyacheslav Dimovon was laid to rest after a Russian anti-tank mine took his life on Saturday. His mother, Alla, told CBS News' Charlie D'Agata how important it had been for Dimovon to fight for his country. ""He dreamed like crazy of becoming a soldier,"" Alla said. ""But I didn't bring him into this world for war, but for a peaceful life. So he could live with his beloved wife Ivanna."" Dimovon and his 23-year old widow had only been married for 18 months. They were planning to start a family when the war broke out. ""Every time we spoke, I told him: 'I love you, look after yourself,'"" Ivanna told CBS News. She said she had known every video call with her husband could be their last. ""'Now, it's: 'I love you, look after me,'"" she said. Both sides have described the Russian assault that began Monday as a new phase of the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russian military was throwing everything it has into the battle, with most of its combat-ready forces now concentrated in Ukraine and just across the border in Russia. ""They have driven almost everyone and everything that is capable of fighting us against Ukraine,"" he said in his nightly video address to the nation. Despite claims that they are hitting only military sites, the Russians continue to target residential areas and kill civilians, he said. He also said the Kremlin has not responded to a proposal to exchange Viktor Medvedchuk, the jailed leader of a pro-Russia party, for the Mariupol defenders. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon's assessments of the war, said the Russians had added two combat units, known as battalion tactical groups, in Ukraine over the preceding 24 hours. That brought the total units in the country to 78, all of them in the south and the east, up from 65 last week, the official said. That would translate to 55,000 to 62,000 troops, based on what the Pentagon said at the start of the war was the typical unit strength of 700 to 800 soldiers. But accurately determining Russia's fighting capacity at this stage is difficult. A European official, likewise speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said Russia also has 10,000 to 20,000 foreign fighters in the Donbas region. They are a mix of mercenaries from Russia's private Wagner Group and Russian proxy fighters from Syria and Libya, according to the official.",47,1.0450417763589588,2.6914552286182283,-1.6464134522592695,19
2022-04-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-weapons-united-states-howitzers/,Latest U.S. weapons assistance arrives in Ukraine,"The first shipments of the latest round of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, which includes heavier weapons systems, started arriving in the region over the weekend, according to the Pentagon. The recently approved $800 million in security assistance includes Howitzer artillery systems, 40,000 artillery rounds, armored personnel vehicles and other weapons. A senior U.S. defense official said Monday that four flights of shipments from the assistance package arrived in the region over the weekend with a fifth expected in the next 24 hours. The official did not detail which weapons from the recent package landed in the region first. On Tuesday, a senior defense official said that assistance to Ukraine can be deployed incredibly fast: in as little as 48-72 hours, the process of receiving necessary approvals, gathering and shipping the equipment can be completed. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby in a press briefing said the Defense Department expects to start training Ukrainian trainers outside of Ukraine on how to use the U.S.-provided Howitzers in the coming days. The Ukrainian trainers will then return to Ukraine and train more troops. According to Kirby, the training isn't expected to take long since the Ukrainians already know how to use artillery systems and merely need to familiarize themselves with the American systems. The Ukrainians use 152mm artillery systems, and the U.S. is providing 155mm artillery systems. The Russians have refocused on the Donbas region after failing to control Kyiv. The Pentagon assesses they are now conducting ""staging operations,"" which involves ""setting the conditions for more aggressive, more overt and larger ground maneuvers"" in the east, according to Kirby. The impending fight in the east is expected to rely more on armored vehicles and artillery systems than in the north since the terrain in southeastern Ukraine is more flat and wide open. ""The artillery is a specific item the Ukrainians asked for because of the specific fighting they expect is going to occur in the Donbas,"" Kirby said on Monday. ""And we know the Russians also believe the same thing because we see them moving artillery units into the Donbas as well."" On Tuesday, Kirby observed that fighting in the Donbas would be characterized by ""a whole different type of fighting,"" that would entail long-range firing and artillery. He acknowledged that in the future, ""it is certainly within the realm of the possible that the Ukrainians will want additional artillery systems and additional artillery rounds and we will have those conversations with them and we will if that's the need, we'll do everything we can to meet it."" The recently approved $800 million in assistance to Ukraine also includes Switchblade drones, more Javelin anti-tank missiles, and armored personnel carriers. Overall, the U.S. has provided $2.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded at the end of February.",49,4.455746251601371,6.536164923220124,-2.0804186716187525,27

Meanwhile, new pictures emerged that appeared to show Russia's Moskva warship, with smoke billowing from the rear, starting to sink after allegedly being struck by Ukrainian missiles. After weeks of unrelenting onslaught, Ukraine's Prime Minister said his forces were continuing to make a stand in the coastal city of Mariupol, despite renewed threats from Russia that any remaining Ukrainian soldiers would be ""eliminated.""

NATO estimates that up to 45,000 Russian troops have been killed, captured, or injured since the invasion began. Amid the suffering and fear, worshippers in Ukraine gathered over the weekend for the start of Holy Week. Easter is celebrated next Sunday.

""When people undergo all this grief and atrocities, and they still hope, still believe, still say that they feel the hand of God that guides them, this belief becomes their reality,"" Vladyslav said. But the war has turned the church into a battlefield too, after Russian Orthodox leaders gave their blessing to the war and President Putin. Vladyslav said that makes the Russian Orthodox Church ""an accomplice."" ""It's a position no church should ever take.

""It's a place I've described as a center of hell,"" he said. He said the U.N. receives offers ""day by day"" to create humanitarian corridors that are ""not cleared by"" one side or the other, and families have been trapped. ""We don't really know the numbers of people still caught and blocked and unable to get out from Mariupol,"" Griffith said. Mariupol has been under relentless bombardment for seven weeks, leaving much of the city in ruins. Officials estimate roughly 21,000 people there have been killed, and 120,000 are still in the city, which is nearly encircled by Russian forces. ""The situation in Mariupol is both dire militarily and heartbreaking. The city doesn't exist anymore,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Sunday on ""Face the Nation."" ""This is something, which as each week goes by, is becoming more difficult,"" Griffith said, ""this is a generational problem that we're going to have to face."" The U.N. refugee agency says nearly 5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the war began on February 24. A smaller number — over 870,000 people — have now returned, as Russian troops pulled back from areas around Kyiv to focus on fighting in the east.The influx leaves the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), which Griffiths heads, ""concerned about deteriorating food security."" Despite security concerns, ""most Ukrainians want to return as quickly as possible and as long as they can be safe,"" Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told CBS News on Monday. The U.N. has rallied agencies that are staying on the ground in Ukraine to be a lifeline for food, clean water and medicine but have been powerless to stop what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council nations earlier this month was the devastation of his country, where Russian troops ""killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" The Ukraine Prosecutor General and the International Criminal Court as well as the U.N. Human Rights Council and several countries have begun to collect evidence for investigations of war crimes, amid widespread reports that Russian forces deliberately killed civilians. Griffiths, who has traveled to several countries, most recently speaking with officials in Moscow and Kyiv, said mediation efforts have not yet succeeded. He said his agency has asked both countries to meet to discuss humanitarian proposals including a ceasefire, monitoring, safe passage, corridors, and other priorities, and he is traveling to Turkey this week to follow through on President Erdogan's effort to mediate. Griffiths said that the international agencies need several-day windows to evacuate civilians, and Russia has not given those yet. Although UNOCHA has ""had a number of successful movements of convoys,"" he said the number is ""completely inadequate."" Asked about the places where the war is still raging, Griffiths expressed great concern for the region in the east.

2022-04-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mariupol-ukraine-war-siege-port-city/,Ukraine remains defiant as key port city of Mariupol teeters on the brink,"Kyiv, Ukraine — The battered port city of Mariupol appeared on the brink of falling to Russian forces Sunday after seven weeks under siege, a development that what would give Moscow a crucial success in Ukraine following a botched attempt to storm the capital and the loss of the Russian navy's Black Sea flagship. The Russian military estimated that about 2,500 Ukrainian fighters holding out at a hulking steel plant with a warren of underground passageways provided the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol. Russia gave another deadline for their surrender, saying those who put down their weapons were ""guaranteed to keep their lives,"" but Ukraine remained defiant. ""All those who will continue resistance will be destroyed,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Defense Ministry's spokesman, said. He said intercepted communications indicated there were about 400 foreign mercenaries along with the Ukrainian troops at the Azovstal steel mill, a claim that couldn't be independently verified. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that the situation in the city is ""dire"" and ""heartbreaking."" ""The city doesn't exist anymore. The remainings of the Ukrainian army and large group of civilians are basically encircled by the Russian forces,"" Kuleba said. ""They continue their struggle, but it seems from the way the Russian army behaves in Mariupol, they decided to raze the city to the ground at any cost."" Seizing Mariupol would free up Russian forces to weaken and encircle Ukrainian soldiers forces in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has focused its war aims for now and is deploying personnel and equipment withdrawn from the north after the failure to take Kyiv. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar described Mariupol as a ""shield defending Ukraine"" as Russian troops prepare for a full-scale offensive in Donbas, the country's eastern industrial heartland where Moscow-backed separatists already control some territory. In a reminder that no part of Ukraine was immune until the war ends, Russian forces carried out new missile strikes Sunday near Kyiv and elsewhere in an apparent effort to weaken Ukraine's military capacity before the anticipated assault in the east. After the humiliating loss of the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, Russia's military command vowed Friday to step up missile strikes on the capital. The Russian military said Sunday that it had attacked an ammunition plant near Kyiv overnight with precision-guided missiles, the third such strike in as many days. Russia's stepped-up attacks on Kyiv came after it accused Ukraine on Thursday of wounding seven people and damaging about 100 residential buildings with airstrikes in Bryansk, a region bordering Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed hitting targets in Russia. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a Saturday strike on what Russia's Defense Ministry identified as an armored vehicle plant killed one person and wounded several. He advised residents who fled the city earlier in the war not to return. The Russian military also claimed Sunday to have destroyed Ukrainian air defense radars in the east, near Sievierodonetsk, as well as several ammunition depots elsewhere. Explosions were reported overnight in Kramatorsk, an eastern city where rockets killed at least 57 people at a train station crowded with civilians trying to evacuate before the expected Russian offensive. The ongoing siege and relentless bombardment of Mariupol has come at a terrible cost, with officials estimating Russians had killed at least 21,000 people. Just 120,000 people remain in the city, out of a prewar population of 450,000. Malyar, the deputy defense minister, said the Russians have continued to hit Mariupol with airstrikes and could be getting ready for an amphibious landing to beef up their ground forces. Capturing the city with a land area about half the size of Hong Kong's and home to a Sea of Azov port would also allow Russia to secure a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014. So far, tunnels at the sprawling Azovstal steel mill, which covers an area of more than 4.2 square miles, have allowed the defenders to hide and resist until they run out of ammunition. With Russia apparently poised to declare victory, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the city's fall could scuttle any attempt at a negotiated peace. ""The destruction of all our guys in Mariupol — what they are doing now — can put an end to any format of negotiations,"" Zelenskyy said in an interview with Ukrainian journalists. In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy called on the West to send more heavy weapons immediately if there is any chance of saving the city, adding Russia ""is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there."" Like Mariupol, the northeast city of Kharkiv has been an ongoing target of Russian aggression. Mayor Ihor Terekhov said three people were killed and 34 wounded Saturday. One explosion believed to have been caused by a missile sent rescue workers scrambling near an outdoor market. The workers said one person was killed and at least 18 wounded. Local officials said 10 people died in rocket attacks on residential areas of Kharkiv on Friday. Nate Mook, a member of the World Central Kitchen NGO run by celebrity chef José Andrés, said in a tweet that four workers in Kharkiv were wounded by a strike. Andrés tweeted that staff members were unnerved but safe. Zelenskyy estimated that 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops have died in the war, and about 10,000 have been wounded. The office of Ukraine's prosecutor general said Saturday that at least 200 children have been killed, and more than 360 wounded. Despite the war still raging, Zelenskyy spoke in his nightly address about Ukraine's plans for a memorial to honor the dead and the sacrifices of the Ukrainian people.

""The situation in Mariupol is both dire militarily and heartbreaking. The city doesn't exist anymore,"" Kuleba said in an interview with ""Face the Nation."" ""The remainings of the Ukrainian army and large group of civilians are basically encircled by the Russian forces. They continue their struggle, but it seems from the way the Russian army behaves in Mariupol, they decided to raze the city to the ground at any cost."" Russian troops have suffered a series of setbacks since President Vladimir Putin launched his war against Ukraine in late February, with his forces failing to take Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv and the Russian navy losing the flagship of its Black Sea fleet. Ukrainian security agents also captured Viktor Medvedchuk, an oligarch who was the Kremlin's main agent of influence in Kyiv, in another loss for Putin. Kuleba said that as a citizen of Ukraine, Medvedchuk will have ""all procedural rights."" ""His future will be decided as part of, on the one hand, legal process and on the other hand, the political process. We do not exclude any political options,"" he said. ""But as I said, we are a country of the rule of law. And first and foremost, he will face responsibility for the crimes he committed against Ukraine."" But Mariupol, a key port city for Ukraine, appeared on the brink of falling to Russian forces Sunday, which would give Moscow a land corridor to the Crimean peninsula. The Russian military estimated roughly 2,500 Ukrainian fighters are still at the Azovstal steel plant, providing a remaining pocket of resistance. Officials estimate roughly 21,000 have been killed by Russian troops in Mariupol, and 120,000 people are still in the city. Before the war, the city's population was 450,000. Echoing comments from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about possible talks with Russia, Kuleba said the fall of Mariupol could significantly hamper any negotiations. ""After Bucha, it became particularly difficult to continue talking with the Russians,"" he said, referring to atrocities against civilians committed by Russian troops in the city outside of Kyiv. ""But as my president mentioned, Mariupol may be a red line."" With Russia appearing to be nearing victory in Mariupol, Ukrainian officials are also preparing for intensified attacks in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have control of some territory. Kuleba said he also expects ""desperate attempts of the Russian forces … to finish with Mariupol at any cost,"" and for missile attacks on Kyiv and other cities to continue. To bolster Ukraine's defenses in the war, the U.S. has sent more than $2.6 billion in security aid, with President Biden last week approving an additional $800 million in weapons, ammunition and other equipment. The U.S. is also considering sending a high-level official to Kyiv as a show of support, though the White House has repeatedly said there are no plans for Mr. Biden to visit the country. Kuleba praised the president for the military aid that has been sent to Ukraine and said a visit by Mr. Biden would be an ""important message of support"" to the Ukrainians. ""A personal meeting between two presidents could also pave the way for new supplies and of U.S. weapons to Ukraine and also for discussions on the political- possible political settlement of this conflict,"" he said.",47,1.9230603483760282,6.041099150949432,-4.118038802573404,19
2022-04-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-cyberattacks-60-minutes-2022-04-17/,U.S. officials preparing for potential Russian cyberattacks,"This past week, the U.S. government issued an urgent warning about dangerous new malware that could cripple industrial systems worldwide. It comes on the heels of Ukraine withstanding an attempt by Russian hackers to knock out power to 2 million people in that war-torn country. The Biden administration has been releasing sensitive intelligence and dire warnings that the Kremlin is preparing to launch a new generation of cyberattacks on American soil. U.S. cyber defenders tell us they are now watching Russian state actors probe some of our most critical systems, and are bracing themselves — especially at the Department of Homeland Security — with an initiative called ""Shields Up."" Jen Easterly: We are seeing evolving intelligence about Russian planning for potential attacks. And we have to assume that there's going to be a breach. There's going to be an incident. There's going to be an attack. Jen Easterly is director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Known by its acronym, CISA, the agency helps secure computer networks in 16 sectors deemed vital to national security, like energy, finance and communications. Jen Easterly: Anything that could impact critical infrastructure. Easterly is not your typical bureaucrat. She's a decorated, retired Army officer with two Bronze Stars, who's also decorated with a tattoo, and nails painted the colors of Ukraine's flag – she's a techie with serious chops. A West Point graduate and a Rhodes scholar, she was part of the National Security Agency's elite hacking team and went on to help create the agency's cyber command. Bill Whitaker: When you've got someone like Vladimir Putin, who just doesn't seem to care about norms, how do you protect against that? When you've got someone like Vladimir Putin, who just doesn't seem to care about norms, how do you protect against that? Jen Easterly: I think we are dealing with a very dangerous, very sophisticated, very well-resourced cyber actor. And that's why we've been telling everybody consistently, shields up. What does that mean? It means assume there will be disruptive cyber activity and make sure you are prepared for it. She's taken to social media to encourage industry to share information with the government to defend against cyberattacks and calls on all Americans to put their shields up by updating software and using multi-factor authentication on computers and phones. Jen Easterly: I'm a big Star Trek fan, so ""Shields Up!"" And it has really caught on as something– that's all about preparation, not panic. Bill Whitaker: Is there one sector that worries you more than the others? Jen Easterly: We know that energy, targeting the energy sector, is part of the Russian play book. But also finance, given potential retaliatory attacks for the very severe sanctions that the U.S. and our allies have imposed and continue to impose. Bill Whitaker: If I'm just sitting at home watching this, why should I be concerned about a cyberattack? Jen Easterly: Everything that you do, hour by hour, is largely dependent in some way on the critical infrastructure. How you get gas at the local pump, how you get food at the grocery store, how you get money from your ATM, how you get your power, how you get your water, how you communicate – all of that is our critical infrastructure. And that's what we're saying is at potential risk to a Russian malicious cyberattack. Robert Lee: There's only been one country out there that's actually had expertise in taking down electric power systems and that's Russia. Robert Lee – another former NSA hacker – is the co-founder of Dragos, a cybersecurity company. He's known as a wizard of the dark arts of cyber war, specializing in the defense of critical infrastructure. In 2015 he investigated an incident in Ukraine, the most destructive cyberattack on civilian infrastructure the world had ever seen. Bill Whitaker: What– what'd you find? Robert Lee: The Russian state broke into three different power companies across Ukraine probably about six months ahead of the actual attack. So they broke in over the summer, got into position, and they started learning how to operate those systems. And as a result, they disconnected over 60 substations across Ukraine and caused blackouts for around 225,000 customers in the dead of winter. It was all done remotely from this building in Moscow by hackers with the military intelligence agency, the GRU. The Ukrainians had to send utility workers to the impaired substations to manually restart each one. A year later, Lee says, GRU hackers were back with a much more sophisticated attack – a piece of malware that could cripple multiple transmission stations with one keystroke. Bill Whitaker: What did it mean that Russia was able to do this? Robert Lee: It was a shock to everybody because there's been a lot of theory around how you could do this. People in my community on the cybersecurity side have been talking about this for a long time on it's possible. But to actually see it demonstrated is a giant proof that you can do it. And we also know now they're bold enough to do it. Bill Whitaker: Could the Russians do the same thing here in the U.S.? Robert Lee: Absolutely. Over the last few years, Lee's cybersecurity company, Dragos, has tracked the same GRU hacking group – known among researchers as ""Sandworm"" – installing malware and probing power companies here in the U.S. Robert Lee: There was about a dozen power companies that ended up getting compromised in the 2014-2015 time frame by the same group that ended up taking down the electric system in Ukraine. In the summer of 2017, Russian hackers launched a more brazen and potentially much more dangerous attack – this time on Petro Rabigh, a massive oil refinery along the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia. On a Friday night in August, a safety system triggered the whole plant to shut down. Julian Gutmanis was working cybersecurity for the Saudi oil giant Aramco and rushed to the scene to investigate. Bill Whitaker: From what you saw, you– you were alarmed? Julian Gutmanis: At that stage, yes, yep. Like, why is somebody going after the safety systems on a weekend at night? It's just not normal. What Gutmanis discovered stopped him in his tracks; someone had hacked into the emergency shutdown system and installed suspicious computer files. Julian Gutmanis: The files were created and executed– you know, momentarily before the– the initial outage that we responded to. Bill Whitaker: You were able to trace that back? Julian Gutmanis: Forensically, yeah. I came across a– function that they'd defined in there called ""execute exploit."" Hairs stood up on my arms and I'm like, ""This is probably something really serious."" You don't normally have the word ""exploit"" in– in normal kind of vendor software. Bill Whitaker: So that– that set off alarm bells? Julian Gutmanis: Oh, huge alarm bells. And it really kind of made us focus on, ""How did these files get there? Where did they come from? Who created them? And– and what do we do? What are they trying to do?"" Gutmanis now works for Robert Lee at Dragos, who also investigated the hack. Lee says the hackers could have set off explosions and released toxic chemicals with the malware they implanted, known as Triton. Robert Lee: It's the first time in history we've ever seen a cyberattack explicitly designed to kill people. It targets safety systems. And these safety systems are only there to protect lives. So going after that system explicitly, the only reason to do it is to hurt people. What happened is they made a small error in the software that instead of actually causing the effects they were looking to achieve, like an explosion where you'd kill people, instead it simply shut down the plant. Lisa Monaco: The Russians pose a serious and persistent threat. As the second highest ranking official in the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco oversees the FBI and its 1,000 strong cyber division. Three weeks ago, her department unsealed two secret indictments: one described how Triton worked, and identified Evgeny Gladkikh, from a Russian Ministry of Defense research institute, as one of the hackers. The second indictment says between 2012 and 2017 three Russian intelligence agents and accomplices hacked hundreds of energy companies around the world and managed to get inside the computer network at a nuclear power plant in Kansas. Lisa Monaco: This was historical activity. But it is very much the type of activity that we are warning about today when it comes to Russia's response to the world's response to the horror in Ukraine. Bill Whitaker: What about right now? Are you seeing Russian activity– Russian plots to disrupt our infrastructure? Lisa Monaco: We are seeing Russian state actors scanning, probing, looking for opportunities, looking for weaknesses in our systems on critical infrastructure, on businesses. Think of it, Bill, as a burglar going around trying to jiggle the lock in your house door to see if it's open. And we're seeing that. Earlier this month, Monaco joined Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray to announce the U.S. had conducted a bold operation: stopping Russian hackers as they were preparing to strike. Lisa Monaco: We're talking military intelligence actors, deploying malware, malicious code, on thousands of computers in hundreds of countries. We're seeing them deploy that code and take control of these computers. It's like an army of infected computers that, with a single command, can be deployed to do everything from gathering information, stealing information, and sometimes to have destructive effect. And we were able to work with the private sector to understand it, to be able to use unique investigative tools to trace it back to attackers at keyboards. And then, use our tools to go in, not only remove that malware, but again, to lock those doors, to keep the attacker from coming back. Dmitri Alperovitch: This was the first time that we have taken that action against something that the Russian military has done preemptively, before they launched the attack. We took it down. Dmitiri Alperovitch is well acquainted with Putin's tactics. As co-founder of the heavyweight cybersecurity company Crowdstrike, he helped trace the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee back to the GRU in Moscow. He currently is a member of the Homeland Security Advisory council. The Moscow-born Alperovitch has a theory why Putin hasn't launched a full scale cyberattack on the U.S. yet. Dmitri Alperovitch: He thinks that a victory that he can pull out is still achievable and that as he can make a deal with Europeans at least and possibly the Americans to take the sanctions off. I think he's mistaken on that. But I think at least until he tries that, he's unlikely to launch the cyberattacks. Bill Whitaker: So why do you think President Biden has said a cyberattack from Russia is coming. Dmitri Alperovitch: Well, I think the reality is that those sanctions will not come off, that the economic pressure on Russia will continue, and they are gonna start retaliating for that in cyberspace once it hits them that this is permanent, that this is not going away. And they're gonna try to look for ways to press us economically in retaliation. And cyber is a perfect way for them to do so. Perfect because cyber is a battlefield where Russians have an advantage: a target-rich environment in the United States. Dmitri Alperovitch: The reality is that we have way too many targets. If you look particularly in our energy sector, you have regional utilities. You have minor energy processing companies, storage companies, pipeline companies. And make no mistake, Bill. The cyber actors that they have are top notch. And they've demonstrated that time and time again. Bill Whitaker: We have said in the past that if you do this to us, we will respond in kind. Would we? Dmitri Alperovitch: We have to let him know that you will not touch our critical infrastructure without a response. And the way to do that, I think, is through a cyber operation that can demonstrate our capabilities without lasting damage. One of the ways you can do that, for example, is by taking Russia off the internet for a few hours. It won't cause any lasting impact, but it will demonstrate the power of the United States Cyber Command, what we can do to his economy by disconnecting him, effectively, from the internet. Bill Whitaker: We can do that? Dmitri Alperovitch: We can absolutely do that. And we'll let him know that if he keeps going, if he keeps attacking us, we can make that permanent.

2022-04-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/ukraine-war-prompts-new-u-s-army-readiness-training-exercises-in-california-desert/,Ukraine War Prompts New U.S. Army Readiness-Training Exercises in California Desert,"FORT IRWIN, Calif. (AP) -- In the dusty California desert, U.S. Army trainers are already using lessons learned from Russia's war against Ukraine as they prepare soldiers for future fights against a major adversary such as Russia or China. The role-players in this month's exercise at the National Training Center speak Russian. The enemy force that controls the fictional town of Ujen is using a steady stream of social media posts to make false accusations against the American brigade preparing to attack. In the coming weeks, the planned training scenario for the next brigade coming in will focus on how to battle an enemy willing to destroy a city with rocket and missile fire in order to conquer it. If the images seem familiar, they are, playing out on televisions and websites worldwide right now as Russian forces pound Ukrainian cities with airstrikes, killing scores of civilians. The information war on social media has showcased impassioned nightly speeches by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Russian efforts to accuse Ukraine's forces of faking mass killings in towns such as Bucha — massacres that the West blames on Moscow's troops. ""I think right now the whole Army is really looking at what's happening in Ukraine and trying to learn lessons,"" said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth. Those lessons, she said, range from Russia's equipment and logistics troubles to communications and use of the internet. ""The Russia-Ukraine experience is a very powerful illustration for our Army of how important the information domain is going to be,"" said Wormuth, who spent two days at the training center in the Mojave Desert watching an Army brigade wage war against the fictional ""Denovian"" forces. ""We've been talking about that for about five years. But really seeing it and seeing the way Zelenskyy has been incredibly powerful. ... This is a world war that the actual world can see and watch in real time. "" At the center, the commander, Brig. Gen. Curt Taylor, and his staff have ripped pages out of the Russian playbook to ensure that U.S. soldiers are ready to fight and win against a sophisticated near-peer enemy. It's a common tool. For example, his base and the Joint Readiness Training Center in Louisiana both shifted to counterinsurgency training during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. And the military services have focused other training on how to fight in cold weather -- mimicking conditions in Russia or North Korea. But these latest changes have happened quickly in the early months after Russia invaded Ukraine. About 4,500 soldiers from 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Texas, are out in the vast desert training area at Fort Irwin, where they will spend two weeks fighting the NTC's resident 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which acts as the enemy military. Soldiers from the regiment -- known as Blackhorse -- are arrayed in and around Ujen, which also includes role-players acting as the locals. As the sun was rising earlier this past week, Army Col. Ian Palmer, the brigade commander, stood on Crash Hill, on the outskirts of the town, preparing his soldiers to launch an attack. Lines of tanks spread out in the distance. Heavy winds the night before hampered his progress, so the attack was a bit behind. He said the exercise is using more drones by the friendly and enemy forces, both for surveillance and attacks. So his forces are trying to use camouflage and tuck into the terrain to stay out of sight. ""You know if you can be seen, you can be shot, where ever you are,"" he said. Down in the makeshift town, the opposition forces are confident they can hold off Palmer's brigade despite the size difference. The Denovians only have about 1,350 forces but they are throwing everything they have at the brigade, from jamming and other electronic warfare to insurgency attacks and propaganda. The role-players have their phones ready to film and post quickly to social media. The Denovian forces want to portray the unit in the worst possible light, said Taylor, and constantly twist the narrative on social media so Palmer's troops realize they are in a battle for the truth. That's a challenge, he said, because ""when I've got a bunch of casualties and I'm getting overrun on my left flank and my supply trains aren't where they need to be and I can't find the bulldozers, it's hard to think about something that someone said about me on Twitter."" The training goal, said Taylor, is teaching the brigades that come in how to fuse all elements of their combat power into a coordinated assault. ""Everyone can play an instrument but it's about making music -- bringing it all together in a synchronized fashion. And what you saw today was the artillery was doing the artillery thing, the aviation was doing the aviation thing and the maneuver guys were doing the maneuver thing. But part of the delay in their assault on the town was they couldn't synchronize those three,"" he said. Again, they can look to Ukraine to see how Russia failed to do that in the early weeks of the war. U.S. leaders repeatedly noted that in Russia's initial multipronged assault in Ukraine, commanders consistently failed to provide the airstrikes and support their ground troops needed to move into key cities such as Kyiv. That failure led to Russian troops bombing the cities from the outskirts, hitting hospitals, apartment buildings and other structures and killing civilians. So when the next brigade arrives as the training center, Taylor said it will face an enemy on board with doing just that. ""We will be very focused on how to fight against an adversary that is willing to destroy infrastructure because that's how we think our adversaries will fight,"" Taylor said. ""We've got to be prepared for urban combat where we have an adversary that is indiscriminately firing artillery."" Wormuth, the Army secretary, said seeing the training also underscored other lessons the U.S. is taking from the war in Ukraine. ""As we're watching what's happening to the Russians now, it's informative for us to think about what is right, from a modernization standpoint,"" she said, noting that some U.S. tanks are very heavy and the terrain in Europe is muddier, not like the hard-packed sand of the desert. The Army, she said, has to determine ""what's the right balance between the mobility of a tank, the survivability of a tank and the lethality of a tank? If you want to make it more mobile, you make it lighter, but that makes it less survivable. And so you have to decide where you're going to take risks."" © Copyright 2022 Associated Press.

2022-04-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kyiv-ukraine-russia-attack-moskva-sink/,Russia warns of further attacks on Kyiv after sinking of flagship Moskva warship,"Russia's defense ministry warned Friday that Moscow would intensify its missile attacks on Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv, one day after Russia's flagship military vessel, the Moskva, sank in the Black Sea due to what Ukraine claimed was a Ukrainian missile strike. Russia said the symbolically important ship sank because of a fire. Moscow said it would intensify strikes around Kyiv in retaliation for what it called Ukrainian ""terrorist attacks"" or ""sabotage"" on Russian territory. On Thursday, it accused Ukraine of carrying out attacks on Russian border areas. In response, Ukraine's security services published audio it alleged was an intercepted phone call in which a Russian serviceman said Russian forces had carried out the attacks themselves. Neither the Russian nor the Ukrainian reports could be independently verified. The Kyiv area was hit Friday by some of the most powerful explosions heard in two weeks, and Russia said it had targeted a Ukrainian missile plant. A renewed bombardment of the capital city itself could return residents to a heightened state of caution, after Russia's pullback from the area to refocus its attack on the eastern Donbas region. Evidence of Russian atrocities continued to be collected by authorities around Kyiv from areas that had been occupied by Russian forces. Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova, told CBS News' Tony Dokoupil earlier this week that her department was investigating at least 6,000 cases of war crimes. ""It's very important to collect all evidence and to find all possibilities to work with international partners for all future proceedings in the court,"" she said. Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko took CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livesay to the village of Havronschyna, where a family of five was allegedly gunned down as they tried to flee. The youngest was only two years old. A stroller could be seen in the family's burned out car, as well as snacks like apples and granola bars. ""I have son. My own son is three years old. It's so hard,"" Honcharenko said. Local farmer Yuriy Patsan said he witnessed a Russian armored vehicle open fire on the family car with high-caliber explosive rounds, even though the car had a sign in the back window that read ""children."" He said he tried to save the family, but they died in his arms. ""All I could do was bury them. We're not dogs like the Russian soldiers,"" Patsan said. Once the Russians left the area, Patsan and the Ukrainian police exhumed the bodies for investigation. ""It's definitely a war crime, because without any reason, civilians were killed,"" said Honrachenko. ""The world should know that it is not fake. The world should know who is Russian regime. Who is Putin.""",45,4.94726883096091,3.185099372814046,1.762169458146864,19
2022-04-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-crimes-ukraine-cia-director-william-burns-china/,"CIA Director William Burns decries Russia's ""horrific"" crimes in Ukraine, calls out China as ""silent partner in Putin's aggression""","CIA Director William Burns on Thursday decried ""horrific"" crimes committed by Russian forces in Bucha and throughout Ukraine, warning that subsequent phases of the war, soon to enter its eighth week, would involve continued bloodshed. ""The last chapter in Putin's war has yet to be written, as he grinds away in Ukraine,"" Burns said in prepared public remarks to mark his first year in office. ""I have no doubt about the cruel pain and damage that Putin can continue to inflict on Ukraine, or the raw brutality with which Russian force is being applied."" Speaking to students and faculty at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Burns called China, led by President Xi Jinping, ""a silent partner in Putin's aggression"" and said it posed the ""greatest challenge"" confronting the U.S. and ""the most profound test that CIA has ever faced."" In his remarks, Burns described several broad challenges the agency would have to address in what he called a ""new era"" — characterized, he said, by an increasingly adversarial China, a ""pugnacious and revisionist"" Russia, and other mounting technological, climate and global health threats. ""CIA will have to reimagine itself to compete successfully in this new age,"" he said. A career diplomat who previously served as U.S. ambassador to Russia, Burns spoke at length about the ""immediate"" threat posed by the Kremlin's aggression, and called Russian President Vladimir Putin an ""apostle of payback"" whose appetite for risk has grown as his circle of trusted advisers has shrunk over the years. ""Every day, Putin demonstrates that declining powers can be at least as disruptive as rising ones,"" he said. Burns recounted how he came away ""troubled"" from an interaction with Putin in November, when President Biden dispatched the CIA chief to Moscow to warn the Russians of the consequences of potential military action in Ukraine. ""While it did not yet seem that he had made an irreversible decision to invade Ukraine, Putin was defiantly leaning in that direction, apparently concerned that his window was closing for shaping Ukraine's orientation,"" Burns said. He said Putin appeared convinced at the time that the Ukrainians would quickly submit; that his own military could achieve victory ""at minimal cost;"" that Europeans would remain ""risk-averse"" and that his own economy was ""sanctions-proofed"" by massive foreign currency reserves. ""When he launched his war seven weeks ago, Putin was proven wrong on each of those counts,"" Burns said. He said scenes in Mariupol and Kharkiv, under weeks-long assault by the Russians, were ""sadly reminiscent"" of images he witnessed in Grozny, Chechnya, as a young diplomat in the winter of 1994. ""But Ukrainian will is unbroken, and Putin's Russia has inflicted massive material and reputational damage on itself,"" he said. Burns extolled what he said was the largely unseen work of U.S. intelligence officers and repeatedly lauded the effects of the Biden administration's policy of publicly releasing declassified intelligence about Russia's plans, which he said had ""paid off in some important ways."" ""By being open with some of our secrets, we made it harder for Putin to obscure the truth of his unprovoked and vicious aggression,"" Burns said, adding that the success of the strategy reflected the need for ""new thinking and new tactics"" in a uniquely demanding era for intelligence. Last week, the intelligence community broadened the scope of the intelligence it was sharing with Ukraine to reflect changing tactical realities and address a looming Russian offensive in the east and south of the country, according to U.S. officials. ""We are intensely sharing timely intelligence with the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves throughout their country, including in areas held by Russia before the 2022 invasion,"" a U.S. intelligence official told CBS News. Burns said during a question-and-answer session Thursday that earlier ""rhetorical posturing"" by the Kremlin about the potential use of nuclear weapons had not, to date, been matched by ""practical evidence"" of deployments or military dispositions, but said the CIA would ""watch for that very intently."" He also said the agency would boost the resources it dedicated to China, which, he said, sought to overtake the U.S. ""in literally every domain."" He said the CIA aimed to ""double"" the number of its Mandarin-speaking officers and increase overseas posts focused on Beijing. ""Nothing will matter more to our long-term success as an intelligence agency than how well we compete with the [People's Republic of China] and how well we organize ourselves for that competition over the next few years,"" Burns said.",20,5.088202433427714,4.790903561801263,0.29729887162645063,18

Nine-year-old Galia penned the note inside what appears to be a day planner to her mother, who died in Borodyanka. A photo of the note was shared on Twitter by Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs. Galia wrote the letter on March 8, less than two weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the deadly attack. ""Mum, this letter is your present,"" she wrote. ""...If you think that you nurtured me for no reason, you are not right. Thank you for the 9 years of my life. Thank you so much for my childhood. You are the best mother in the world! I will never forget you! I wish you happiness in heaven. I wish you to go to heaven. We will meet in heaven. I will try to behave myself to go to heaven. Kissing you."" Gerashchenko said that the little girl's mother died in Borodyanka, a Ukrainian city that has been facing horrific conditions since Russian troops invaded. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that the situation there is even worse than those in its neighboring city of Bucha, where horrific images have surfaced of slaughtered civilians. Last Thursday, investigators found 26 bodies among rubble in Borodyanka. Ukrainian troops were able to recently regain control over the city from Russian troops, according to Reuters. As of Monday, local rescuers were still attempting to find missing residents. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said that ""tens of thousands of people have already been killed"" in Ukraine. ""Russian army uses all types of artillery, all types of missiles, aerial bombs, including phosphorus bombs and other ammunition banned by the international law,"" he said in a video address. ""This is an obvious terror of the civilians.

2022-04-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/egypt-tourist-bus-crash-10-killed/,"Tourist bus collides with truck in Egypt and bursts into flames, killing 10 people","A tourist bus collided with a truck on a highway in southern Egypt and burst into flames on Wednesday, killing at least 10 people including four French and a Belgian, authorities said. The crash happened some 34 miles south of the ancient city of Luxor, as it was travelling to the temples of Esna on the west bank of the Nile River, provincial authorities said in a statement. Along with the tourists, five Egyptians were killed in the crash. At least 14 others were injured, including eight from France and six from Belgium, they said. They had ""broken bones, bruises and superficial injuries"" but all were in a stable condition, the governor of the southern province of Aswan said, AFP reported. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Footage that circulated online showed a tourist bus in flames with people trying to put out the fire. ""A guest is dying inside,"" one person was heard screaming. The bus in the video bore the logo of state-owned Misr Travel. The Cairo-based agency did not respond to a request for comment. Aswan Provincial Governor Ashraf Attia said the injured were taken to hospitals and were in stable condition. Wednesday's accident came five days after a bus crashed on a highway near the Red Sea, killing three including two Polish tourists. Deadly traffic accidents claim thousands of lives every year in Egypt, which has a poor transportation safety record. The crashes and collisions are mostly caused by speeding, bad roads or poor enforcement of traffic laws. Egypt's official statistics agency says there were around 10,000 road accidents in 2019, the most recent year for which statistics are available, leaving over 3,480 dead. In 2018, there were 8,480 car accidents, causing over 3,080 deaths. Egypt had begun reviving its vital tourism industry by promoting its ancient heritage, after the country's 2011 revolution and ensuing unrest struck the sector. But the arrival of the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the subsequent global travel bans resulted in a plunge in tourism revenues to $4 billion, from $13 billion the previous year. The sector employs some two million people in a country of 103 million and generates more than 10 percent of GDP. In August 2021, Russia resumed flights to Egyptian resorts six years after a Russian airliner crashed after taking off from Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all 224 people on board. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has yet again cut off much of the flow of tourists to Egypt, as the two countries accounted for about 40 percent of visitors prior to the war. The current administration of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has invested heavily in promoting tourism, having organized major events in a bid to attract visitors. Last April, the North African country staged a procession of floats carrying the mummified remains of 22 pharaohs, including Egypt's most powerful ancient queen, to a new resting place in Cairo. And in November, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities held a grand ceremony to mark the reopening of the ancient Avenue of Sphinxes in the city of Luxor. Since last year, visitors from dozens of additional countries have been permitted to obtain visas on arrival to Egypt, than applying in advance. While attacks on tourists have largely ceased since they peaked in the 1990s, deadly incidents have occurred. In September 2015, eight Mexicans were mistakenly killed by security forces in the vast Western Desert. And in February 2019, a German woman and two Egyptian children were killed when a building collapsed in a residential neighborhood of the southern city of Luxor.

2022-04-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-javelins-russia/,See how the U.S. is shipping javelins to Ukraine,"Since the Russian invasion began, the U.S. has committed more than $2.5 billion worth of weapons and other military equipment to Ukraine. In a phone call Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Biden pledged an additional $800 million in weapons, ammunition and security assistance. CBS News was given an exclusive look at a shipment of U.S. military weapons bound for the battlefield. The weapons arrive at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware in unmarked trucks driven from ammunition dumps located all over the United States. Hundreds of javelin anti-tank missiles — weapons that are destroying Russian tanks — are then loaded aboard a cargo aircraft bound for the battlefield in Ukraine. ""Our goal is to be agile and to move the requirements quickly so the folks on the other end do not have to wait for the material,"" Colonel Bary Flack, the commander of the maintenance group at Dover Air Force Base, told CBS News. ""The hazards are it's a high explosive. These are javelin missiles."" The plane took off Wednesday afternoon and should be arriving overnight in Poland, where the weapons will be handed over to the Ukrainian military. Ukraine may not be a member of NATO, but Ukrainian officers are working directly with NATO to get weapons into the hands of their soldiers. ""They are in contact with senior leaders in Ukraine, which includes the chief of defense and ministers of defense, and are prioritizing their requirements based on usage rates and what they see on the ground,"" Rear Admiral Duke Heinz, the director of logistics at U.S. European Command, told CBS News. The Ukrainians may be outfighting the Russians, but they still need more firepower to counter the buildup of Russian forces in the east and to somehow stop the merciless bombardment of cities. ""We are in it to win,"" Heinz said. ""It's the top priority.""",49,4.99438892980381,4.327546464766468,0.6668424650373419,22
2022-04-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-rape-allegations-russian-occupied-areas/,"Rape ""happening systematically"" in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, Ukrainian lawmaker Kira Rudyk says","As Russian troops retreated from areas around Kyiv, officials, aid workers and journalists received reports from local residents that soldiers had raped them. A Ukrainian lawmaker said that sexual violence is ""systematic in all the areas that were occupied by the Russians."" ""Rape is used as a tool of war in Ukraine to break our spirits, to humiliate us and to show us that we can be helpless to protect our women and children and their bodies,"" Kira Rudyk, a member of Ukraine's Parliament, told CBS News. ""It is happening systematically in the occupied territories."" Rudyk has been gathering evidence and testimonials in the hope that the perpetrators will eventually face justice. ""At first, we were working on making sure that women are safe and receive medical help. And I can tell you that some of them were indeed pregnant of Russian soldiers who raped them,"" Rudyk said. She visited Bucha shortly after Russian troops left, and once people's immediate medical needs were attended to, she said she used a combination of phone records and documents that were left behind ""to get the names and last names of the soldiers who were committing those crimes… We are right now collecting more and more evidence and information about them."" Horrifying accounts of sexual violence and rape have been reported from areas which had been previously occupied by Russian forces as they pull back to refocus their attack on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. The full the scale of the atrocities is not and may never be known. Rudyk heard a story of a women being raped in front of her family members, as well as one of a woman being repeatedly visited and raped over many days. ""I wish he had killed me instead of what he did,"" 83-year-old retired school teacher Vera told CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams, who visited the small village in southern Ukraine where she lives shortly after the Russian soldiers who had been occupying it left. Visibly distressed, Vera said that a Russian fighter from Donetsk had raped her in her house with her disabled husband in the next room. ""I asked [the soldier], 'What do you have against our government? We weren't the ones who started the war.' God, I wish I hadn't said that. I tempted fate. He said I was too smart,"" Vera told CBS News. ""He said get up. I got up. He grabbed me by the back of the neck. He squeezed it. I started to choke. I couldn't breathe. He asked me who was in the house. I said only my sick old man, no one else… and then it started."" Vera said the police told her that two other women in her small village had also been raped — another retiree and a younger woman — and that there was a similar case in a neighboring town that had also been occupied. Vera said that, even though the occupiers had left her village, she was still petrified every night. ""I'm sad. Everything hurts. I'm in a state where I'm neither dead nor alive."" Under international law, rape during conflict can be a war crime, a crime against humanity and — when linked with the intent to eliminate a group — part of genocide. Rudyk said Russian forces used rape as a tool to terrorize people, because Ukrainians were putting up such fierce resistance to the invasion. ""They're trying to figure out ways to break us. Well, it's not working right now. It's just making us angry and bringing more and more people wanting to fight, wanting to protect our peaceful cities from this atrocity,"" she said. Rudyk said she didn't believe Russian troops had been ordered to rape Ukrainian women, ""but they were told to do whatever they want, which is basically allowing them to do that."" Aid organizations are working to help send rape kits and emergency contraception to Ukraine to attend to immediate medical needs and facilitate the collection of evidence. On Wednesday, the United Nations announced a set of global guidelines on how to collect evidence from witnesses, victims and survivors of sexual violence in conflict zones. Rudyk said, although she hopes her work will help justice be served, sexual violence as a tool of war will continue as long as the conflict does. ""The only way to stop the atrocities is to end the war,"" she said. ""And every single time, when a world organization is gathering and saying, 'Ok, we will get [together] in two weeks and reconsider what's happening, and we will think, maybe we will take some actions,' I want you to think that there is probably a woman somewhere in occupied territory — and not [just] one — that for these two weeks would be waking up every single day knowing what would happen. There will be Russian soldiers coming in and raping her. And she may not survive."" Justine Redman and Pamela Falk contributed to this report.

The latest package of assistance will contain new capabilities for Ukraine including artillery systems, artillery rounds and armored personnel carriers, Mr. Biden said in a statement. The president has also approved the transfer of additional helicopters, he said. ""The steady supply of weapons the United States and its allies and partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its fight against the Russian invasion. It has helped ensure that Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine,"" Mr. Biden said. ""We cannot rest now."" The president spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for nearly an hour earlier Wednesday, during which he informed his Ukrainian counterpart of the additional $800 million, Mr. Biden said. ""The Ukrainian military has used the weapons we are providing to devastating effect,"" the president said. ""As Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region, the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself."" The U.S. is also expanding the scope of intelligence it is sharing with Ukraine to be responsive to the changing tactical situation on the ground, U.S. officials said, as Russian forces reposition themselves in the south and east of the country. The Biden administration has warned Russia is preparing to launch new offensive operations in the Donbas region, which Russian-backed forces first occupied in 2014. An official familiar with the intelligence-sharing arrangements said the effort to date had been effective both in helping Ukrainian forces identify specific Russian targets and to protect and secure Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and surrounding areas. The new guidance, issued late last week, will ensure similar assistance continues in contested areas of the country. ""As the conflict evolves, we continue to adjust to ensure that operators have the flexibility to share detailed, timely intelligence with the Ukrainians,"" a U.S. intelligence official said Wednesday. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the increased intelligence sharing. While Russian forces have retreated from Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, Zelenskyy has warned the war launched by Russia in late February is entering a new phase, and evidence that Russian troops committed atrocities against civilians has continued to mount. CBS News found evidence of mass graves and bodies in the streets of Bucha, a city outside of Kyiv, earlier this month after Russian troops left the area. The atrocities prompted global outcry, with Mr. Biden calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" last week and accusing him of committing ""genocide"" on Tuesday during a visit to Iowa. After suffering setbacks in parts of Ukraine and failing to seize the capital, Putin on Tuesday said Russian troops will turn their attention to the country's eastern Donbas region. The Russian president vowed his ""military operation will continue until its full completion."" The U.S. has provided Ukraine with more than $2.6 billion in military aid since the beginning of Russia's invasion, committing more than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 5,000 Javelin anti-armor systems and hundreds of Switchblade drones, among other equipment and weapons, according to the Defense Department. The latest package of security assistance authorized by Mr. Biden includes an additional 300 Switchblade drones, 500 Javelin missiles, air surveillance radars, 11 Mi17 helicopters, 18 155mm howitzers and other military equipment, the Pentagon said. Zelenskyy has pleaded with the U.S. and European allies to provide the country with additional heavy weapons such as armored vehicles, air defense systems and military aircraft, warning that failing to do so will result in further bloodshed and destruction.

The cyberattack, which Russia's military spy agency originally planned for Friday evening, appears to have fallen short of cutting off power. The Ukrainian government's computer emergency response team said it was able to stop the hackers from ""carrying out [their] malicious intent.""Top Ukrainian cyber official Victor Zhora said the attack was ""effectively rebuffed."" According to cyber researchers, the hacking group, which the Justice Department has previously linked to GRU Russian military intelligence, used damaging malware known as ""Industroyer ICS,"" which is designed to disrupt civilian electrical supply by targeting high-voltage electrical substations, according to cybersecurity firm ESET. This was the work of ""military IT hackers from the Russian Federation,"" Zhora said, and the investigation is ongoing. The malware ""was empowered to send commands to the switchers,"" Zhora explained, noting the malicious code was more sophisticated than the version deployed during the NotPetya attack. Russian-backed hackers tried to cover their tracks by deploying CaddyWiper and other data-wiping malware after the intrusion. For years, Russia-backed hackers have tested their cyber weapons on Ukraine. The 2017 NotPetya attack by the GRU, deployed the same tactics as the 2020 SolarWinds attack that compromised nine U.S. government agencies and scores of American companies, sabotaging a widely-used piece of software to break into thousands of Ukraine's networks. CISA Director Jen Easterly tweeted Tuesday that the agency is working closely with Ukrainian officials to understand the incident and relay relevant information to U.S. infrastructure partners. The Sandworm hacking group has succeeded in cutting power to parts of Ukraine in the past, in 2015 and 2016. ""Proud of Ukrainian cyber defenders and ESET this morning,"" John Hultquist, vice president of intelligence analysis at Mandiant tweeted Tuesday. ""This is a big win against a determined adversary. You're setting the standard for defenders."" Ukrainian officials said they first learned of the intrusion on April 7, the eve of the planned attack on April 8. Ukrainian officials declined to say which specific energy company or facilities had been targeted. ""The name of the facility cannot be put into public domain,"" Zhora said. But he added that the cyber attack ""was supposed to inflict serious damages and consequences both for the staff of the facility who were renovating and renewing the electricity supplies of the facilities [targeted] and for the ordinary customers coming back home."" Since the hackers planned to launch their attack on Friday evening, Ukrainian officials speculated that any outage could have affected Ukrainians who ""were looking to television to know what was going on in the country, the news from the front line."" While this incident failed to cause any electricity outages, Zhora noted the malware code ""has been successful at getting into the management technological system."" He added, ""There were some disruptions at one of the components in the system, but we detected it immediately and fixed it."" The attack did impact a few networks within one company. Investigators are continuing to check ""to see if remnants of codes are in other energy facilities,"" in an effort to prevent similar attacks. Ukraine's computer security team indicated in a Facebook post Tuesday that the targeted organization ""suffered two waves of attacks."" The first compromise occurred ""no later than February 2022,"" and ""the power outage and the removal of the company's infrastructure were scheduled for Friday evening, April 8, 2022,"" but ""at the moment has been prevented."" Ukrainian officials stressed that despite the seriousness of this attack, the onslaught isn't new. ""We are dealing with an opponent that has been constantly draining us for eight years in the cyber space, drilling us since 2014.

He spoke as unverified reports on social media alleged that Russian forces might have used chemical weapons in the besieged port city of Mariupol. ""If they were used, the Prime Minister, the President of the United States, the President of France and other world leaders have all been clear that that crosses a line and that all options are on the table for how we would respond,"" James Heappey told CBS News partner network BBC News. On Monday, Ukraine's far-right Azov brigade, which was incorporated into the country's security forces several years ago, claimed a Russian drone had dropped a ""poisonous substance"" in Mariupol, and that people were experiencing neurological problems and respiratory failure. ""Three people have clear signs of poisoning by warfare chemicals, but without catastrophic consequences,"" the battalion's founder, Andrei Biletsky, said on social media. Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Malyar said the reports were being investigated. ""I can suggest that that was the phosphorus munitions, perhaps. The final and confirmed information will come later. But we have to understand that the risk of using chemical weaponry exists and is quite high,"" Maylar said on Ukrainian television. A U.S. senior defense official said Tuesday that - though not confirmed - the reports were being taken seriously, given Russia's history of using chemical weapons, and that the situation was being monitored. ""We are aware of social media reports which claim Russian forces deployed a potential chemical munition in Mariupol,"" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said in a statement late Monday. ""We cannot confirm at this time and will continue to monitor the situation closely. These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia's potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine."" Heappey, Britain's armed forces minister, stressed that there could be a number of responses from the West. ""It's important to have some ambiguity, and it's also not for any government minister from an individual country to pledge NATO involvement,"" Heappey said. ""It's perfectly possible that a response to chemical weapons use could happen without NATO. But all options being on the table is meant as a very clear deterrent to President Putin from using these weapons that are utterly appalling, cause huge suffering and misery, are completely indiscriminate and won't just affect troops — not that that's not bad enough — but could well affect women, children, civilians."" Military analysts say Russia's war in Ukraine has been marked by ineptitude and a lack of professionalism. Over the weekend, it seemed Moscow was trying to fix that problem. President Vladimir Putin's military — already accused of committing myriad war crimes in its failed attempt to capture the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv — put General Alexander Dvornikov in charge of the ongoing invasion, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Monday. Dvornikov previously led Russia's forces in Syria, where the United Nations accused them of committing war crimes including airstrikes targeting civilian areas and infrastructure. Under Dvornikov's command, Russia is switching its focus to eastern Ukraine's Donbas regions, where Ukrainian forces have already been fighting Russian-backed separatists for eight years. Just a few days ago a column of Russian vehicles at least eight miles long was spotted heading for the region. Mariupol is a vital port, and one of the biggest cities in Donbas. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said Monday that tens of thousands of Ukrainians were thought to have been killed in Mariupol alone after weeks of relentless Russian bombardment.

Now, it seems Moscow is trying to fix that problem. President Vladimir Putin's military — accused of committing war crimes in its failed attempt to capture the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv — has put General Alexander Dvornikov in charge of Russia's invasion, according to a U.S. official. Dvornikov previously led Russia's forces in Syria, where the United Nations accused them of committing war crimes including airstrikes targeting civilian areas and infrastructure. The commander's appointment to take over Russian operations in Ukraine comes after a catalogue of military failures. Russian forces were defeated in the battle for Kyiv and have withdrawn from around the capital city. The security situation in Kyiv has improved so dramatically that on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky walked through the middle of the city with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""We simply wish to keep on supporting the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Johnson said. His mere presence in the heavily fortified capital was a powerful message. Ukrainian officials claim nearly 20,000 Russian troops have been killed in the country since Putin launched his invasion on February 24. The Kremlin admits to only a small fraction of those losses, but plenty of videos have shown Russia's tanks and armored vehicles being picked off by Ukrainian forces — with everything from advanced anti-tank missiles from the U.S., to Molotov cocktails. Now, under the command of Dvornikov, Russia is switching its focus to eastern Ukraine's Donbas regions, where Ukrainian forces have already been fighting against Russian-backed separatists for eight years. Just a few days ago a column of Russian vehicles at least eight miles long was spotted heading for the region. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed onslaught in Donbas, and with Dvornikov's brutal history of levelling Syrian cities to quash resistance, and Russia's recent record of pummeling southern Ukrainian towns from afar, there's every reason to fear a new wave of attacks on civilians. President Zelenskyy said Monday that tens of thousands of Ukrainians were thought to have been killed in the port city of Mariupol alone after weeks of relentless Russian bombardment.

2022-04-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pursuing-vladimir-putin-for-war-crimes/,What are the prospects for pursuing Vladimir Putin for war crimes?,"More than 50 innocent people trying to flee the fighting in eastern Ukraine were killed Friday in a Russian missile attack on a crowded train station in Kramatorsk. Among the first responders: investigators gathering evidence to determine if this is a war crime. War is full of unspeakable violence, and civilians always suffer. But it is a crime to kill civilians on purpose. ""We're seeing a pattern of deliberate attacks against civilians,"" said Ambassador Beth Van Schaack, the State Department official in charge of assembling evidence that could prove Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine. Every day, it seems, there is another crime scene to investigate. Some of them encompass entire cities, where residents are being relentlessly bombarded by the Russians. ""I think the Mariupol theater attack is really emblematic of that,"" said Van Schaack. ""Obviously civilian, full of individuals who were sheltering from the war around them, and it gets deliberately targeted by Russia's forces."" CBS News national security correspondent David Martin asked, ""How do you distinguish between a war crime and just atrociously bad behavior?"" ""What we need to do is focus on deliberate attacks against civilians, or indiscriminate attacks against civilians,"" Van Schaack replied. ""Those are clear war crimes. There's no fog of war here, right? If you look at a map, for example, of Mariupol, you can see where the military objectives might be, which would be appropriate targets for a military campaign – and then you see where the actual strikes were happening."" Then there are the streets of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, where atrocities were committed by Russian forces. ""Individuals who clearly were in custody with their hands tied [were] shot execution-style, left in basements, left in fields,"" said Van Schaack. ""This is not just shells coming from miles and miles away. This is close-range violence committed by, at the hands of, Russia's forces."" Martin asked, ""Have you seen any evidence that the Russians are actually trying to cover up crimes?"" ""Chillingly, less of that than you might expect,"" Van Schaack replied. ""Bodies are being left in the street. They seem to be doing this in an unbelievably brazen way. That's really shocking."" ""Who do you go after first? The perpetrator who pulled the trigger? The commander of the troops? Or the leaders back in Moscow?"" ""Frankly, the answer is all of the above,"" she replied. ""But you're always looking to go up the chain of command to the architects of this terrible violence."" Justice Richard Goldstone, the chief prosecutor of war crimes committed in Bosnia in the 1990s, said that in the case of Ukraine, the key will be establishing a pattern: ""A prosecutor could go very quickly to the more senior ranks because of the mass of evidence that is available,"" he said. ""If Bucha is an exception, it may be difficult to put it at the door of President Putin, or of his senior generals. But if what we're seeing in Bucha is repeated in one village after the other, that's not coincidence. There obviously is an order for that system to be carried out."" It took years to investigate Bosnia, but the president of Serbia himself, a dictator named Slobodan Milošević, ultimately ended up in the dock at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Goldstone said, ""President Milošević, in his wildest dreams, never thought he'd be standing trial in the Hague. But there was a revolution in his country, and he was kicked out, and he was put on a plane and bundled off to the Hague."" Milošević, who died in prison before a verdict could be reached, was small fry compared to Vladimir Putin, who President Biden says should be tried as a war criminal. ""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Mr. Biden said Monday. ""He is a war criminal."" Martin asked Van Schaack, ""How do you make a case against Putin?"" ""Because he is essentially an autocrat with complete control over the apparatus of the Russian state and the Russian military, it's actually a much easier case than we've seen in some other situations,"" she replied. ""Do you need some kind of verbal direction that he gave to his commanders?"" ""Even without the so-called smoking gun order, there is still this idea of command responsibility – that the images are so stark, it's so clear that his troops are running amok, terrorizing the civilian population within Ukraine,"" Van Schaack said. Martin asked Goldstone, ""Have you heard anything Putin has said to date that could be used against him as evidence of a war crime?"" ""It's more what he hasn't said, I think, that's important,"" he replied. ""He must know the facts from watching his own television screen, and if he hasn't taken steps to stop it, that would make him guilty of a war crime."" Van Schaack said she believes Putin will be indicted, adding, ""I'm not sure whether he'll be in custody."" Goldstone said, ""If President Putin remains in power and remains in Russia, he's not going to stand trial at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. That in no way should dissuade prosecutors from going ahead with their work. You never know what could happen."" An indictment of Putin would make the President of Russia an international fugitive. ""It's not easy for a head of state to fear being arrested when he or she puts foot in a European country or in a North American country,"" Goldstone said. Van Schaack said, ""He is inevitably now trapped in Russia. He will never be able to travel internationally, because it would be too great a risk that he would be captured and brought before a court of law."" The same holds true for any other Russian charged with war crimes. ""They will enjoy some impunity while they stay within Russia,"" Van Schaack said, ""but what we have seen is perpetrators don't stay within their home states. They want to go shopping in Europe or go on vacation somewhere, and they get identified, and then the law enforcement is activated. And we are never more integrated than we are now."" Martin asked, ""If no Russian ends up standing trial, will this effort have failed?"" ""I don't think so,"" Van Schaack replied. ""I think it's incredibly important to document the truth of what is happening, if only for the purposes of keeping an accurate history of this horrific moment in time, but also for the benefit of the victims and the survivors.""

Russian military decided to shift focus to the east after failing to take the capital of Kyiv amid fierce Ukrainian resistance. But Russia's record of committing ""atrocities"" and launching ""horrible attacks"" since its invasion of Crimea eight years ago suggests a brutal assault is to come, Markarova said. ""Yes, the enemy — the Russians — they are demotivated,"" she said. ""They are war criminals, but there are so many of them and they still have so much equipment. And it looks like they're going to use all of it. So we are preparing for everything."" Ukraine is trying to evacuate as many civilians as possible from the eastern region while coordinating further assistance from the U.S. and other Western nations. ""I think there is an understanding that after the battle of Kyiv, we really have to win this battle of Donbas, and we have to win this war,"" Markarova said. ""And we need all of the equipment — all of the firepower, all of the anti-air [equipment] — in order to be able to do so."" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier Sunday that the U.S. is considering the transfer of additional weapons to Ukraine as well as training its forces to use certain equipment. Sullivan and Markarova declined to provide details, with the ambassador saying she would rather ""surprise Russians on the battlefields."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine, now in its seventh week, has become increasingly bloody, with CBS News finding evidence of atrocities on the outskirts of Kyiv following the withdrawal of Russian troops from that area. While visiting the town of Bucha early this month, CBS News correspondent Debora Patta and her team saw mass graves filled with nearly 300 bodies, civilians shot in the head with their hands bound, and other grisly scenes. The U.S. Department of Justice said it's working with the Ukrainian government to investigate Russia's alleged war crimes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has accused Moscow of committing genocide, has urged the international community to prosecute all those behind the attacks. In a ""60 Minutes"" interview airing Sunday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine has Russians in custody who have shared evidence of war crimes in Ukraine. Russia has falsely claimed the massacre in Bucha was staged, and it denied responsibility for a missile attack that killed dozens of civilians at a train station last week. Markarova said she hopes a potential international tribune would bring rank-and-file soldiers as well as Russia's military leaders and President Vladimir Putin to justice. ""I know that lawyers have to say 'alleged.' I can say 'war crimes' because we see them. We see them in real time,"" she said, adding that Ukrainian prosecutors have opened more than 4,000 individual criminal cases since the war began. ""So, yes, all of them will be prosecuted — military commanders, personnel, people who did it on the ground, and people who ordered it, and all the way to Putin,"" Markarova said. ""There should be no place on Earth where they could hide. Yes, we would like them to be tried in Ukraine, and we really hope that after we win and after Ukraine is liberated, that we will have a tribunal,"" she continued. ""I think Ukraine and our people are entitled to a full-scale tribunal. But anywhere where they can be prosecuted is fine.""",45,2.0010030185816507,1.0307369283395413,0.9702660902421094,19
2022-04-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-east-donbas-jake-sullivan-face-the-nation/,"U.S. bolstering Ukrainian defenses against Russian advance in east, Sullivan says","As Russian forces shift their attention to the contested Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, the U.S. is focused on helping Ukrainians defend against that advance, just as they did in the capital of Kyiv, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday. ""Our job, Margaret, as I said before, is to help ensure that the Ukrainians are in a position to resist that advance and ultimately to be in the strongest possible position, both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,"" he said, adding that the U.S. and its allies would continue to deliver weapons and other military assistance to Ukraine. Despite the growing death toll and widespread devastation in Ukraine, Sullivan expressed confidence that the country could win more battles with the help of Western nations. ""First, let's pause there for a moment, because it is a remarkable thing that the Ukrainians won the battle of Kyiv,"" he said. ""Russia lost the battle of Kyiv. Kyiv still stands. The capital city of Ukraine was subject to an attack as its invading neighbor tried to conquer Kiev, and Russia failed. ""And they failed chiefly because of the bravery and skill of the Ukrainian armed forces. But they also failed because the United States and our partners put in the hands of those armed forces advanced weapons that help beat back the Russians,"" Sullivan said. Asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin's reported appointment of a general who oversaw a series of brutal attacks in Syria as the new central war commander for Ukraine, Sullivan said the move is an ""indication"" that Ukraine could see more atrocities in the days to come. ""It's actually just consistent with the way Russia has conducted this war from the beginning,"" Sullivan said. ""We've seen scorched-earth warfare already, we've seen atrocities and war crimes, and mass killings and horrifying and shocking images from towns like Bucha and the rocket attack at Kramatorsk."" His assessment comes days after a missile strike on a packed train station in the eastern Ukrainian town of Kramatorsk killed dozens of civilians, including several children, as well as the recent discovery of dozens of bodies in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha and elsewhere following the withdrawal of Russian troops. Sullivan said it's the responsibility of the U.S. and the international community to ""flow weapons and military assistance to Ukraine"" so its forces have the tools to fight back effectively. Russia has denied being responsible for the Kramatorsk strike and has falsely claimed the grisly scenes on the streets of Bucha were staged. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged a tough global response to Russia's brutal invasion of his country, saying Friday night that the train station attack amounted to another war crime for an international tribune to consider. He has also accused Russia of committing genocide in Ukraine with the goal of ""elimination of the whole nation and the people, setting up camps and abducting numerous children. Zelenskyy told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" in an interview set to air Sunday that the Ukrainian security service has intercepted communications from Russian soldiers discussing what he described as war crimes. ""There are [Russian] soldiers talking with their parents about what they stole and who they abducted,"" he said. ""There are recordings of [Russian] prisoners of war who admitted to killing people. There are pilots in prison who had maps with civilian targets to bomb."" Amid calls for the U.S. to do more, Sullivan defended the Biden administration's approach and cited the ""unprecedented scope, scale and speed"" of the assistance provided to Ukraine so far. He said he also expects the existing sanctions against Russia to play a role. ""They will have an effect,"" he said. ""They will lead to a circumstance in which Russia has less capacity, less resources to be able to prosecute this war. So the United States is stepping up and is discharging its obligations on behalf of the Ukrainian people, on behalf of the principles of freedom and liberty and democracy and human rights. And we will continue to do so.""",45,1.772992511194821,2.1269996411292387,-0.35400712993441763,23
2022-04-09,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-kramatorsk-train-station-attack-volodymyr-zelenskyy-response/,Ukraine's leader calls for tough global response against Russia after deadly strike on Kramatorsk train station,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he wants a tough global response after a missile struck a train station packed with civilians trying to escape an imminent Russian offensive, killing at least 52 people. Zelenskyy's voice rose in anger during his nightly address late Friday, when he said the strike on the Kramatorsk train station in eastern Ukraine amounted to another war crime for an international tribunal to consider. Five children were among the dead, and dozens of people were severely injured, Ukrainian officials said. ""All world efforts will be directed to establish every minute of who did what, who gave what orders, where the missile came from, who transported it, who gave the command and how this strike was agreed,"" the president said. Russia denied it was responsible for the strike and accused Ukraine's military of firing the missile as a false-flag operation so Moscow would be blamed for civilian slayings. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman detailed the missile's trajectory and Ukrainian troop positions to bolster the argument. Ukraine's state railway company said in a statement that residents of the country's contested Donbas region, where Russia has refocused its forces after failing to take over the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, could flee through other train stations on Saturday. ""The railways do not stop the task of taking everyone to safety,"" the statement on the messaging app Telegram said. Photos taken after Friday's missile strike showed corpses covered with tarpaulins, and the remnants of a rocket painted with the words ""For the children"" in Russian. The specific Russian phrase has a meaning closer to ""on behalf of children"" or ""in retaliation for an attack on children,"" rather than ""aimed at children."" The attack came as workers elsewhere in the country unearthed at least 67 bodies from a mass grave near a church in Bucha, a town near Kyiv, where graphic evidence of dozens of killings emerged following the withdrawal of Russian forces. Russia has falsely claimed that the scenes in Bucha were staged. Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk has said investigators found at least three sites of mass shootings of civilians and were still finding bodies in yards, parks and city squares — 90% of which were victims who had been shot. Some of the grisliest evidence so far has been found in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv, from which Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops pulled back in recent days. An international organization formed to identify the dead and missing from the 1990s Balkans conflicts is sending a team of forensics experts to Ukraine to help put names to bodies that might otherwise remain anonymous amid the fog of war. In an excerpted interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that aired Friday, Zelenskyy cited communications intercepted by the Ukrainian security service as evidence of Russian war crimes. ""There are (Russian) soldiers talking with their parents about what they stole and who they abducted. There are recordings of (Russian) prisoners of war who admitted to killing people,"" he said. ""There are pilots in prison who had maps with civilian targets to bomb. There are also investigations being conducted based on the remains of the dead."" Zelenskyy's comments echoed reporting from German news magazine Der Spiegel saying Germany's foreign intelligence agency had intercepted Russian military radio traffic in which soldiers may have discussed civilian killings in Bucha. The weekly also reported that the recordings indicated the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was involved in atrocities there. German government officials would not confirm or deny the report, but two former German ministers filed a war crimes complaint Thursday. Russia has denied that its military was involved in war crimes. After failing to occupy Kyiv in the face of stiff resistance, Russian forces have set their sights on the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking, industrial region where Moscow-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years and control some of the area. Although the Kramatorsk train station is in Ukrainian government-controlled territory in the Donbas, the separatists, who work closely with Russian troops, blamed Ukraine for the attack. Western experts, however, dismissed Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov's assertion that Russian forces ""do not use"" Tochka-U missiles, the type that hit the station. A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence, told the Associated Press that Russian forces have used the missile — and that given the strike's location and impact, it was likely Russia's. Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, pointed to other occasions when Russian authorities have tried to deflect blame by claiming their forces no longer use an older weapon ""to kind of muddy the waters and try and create doubt."" He suggested Russia specifically chose the Tochka-U because Ukraine also possesses them. Ukrainian authorities and Western officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of committing atrocities in the war that began with Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. A total of 176 children have been killed in Ukraine since the start of the war, while 324 more have been wounded, the country's Prosecutor General's Office said Saturday. Ukrainian authorities have warned they expect to find evidence of more mass killings once they reach the southern port city of Mariupol, which is also in the Donbas and has been subjected to a monthlong Russian blockade. A senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal military assessments said Friday that the Pentagon believes Russia has lost between 15% and 20% of its combat power overall since the war began. While some combat units are withdrawing to be resupplied in Russia, Moscow has added thousands of troops around Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, in the country's east, the official said. Ukrainian officials have almost daily pleaded with Western powers to send more arms, and to further punish Russia with sanctions, including the exclusion of Russian banks from the global financial system and a total European Union embargo on Russian gas and oil. In Kharkiv, Lidiya Mezhiritska stood in the wreckage of her home after overnight missile strikes turned it to rubble. ""The 'Russian world,' they say,"" she said, wryly invoking Putin's nationalist justification for invading Ukraine. ""People, children, old people, women are dying. I don't have a machine gun. I would definitely go (fight), regardless of age.""",45,2.1529636269401617,3.869759568911234,-1.716795941971072,19

""This is a very well-documented crisis. This has not been done under cover. It's been done in full view of Bellingcat or New York Times satellites that are reporting on the facts,"" says International Rescue Committee CEO David Miliband. ""It's the first cell phone war."" Miliband, a former Labour Party politician and former British foreign secretary, joined CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on ""The Takeout"" this week to discuss the war in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis spawned by Russia's invasion. Miliband identified three categories of people suffering in the weekslong conflict so far: those still trapped in cities and unable to receive aid, like the citizens of Mariupol, those internally displaced inside Ukraine, and those who have fled to neighboring countries outside of Ukraine. He also criticized the U.S. and allies for their slowness to act. They ""should have taken literally and seriously the buildup that happened before February 24,"" when Russia launched its invasion. While Russia appears to have consolidated its forces and withdrawn from the area around Kyiv, the nation's capital, ""there remains real danger,"" he told Garrett. The targeting of civilian structures in Ukraine over the last several weeks has raised accusations of war crimes against Russia. ""If you're a soldier in a conflict, you don't have a right to life.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said in testimony in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that the next phase of the war will be a ""long slog."" Milley said Ukrainians have managed to defeat the Russian onslaught on Kyiv, ""but there's a significant battle yet ahead down in the southeast region, where the Russians intend to mass forces and continue their assault. So I think it's an open question right now how this ends."" Both Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the U.S. is focused on getting the weapons the Ukrainians need and use effectively to them as quickly as possible. Austin told the committee that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""given up"" on the advance toward Kyiv in large part because of the Ukrainian resistance. ""We have provided them those anti-armor, anti-aircraft weapons and also the UAVs that have been really somewhat decisive for lack of a better term,"" Austin said. ""Putin thought he could rapidly take over the country of Ukraine, very rapidly take over the city of Kyiv. He was wrong."" Milley said the U.S. and its allies have provided 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons systems and 60,000 anti-tank systems to Ukraine. He said the weapons helped Ukrainians defend Kyiv. Several senators raised the concern that the assistance is not getting to Ukraine quickly enough since they are fighting for their lives. Austin assured them that the weapons start getting into Ukraine on average between four to five days after an announcement, which he said is unprecedented speed. This week, Russian forces completely withdrew from around Kyiv and Chernihiv and moved north into Belarus and Russia to be refitted, resupplied, and potentially reinforced with additional manpower before entering Ukraine again, likely in the Donbas region. There are no indications as of now that the Russian forces are back in Ukraine, but when they do, officials expect a protracted conflict. Milley told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the conflict will likely be ""measured in years."" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday that just because the Pentagon expects this conflict to last potentially years doesn't mean the Ukrainians can't ultimately win the war. ""The proof is literally in the outcomes you're seeing every day, the Ukrainians are fighting bravely for their country and they have denied Mr. Putin so many of his strategic objectives, so absolutely they can win,"" Kirby said.",7,4.10516235032776,2.9337795337005677,1.171382816627192,27
2022-04-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-military-officials-facebook-hackers-russia-belarus/,Russian-backed hackers broke into Facebook accounts of Ukrainian military officials,"A group of hackers with ties to the Belarusian government broke into the Facebook accounts of Ukrainian military officials and posted videos calling on the Ukrainian army to surrender. According to Facebook's parent company, Meta, the posts appeared as if they were coming from the legitimate account owners. The group of hackers, known in the security industry as Ghostwriter, typically targets victims by compromising their email addresses and using them to gain access to social media accounts. ""When it comes to persistent threat actors, we've seen a further spike in activity by Ghostwriter,"" Ben Nimmo, Meta's global threat intelligence lead for influence operations, said on a call with reporters. He added that since February, ""they've attempted to hack into the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukrainian military personnel."" Meta's head of security policy, Nathaniel Gliecher, said the videos posted on the accounts of Ukrainian military officials were not seen by users and were taken down by the platform before it could be shared with others. Meta also removed a network of 200 accounts operating from Russia that were falsely filing hundreds — and in some cases thousands — of reports against users, mainly in Ukraine and Russia, for various policy violations. The mass reporting was an attempt to silence critics and Ukrainians, Meta said. The operation spiked in mid-February, just before Russia invaded Ukraine. The actors used a variety of fake, authentic and duplicate accounts to falsely report users for violations of hate speech and bullying. Meta said in an attempt to evade detection, the threat actors coordinated their mass reporting activity in a cooking-themed Facebook group that had about 50 members when discovered. ""Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've seen attacks on internet freedom and access to intensify information sharply,"" said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs at Meta. He said those attacks are manifested through Russian state propaganda, media influence operations, espionage campaigns and attempts to close the flow of credible information. Meta said threat actors with links to Russia and Belarus who are engaging in cyber espionage and covert influence operations have an interest in the Ukrainian telecom industry, defense and energy sectors, tech platforms and journalists. But Ukrainian officials believe Russia is behind the disinformation efforts, timed to coincide with conventional warfare. ""Cyberwar is a component of conventional war, provided by Russia against Ukraine,"" said top Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora during a briefing with reporters on Tuesday. One group with ties to the Belarusian KGB, which Meta previously took down in November, returned with a new operation a day before Russia's invasion began. Meta said the group ""suddenly"" began posting in Polish and English about Ukrainian troops surrendering and leaders surrendering without a fight. On March 14, the group created an event in Warsaw calling for a protest against the Polish government, Meta alleged. The event was on the platform for ""a few hours at most"" and taken down along with the account behind it, Nimmo said. New information about threat actors with ties to Russia who are targeting Ukrainian officials and public figures on Facebook is part of the company's new quarterly Adversarial Threat report. It builds on the existing quarterly community standards report and the monthly coordinated inauthentic behavior report. The disinformation campaign by Russian-aligned actors targeting Ukrainians on social media and online comes at the same time as other cyberattacks targeting Ukrainian government agencies, media groups and telecommunications. The Security Service of Ukraine announced Thursday it uncovered another text message campaign pushing 5,000 SMS messages to Ukrainian military and law enforcement officers demanding that they defect and surrender to Russian forces. ""The outcome of events is predetermined!"" the messages said, according to Ukrainian officials. ""Be prudent and refuse to support nationalism and leaders of the country who discredited themselves and already fled the capital!!!"" Between March 23 and March 29, Ukrainian critical infrastructure registered 65 cyberattacks – five times more than the previous week – according to a report by Ukraine's State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection (SSSCIP). The agency said top targets included state and local authorities, the security and defense sector, financial companies, satellite telecommunications and the energy sector. ""We do not see serious and complicated attacks on critical infrastructure which can be successful so far,"" said Zhora, deputy chief of Ukraine's SSSCIP. ""We register attempts, but I hope we will be able to effectively counteract them and provide security to our IT systems."" But hackers did launch a ""sophisticated and massive"" attack against the infrastructure of one of Ukraine's largest providers, Ukrtelecom, on March 28, Kirill Goncharuk, the company's chief information officer, told reporters on Tuesday. The attack against Ukrtelecom was launched from inside Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory, though Goncharuk did not disclose the specific location, citing security reasons. Goncharuk said hackers used an employee's compromised account to gain entry. The employee is currently safe, but the CIO declined to say whether the individual was physically coerced into handing over access. Traffic in the network fell to 13% of the regular regime of the network's functioning but, according to the SSSCIP, Ukrtelecom security experts detected the attack within 15 minutes after its launch and restored 85% of service within 24 hours. During the attack, intruders attempted to disable the company's servers and take control of Ukrtelecom's network by attempting to change the passwords of employees' accounts as well as the passwords to equipment and firewalls, according to Goncharuk. Investigators say it appears that the attackers did not access customer data. Officials have not yet attributed the attack. The investigation – in coordination with Microsoft and Cisco – is ongoing. ""The majority of [cyber]attacks that come to Ukrainian infrastructure at the moment have Russian origins,"" Zhora told reporters. ""And it doesn't matter whether the FSB or GRU originate it. Different APT groups can sit on the same floor in the same buildings."" The hack follows an attack on U.S. telecommunications firm Viasat on February 24 that targeted terminals in Ukraine but also caused outages in Germany and other European countries at the start of the Russian invasion. A U.S. official tells CBS News that American intelligence officials believe Russian state-actors were behind the Viasat hack, though the White House has not publicly said so. U.S. officials believe it was meant to disrupt service in Ukraine but spread beyond the intended targets. The Biden administration remains concerned that cyberattacks targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure could ""spill over"" to the U.S. and its allies, similar to events surrounding the 2017 NotPetya malware attack. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell on Wednesday that Russian actors ""have not attacked our critical infrastructure in retaliation to the sanctions we've imposed."" ""We are preparing for an attack,"" Mayorkas added, noting that U.S. officials are on high alert for potential breaches of critical infrastructure, including U.S. banks, the energy grid and water system. ""We are poised to defend ourselves."" Testifying in the Senate this week, U.S. Cyber Command chief Gen. Paul Nakasone cautiously supported the creation of a ""social media data threat analysis center"" to help combat foreign influence campaigns. ""Based on my experience, watching two different election cycles and the work of our adversaries attempt to garner greater influence, I think such a center would be helpful,"" he told lawmakers, adding that researchers must evaluate ""the full spectrum"" of adversaries' capabilities, including tactics, tradecraft and procedures.""",20,5.607428262332369,4.439940351990499,1.1674879103418698,16

There are fears Russian troops could carry out massacres there like they're alleged to have done in the suburbs of Kyiv. Ukraine's president and other officials have issued increasingly urgent calls for the U.S. and its NATO partners to provide more — and more advanced — weapons to help the country stop Russia's brutal invasion. Even before President Vladmir Putin ordered that invasion on February 24, Ukraine had been fighting Russian-backed separatists in Donbas for eight years, since his last invasion in 2014. Senior Lieutenant ""Starsky"" — a military callsign, not his real name — was among the troops engaged in the simmering conflict in the east. He told CBS News correspondent Debora Patta that his passion was forged during the defiant days of the 2014 ""Maidan"" uprising, against Russian influence in Ukraine. Starsky was injured during the protests, which inspired him to join his country's national guard. He spent the following years on the frontlines in Donbas, fighting Russia's proxy forces. ""We spent eight years of learning to fight specifically against Russians, so they made a big mistake,"" he said of what came next. Starsky put his skills to good use when, on the first day of Putin's new invasion, 35 Russian helicopters started attacking Hostomel airport on the northwest outskirts of Ukraine's capital of Kyiv. He told CBS News that as he and his men opened fire on the incoming attack helicopters with their rifles, ""at first I thought: 'Stupid idea,' because they're armored!"" But Starsky and his unit of Ukrainian defenders mounted a fierce resistance. After a vicious three-day battle that laid waste to the facility's runway, hangar and planes stored there, they scored an improbable victory: The Ukrainians wrested back full control of the airport. ""Later, we realized what we had done had changed the course of the war,"" he told Patta. By holding onto Hostomel airport, even if it meant destroying it, Starsky and his fellow soldiers denied Russia the ability to establish an air bridge from Russia into the Kyiv region. Had they failed, Putin's military would have been able to fly in supplies, equipment and, crucially, more manpower. They may well have gone on to seize Kyiv itself. ""If they managed to land their cargo airplanes at Hostomel, we would have a full Russian brigade stationed just 10 kilometers [about 6 miles] away from Kyiv, and that would be a huge problem,"" Starsky told Patta. ""I think that invasion would look absolutely different."" The defeat at Hostomel slowed the Russians down, but it did not stop them from seizing control of nearby Bucha and other towns, where they stand accused of executing hundreds of civilians. Bucha residents have told CBS News and other news outlets that the Russian occupiers murdered people in cold blood during their time in control of the town, some of them with their hands bound, shot point-blank and then left on the street or thrown into shallow mass graves. But Starsky is worried the war could get even dirtier. He told Patta Ukraine's forces know Russian officers operating in Donbas have received antidotes to protect them against the effects of their own chemical weapons. ""We have information that chemical weapons will be used on the frontlines,"" he told CBS News. U.S. officials have for weeks warned that Russian claims — dismissed as nonsense by Washington — about supposed American work in Ukraine on biological and chemical weapons could be a preamble to Putin's forces using banned substances themselves. President Biden called the Russian claims a ""clear sign"" that Putin was considering use of chemical weapons. The Pentagon and its partners have also warned that Putin's troops, after taking serious casualties and being forced to pull back from the Kyiv area, are regrouping, and preparing to stage a major offensive in Donbas. Russia has made it clear that it will shift the focus of what Putin calls his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine to the eastern part of the country. But Starsky is standing firm. He said that while the biggest plane in the world — nicknamed ""The Dream"" — was destroyed in the battle to defend Hostomel, the Russians will not manage to kill Ukraine's dream to hold onto its freedom.",7,4.086848030001169,2.6227821467845245,1.4640658832166449,21
2022-04-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/fbi-pittsburgh-helps-break-up-russia-cybercrimes/,FBI Pittsburgh Office Leads Actions To Disrupt Russian Cybercrime Operation,"WASHINGTON (AP/KDKA) — The war in Ukraine has come home in the form of cyberattacks on the U.S. economy. The FBI field office in Pittsburgh is being credited with saving thousands of small business computer systems, identifying and blocking a network of Russian bots before the damage could be done. ""We removed malware from devices used by thousands of mostly small businesses for network security all over the world and then we shut the door the Russians had used to get into them,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. The announcement in Washington D.C. is part of a Justice Department crackdown on illegal Russian activity involving the seizure of assets from rich associates of Vladimir Putin known oligarchs. But this cyber attack was initiated by the Russian government itself, the military intelligence unit known as GRU. Two years ago, after an investigation by Pittsburgh FBI, prosecutors indicted six GRU hackers as part of an attack resulting in billions of dollars of losses in the U.S., and U.S. Attorney Cindy Chung says all businesses are at risk. ""It can be used to deploy spyware onto possible victims' computers, it could be used to shutdown victims' access, it could be used to just monitor traffic,"" she said. Special Agent-in-Charge Mike Nordwall is asking all businesses to contact the FBI if they observe irregular or suspicious cyber activity. Nordwall: ""It's certainly part of an ongoing persistent threat that's posed by the Russian government, certainly within cyberspace.""Sheehan: ""To disrupt the U.S. economy?""Nordwall: ""To disrupt US interests and certainly economic security."" The actions, announced amid Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, underscore what U.S. officials say are their efforts to crack down on Russian criminal activity, to choke off the flow of ""dirty money"" and to disrupt the Kremlin's malicious cyber acts. The case against Konstantin Malofeyev, a Russian media baron, accuses him of trying to evade earlier Treasury Department sanctions resulting from Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Though the sanctions barred U.S. citizens from working for or doing business with him, Malofeyev allegedly used co-conspirators to secretly acquire media organizations across Europe in hopes of spreading pro-Russia propaganda. A former CNBC and Fox News employee was arrested in London last month for his work as a television producer for Malofeyev. The announcements come two days after U.S. officials seized a yacht in Spain belonging to a Russian oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg, with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Justice Department in the last year has taken aim against Russia-based cybercrime, recovering in June most of a multimillion-dollar ransom that Colonial Pipeline paid to hackers after a ransomware attack that halted operations and announcing charges last fall against two suspected ransomware operators.

2022-04-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-crimes-investigation/,"Ukraine already investigating almost 4,500 alleged Russian war crimes","Berdychiv, Ukraine — Evidence of the cruelty and terror of Russia's war on Ukraine continues to emerge. New video appears to show an ambulance hit by shelling in the parking lot of a hospital in the southern city of Mykolaiv. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that Russia is intentionally killing civilians in his country. Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of carrying out genocide in Ukraine. The Biden administration hasn't gone that far, but Britain's prime minister said on Wednesday that, ""what Putin has done in Ukraine doesn't look far short of genocide to me."" NOTE: Both the video above and the article below contain disturbing material. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports that Ukrainian prosecutors say they're already investigating almost 4,500 alleged war crimes by Russian troops. The country's prosecutor general said they were determined to ""punish the monsters who are responsible"" for the atrocities in Ukraine. The cruelty of the Russian troops who recently pulled out of the Kyiv suburb of Bucha — the inhumanity they inflicted on civilians — is painful to look at. But Ukrainian investigators can't turn away. It's their job to document it: Meticulously noting every charred corpse, every victim with a gunshot wound to the head and hands bound behind their back. It's grim but vital work, because Russia has been accused of war crimes. Ukraine's Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said he had one simple message for Putin: ""Go to hell."" Irina Abramova said her husband Oleg was the love of her life. She described to journalists in Bucha how he was executed by the Russians. ""They took him from our home in his slippers,"" she said. ""They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him… They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him."" In the western city of Lviv — largely spared from Russia's attacks and sheltering many of the 11 million Ukrainians who've been driven from their homes — there was a candlelit vigil Tuesday night for the civilians killed in the war. ""We want just to pray for their soul, and at the same time we want to pray for Ukraine,"" Svitlana Shklova said at the vigil. ""We hope that our nation will win this war."" The atrocities have not been confined to Bucha. Other towns and villages have also reported horrors under Russian occupation. For Ukrainians, the slaughter of their own people is heart-rending — and it's fueling the fight to protect their homeland and their freedom, whatever the cost. Williams and her team were granted rare access to a Ukrainian military hospital where medics are treating soldiers wounded on the frontlines. Mykola, a mechanic and military reservist, told CBS News he was hit by shrapnel during a firefight with the Russians. ""We can't stop them on our own,"" he told Williams. ""We have to rely on support from the West. Something needs to be done, because this will go on and on."" Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said on Tuesday that despite the still-increasing flood of American weaponry and other military aid into Ukraine, he, too, believed it would be ""a very protracted conflict,"" measured in years, not weeks or months. On Tuesday, the Biden administration promised another $100 million worth of ""security assistance,"" aimed at strengthening ""Ukraine's position on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,"" according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Part of that new assistance will be more Javelin anti-tank rockets from Pentagon stocks — weapons that have already helped Ukraine push Russia's forces back around Kyiv and other cities. Blinken also said the U.S. and its allies would continue ""to gather information to document reported abuses and make it available to the appropriate bodies to hold those responsible to account."" Many Ukrainians have expressed to CBS News' teams their gratitude for American help — but some are also frustrated. As their president has made clear on multiple occasions, to every world leader who will listen, they say they need more weapons, especially aircraft and modern air defense systems. With Russian troops believed to be regrouping after their withdrawal from the Kyiv region for a looming renewed assault in Eastern Ukraine, they say that need could not be more urgent.",45,3.0854777852202604,3.385156614791279,-0.29967882957101866,21

""Recent news from the war in Ukraine, instead of bringing relief and hope, brought new atrocities, such as the massacre of Bucha,"" he said toward the end of the audience. ""Cruelty that is increasingly horrendous, also against civilians, defenseless women and children. They are victims whose innocent blood cries out up to heaven and implores: 'Stop this war! Let the weapons fall silent! Stop sowing death and destruction',"" said Francis. The pope then held up the stained Ukrainian flag and invited a group of Ukrainian refugee children accompanied by two women to join him at the podium. He folded the flag and kissed it. ""These children had to flee and come to a strange land. This is one of the fruits of war,"" he said. ""Let's not forget them, and let's not forget the Ukrainian people."" It is estimated that about 90% of the more than 4.2 million Ukrainian refugees who have fled their country since Russia invaded on February 24 are women and children. A day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the United Nations of failing to stop Russia's brutal assault on his country, Pope Francis echoed the sentiment. After World War II, countries tried to lay the foundations for a ""new era of peace,"" the pontiff said on Wednesday, ""but unfortunately the old story of competition between the greater powers went on, and in the current war in Ukraine, we are witnessing the impotence of international organizations."" Francis has pleaded incessantly for the cessation of hostilities since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine. The pope has confirmed that he's considering a trip to Kyiv, and that Vatican diplomats are working behind the scenes in a bid to stop the war.",45,5.150263708763064,5.4632660742403285,-0.31300236547726445,23
2022-04-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukrainians-in-america-training-weapons-pentagon/,Pentagon training a small number of Ukrainians in the U.S. on new weapons,"A small number of Ukrainians who have been in the U.S. since the fall in professional military education programs have received rudimentary training on weapons systems that are new to the Ukrainian military, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said in a press briefing Wednesday. The U.S. has taken advantage of having a small number of Ukrainians in the country and pulled them aside for a couple of days to receive training on how to operate switchblade drones. Kirby said training on the drones only takes a couple of days. The small number of individuals are expected to go back to Ukraine relatively soon, as was initially planned and can train additional Ukrainian soldiers on the weapons. The $800 million in assistance President Biden approved in March included 100 switchblade drones. Kirby on Wednesday said that all 100 of those drones have shipped to the region and are on their way to Ukraine, if they're not in Ukraine already. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the new equipment heading over to Ukraine does require some additional training and some of that training is occurring in the U.S. There are two versions of the switchblade, one goes after personnel and another after armored vehicles, like tanks. Austin told the House committee on Tuesday that Ukraine will receive both versions. Overall, the U.S. has committed $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion started. The U.S. has two coordination cells that are assisting in making sure the weapons the Ukrainians need from the U.S. and other allies get into the hands of the Ukrainian military. Since Mr. Biden has said no U.S. troops will be sent into Ukraine, the U.S. is coordinating the shipments to go into Ukraine mostly by land. Kirby said Wednesday that on average, it takes between four to six days after an announcement of assistance for the first shipment to arrive in Ukraine, which is unprecedented speed, according to Kirby. The Biden administration has announced an additional $100 million worth of Javelins will head to Ukraine. This announcement came as the Ukrainian military is expecting increased fighting in the east now that the Russian military has stated it is reprioritizing the Donbas region.",49,5.25436045790963,5.147228200867924,0.10713225704170615,27

Emerging evidence of what appeared to be widespread civilian massacres in the wake of Russian withdrawals from the Kyiv areas may complicate Beijing's attempts to guide public opinion over the conflict, in which China has refused to criticize Moscow. China supports all initiatives and measures ""conducive to alleviating the humanitarian crisis"" in the country, and is ""ready to continue to work together with the international community to prevent any harm to civilians,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing. ""The truth and the cause of the incident must be verified,"" Zhao said. ""All parties should exercise restraint and avoid unfounded accusations before a conclusion of the investigation is drawn."" Zhao's remarks echo those of China's ambassador to the United Nations, Zhang Jun, who earlier called for an investigation, also describing the reports and images of civilian deaths in Bucha as ""deeply disturbing."" ""The relevant circumstances and specific causes of the incident should be verified and established,"" Zhang said in remarks to the Security Council on Tuesday, adding that, ""before the full picture is clear, all sides should exercise restraint and avoid unfounded accusations."" China has called for talks while refusing to criticize Russia. It opposes economic sanctions on Moscow and blames Washington and NATO for provoking the war and fueling the conflict by sending arms to Ukraine. The entirely ruling Communist Party-controlled media have largely stuck to a pro-Moscow narrative, including repeating Russian disinformation and unfounded conspiracy theories about issues such as alleged American-Ukrainian bioweapons production. Zhao repeated China's objections to sanctions, while accusing the U.S. of having manipulated the situation to ""profit from the chaos and make a lot of money."" ""History and reality have proven that sanctions do not bring peace and security, but only bring lose-lose or multiple losses, adding to the already difficult world economy and impacting the existing world economic system,"" Zhao said. The hashtag ""China expresses Bucha death incident must be thoroughly investigated"" was a trending topic on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, with nearly 30 million views and more than 500 discussions by afternoon Wednesday Despite the pro-Russian stance of authorities who regularly censor postings, opinions were divided between support for Moscow, demands Russia be held accountable, accusations of untrustworthiness against the West and Ukraine, and calls for an impartial investigation. ""This is merely a play acted out by the Americans and Ukrainian Nazis in an attempt to divert public opinion, but people of the world with eyes and hearts won't ignore the facts of the U.S. and Ukraine researching bio weapons,"" read one posting signed ""Understands the Cold War Better Than America."" The Russian Embassy in Beijing also made use of the platform to reject the accusations, while its Ukrainian counterpart drew attention to ""Russian war crimes against civilians in Irpin,"" another town where atrocities allegedly occurred. Prior to the February 24 launch of the war, China had dismissed talk of a Russian invasion as ""fake news"" and U.S. fearmongering. Since then, it has claimed to be holding to an independent, and often contradictory, stance, asserting the sanctity of borders and national sovereignty while refusing to condemn Russian aggression or even use the words ""war"" and ""invasion,"" in apparent deference to Moscow. The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily, sought to balance the competing messages with an editorial Wednesday headlined ""'Bucha Incident' not to be used as pretext for inflaming situation."" ""As long as Russia and Ukraine cannot achieve a cease-fire, humanitarian tragedies will not end,"" the paper said. ""However, it is regrettable that after the exposure of the 'Bucha incident,' the U.S., the initiator of the Ukraine crisis, has not shown any signs of urging peace and promoting talks, but is ready to exacerbate the Russia-Ukraine tensions and create obstacles to the peace talks between the two sides,"" it said.",45,4.499323767093506,4.142259442062185,0.35706432503132035,3

2022-04-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-hypersonic-missiles-uk-australia/,U.S. developing hypersonic missiles with U.K. and Australia,"Washington — The United States, United Kingdom and Australia announced Tuesday they will work together via the recently created security alliance known as AUKUS to develop hypersonic missiles. The move comes amid growing concern by the U.S. and allies about China's growing military assertiveness in the Pacific. U.S. President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the plan after holding a check-in on the progress of AUKUS, the Indo-Pacific alliance that was launched by the three countries in September. The leaders said in a joint statement they are ""committed today to commence new trilateral cooperation on hypersonics and counter-hypersonics, and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as to expand information sharing and to deepen cooperation on defense innovation."" The U.S., Russia and China have all looked to further develop hypersonic missiles - a system so fast that it cannot be intercepted by any current missile defense system. In October, Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed that China had conducted a test of a hypersonic weapon system as part of its aggressive effort to advance in space and military technologies. Milley described the Chinese test as a ""very significant event of a test of a hypersonic weapon system, and it is very concerning,"" in a Bloomberg Television interview. Russia has used hypersonic missiles ""multiple"" times in Ukraine, according to the top U.S. commander in Europe. Last fall, as U.S. intelligence officials had become increasingly concerned about the massing of Russian forces on the Ukraine border, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged the country's arms manufacturers to develop even more advanced hypersonic missiles to maintain the country's edge in military technologies. The Russian military has said that its Avangard system is capable of flying 27 times faster than the speed of sound and making sharp maneuvers on its way to a target to dodge the enemy's missile shield. It has been fitted to the existing Soviet-built intercontinental ballistic missiles instead of older type warheads, and the first unit armed with the Avangard entered duty in December 2019. The Kinzhal, carried by MiG-31 fighter jets, has a range of up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,250 miles) and flies at 10 times the speed of sound, according to Russian officials. The Pentagon's 2023 budget request already includes $4.7 billion for research and development of hypersonic weapons. It includes planning that would have a hypersonic missile battery fielded by next year, a sea-based missile by 2025 and an air-based cruise missile by 2027. Biden, Johnson and Morrison have billed the creation of AUKUS as a chance to build greater sharing of defense capabilities. As their first major action, the alliance said it would help equip Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. Morrison said the development of hypersonic missiles fit with Australia's strategic plan released two years ago to enhance its military's long-range strike capabilities. ""The paramount goal is to ensure we get that capability as soon as we can and it's in the best form that can be working with our partners,"" Morrison told reporters. Australia's Defense Minister Peter Dutton had earlier announced plans to spend $2.6 billion to acquire long-range strike missiles for fighter jets and warships years ahead of schedule because of growing threats posed by Russia and China. A draft security pact between the Solomon Islands and China has prompted concerns about a possible Chinese naval presence 1,200 miles off the northeast Australian coast. The Solomon Islands government said it won't allow China to build a military base there and China has denied seeking a military foothold in the islands.",49,4.923969206905241,6.417728822623054,-1.4937596157178135,22
2022-04-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bucha-massacre-ukraine-russia-atrocities-evidence/,Bucha massacre: CBS News finds evidence of atrocities near Ukraine's capital as Russia is accused of war crimes,"Kyiv — Global shock and anger over the brutality of Russia's war on Ukraine was still building Tuesday when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the United Nations Security Council on the atrocities discovered on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukraine says mass graves and bodies in the streets in the town of Bucha tell a story of indiscriminate murder, and many world leaders — including President Joe Biden — are calling it a war crime. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta and her team visited Bucha to see for themselves the evidence of killings that Russia has dismissed as ""fake."" NOTE: Some of the images in the video above and in the article below are disturbing. Moscow claimed on Monday that the deaths occurred after its forces left the area, and that Russian soldiers never harmed a single civilian, but an analysis of satellite photos, first reported by the New York Times, shows bodies were strewn across Bucha's streets and yards long before Russian forces beat a hasty retreat late last week. Patta said that when she and her team visited the town, they saw evidence of atrocities: Civilians shot in the head with their hands bound; at least one resident apparently cut down by Russian tank fire while riding down the street on a bicycle; mass graves filled with nearly 300 bodies. There is a trail of destruction and death carved through Bucha, and Patta said it is exactly what war crimes look like. Having reported from many conflict zones and bearing witness to some of the most brutal atrocities of this century, Patta said what she found in Bucha was among the worst she had ever seen. ""I personally saw evidence of war crimes,"" Patta reported on Tuesday. ""These stories cannot be staged, and the overwhelming grief I have witnessed cannot be manufactured."" Patta and her team saw a couple react as they spotted one victim in particular in a mass grave. They thought they'd recognized their son's arm, but it was not him. Their grim search continued. In one building, the CBS News team found the body of a man who appeared to have been blindfolded, with his hands tied behind his back. The rudimentary safety helmet he had on was no defense against a bullet to the head. Yuri, a resident, told Patta he'd seen Russian soldiers bring the man at gunpoint into the building where he was killed. Russian troops had set up camp in a courtyard outside Yuri's apartment block. Their presence is still felt in the discarded beer bottles, empty munition boxes and overturned cars they left behind. On the first day of the invasion, Russian paratroopers spilled onto the tarmac at the nearby airport in Hostomel. Not much is left of that airport, where one of the most significant battles of the war was fought. Ukraine's defenders stopped the Russians there as they tried to take over the country. The airport has been reduced to an apocalyptic scene, with the crumpled, melted frame of the world's largest airplane serving as testament to the fierce fight that stopped Russian forces from establishing a supply line there, but could not stop their invasion of nearby Bucha, and the horror that followed. Tanya Nedashkivs'ka found her husband dead among a pile of bodies at the foot of a basement staircase. ""I'm begging you, do something,"" she said through sobs.

2022-04-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-crimes-what-are-they-and-could-putin-be-prosecuted/,"What are war crimes, is Russia committing them in Ukraine, and could Putin be prosecuted?","London — As horrific scenes were revealed in the wake of Russian troops pulling out of the town of Bucha in Ukraine, President Joe Biden on Monday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of war crimes. ""He is a war criminal,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I think it is a war crime. ... He should be held accountable."" The United States had already formally accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine, and a number of national and international organizations have opened investigations, collecting evidence to build cases. But could Putin himself ever face a war crimes trial? There are a number of international treaties — the Geneva Convention and the Geneva Protocol being two of the most important — that establish international legal standards for warfare. Any violation of those standards is a war crime that can be prosecuted at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague, and can result in imprisonment for perpetrators. National governments, unilaterally or in partnerships, can also conduct their own war crimes investigations and prosecutions based on their own laws or the principle of universal jurisdiction, which determines some war crimes to be so extraordinary that they shock the conscience of humanity as a whole and therefore can be prosecuted anywhere. Deliberate attacks against civilians are war crimes, as are ""methods of war that are inherently indiscriminate and that simply can't make the distinction between the civilian population and armed forces,"" Jim Goldston, executive director of the Open Society Foundations' Justice Initiative, told CBS News. Goldston said there were many indications that Russia was committing war crimes in Ukraine. ""There is an enormous effort now underway … to kind of hoover up all this information and organize it, that looks at where military forces are located, what are the targets, what are the structures being targeted, and gathering that together with testimonies that are being reported of people who are being victimized in these areas,"" he said. All of the information being gathered could be used as evidence in possible war crimes trials at the ICC or in separate tribunals. ""One of the challenges in these kinds of investigations, though, will be to demonstrate the linkage between what is happening on the ground and those who have military or political responsibility for ordering these attacks,"" Goldston said. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called Russia's actions in Ukraine ""genocide,"" appealing to nations around the world for help. ""The aerial bombing of a children's hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening, Zelenskyy said on March 9. But while recognizing the horror of the atrocities being carried out by Russia in Ukraine, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday that he had not seen evidence they had risen to the level of genocide. Under international law, genocide is defined as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" This can involve killing or causing serious bodily harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting conditions of life designed to destroy the group, forcibly removing children from the group and transferring them to others, or imposing measures intended to prevent births in the group. Whether Russia's actions in Ukraine amount to genocide is still being debated by experts, Professor Alex Hinton, director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University, wrote in The Conversation. Russia has targeted and killed civilians and created ""harsh conditions of life"" in many parts of Ukraine, including the besieged city of Mariupol, where civilians without food or water continue to be denied access to lifesaving aid shipments. It has also reportedly forcibly transported hundreds of Ukrainians, including children, to Russia. In public rhetoric, it has undermined and denied the very existence of Ukrainian identity and outlined a goal eradicating it in some areas. ""There is a significant risk that Russia will commit genocide in Ukraine,"" Hinton wrote. ""It is possible that a genocide has already begun."" ""Traditionally in the international criminal tribunals, it has been very difficult to take [war crimes and crimes against humanity] all the way up to the top,"" Philippe Sands, a law professor and Director of the Center on International Courts and Tribunals at University College London told CBS News' partner network, BBC News. Sands is among a number academics and former world leaders calling for the establishment of a special international tribunal modeled on the Nuremberg Trials, which were held for Nazi leaders after World War II, to hold Russia's leaders to account for the crime of ""aggression"" in Ukraine. ""A crime of aggression is waging an illegal war,"" Sands said. ""It's part of international law, it's part of the law of Ukraine, and it's pretty clearly established in the present case, because there's no justification."" In the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine — barring an extremely unlikely referral from the United Nations Security Council, where Russia holds veto power — the ICC does not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, so a separate tribunal would be necessary for any indictment. But because it is the act of waging an illegal war, it could be easier to attribute it to Putin himself. ""The crime of aggression is virtually, by definition, a leadership crime,"" Goldston said. ""Only leaders have the power to actually invade another state, or a small circle of folks around them who have the political authority to actually make that happen."" If such a case did get off the ground, it's still unclear whether Putin himself could be successfully prosecuted, or what an indictment might mean for him. ""What happens if there were a tribunal that were to indict him? It would face challenges. One, of head of state immunity. The law on the immunity of someone who's head of state is debated, certainly, depending on the jurisdiction that is bringing the charges. And then, just the physical question of how you would get custody over somebody like that is huge,"" Goldston said. ""But there are damaging effects of indictment, short of custody,"" Goldston added. Pointing to the indictments of the former political and military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs, he said: ""The indictments themselves, the public nature of the charges, I think it's fair to say, acted to stigmatize them, to isolate them politically, to make it untenable for them to participate in political negotiations and diplomatic negotiations. So indictments alone can have an effect, even short of arrest.""",45,4.634651479051856,4.794460596273198,-0.15980911722134206,8

The so-called Conti group, notorious for its use of ransomware to extort millions from hospitals and emergency services, now threatened to target America's critical infrastructure — vital systems like the power grid and water supply. For three tense days, cyber-defense professionals anxiously anticipated the group's next move. Then, with little warning, the gang blew up. Conti's network was allegedly infiltrated by a Ukrainian security researcher who leaked the group's secrets on Twitter, including its chat records, ransomware code and financial details. The leak revealed that Conti was disorganized and prone to internal squabbles. They were also one of the most profitable hacking crews in the world. ""Ransomware-as-a-service,"" known as RaaS, has exploded in popularity in recent years, with criminal gangs raking in cash extorted from health care providers, retailers, manufacturers, colleges, local governments and many other organizations. Such schemes shot up up 85% last year from 2020, and individual demands increased 144% to $2.2 million. The average payment was up 78%, to roughly $541,000, according to a new report by Unit 42, a threat research team at Palo Alto Networks. ""The vast majority of ransomware actors are financially motivated. RaaS makes carrying out attacks significantly easier by lowering the barrier to entry and expanding the reach of ransomware,"" Unit 42's Ryan Olson told CBS News. ""As organizations continue to pay ransoms, the more these actors invest in their ransomware organizations and are fueled to continue their efforts."" Many hacking groups operate like a business that is run ""for criminals, by criminals, with agreements that set terms, often in exchange for monthly fees or a percentage of ransoms paid,"" Olson said, adding that the groups often are compartmentalized with departments focused on tasks like administration, coding, marketing and security testing. These three organizations accounted for more than a third of ransomware activity last year: Conti's growth was astronomical and unprecedented, Olson said. In the two years prior to the leaks that led to the group's implosion, their activities surged. Conti was responsible for more security incidents than any other ransomware gang. The group stole and publicly released private information from over 600 companies and government organizations. Their average ransom demand rose from just $178,000 in early 2020 to nearly $1.8 million last year. ""They're ruthless,"" Olson said, noting the group's willingness to go after more vulnerable targets like hospitals, health care providers, municipal governments and law enforcement agencies. ""They operate without a code of honor."" On a dark web forum in February, Conti announced its ""full support"" of the Russian government and threatened to use its ""full capacity to deliver retaliatory measures"" if NATO allies targeted Russian infrastructure with cyberattacks. REvil is best known for demanding $70 million in 2021 from software infrastructure provider Kaseya — the biggest ransomware attack on record. The group pioneered ransomware-as-a-service, a business model that allows cybercriminals to sell their hacking expertise and launch attacks using their own particular ransomware software. REvil's software would infect and lock networked office workstations, often shutting down the targeted business until a ransom demand was paid. REvil's demands varied, depending on the size of the company and type of data stolen. If a company failed to pay, REvil would double their ransom demands and publish the stolen data. Unit 42 analysts found that REvil's average demand in 2021 jumped to $2.2 million, more than four times the $500,000 it had asked for previously. Their highest ransom demand last year was $5.4 million. The group was allegedly dismantled recently by Russia's internal security agency at the request of several international law enforcement agencies, including U.S. authorities. The HelloKitty group might be less famous than rival ransomware gangs, but they are pioneers. In early 2020 a Linux-variant of its ransomware targeted VMWare's software used in data centers. HelloKitty is best known for allegedly having stolen and released source code from Polish video game developer CD Projekt Red. The gang, also known as FiveHands, favored corporate targets and used a multipronged attack, often threatening to release stolen data on the dark web and hammering victims with denial of service attacks if ransom demands weren't met. Law enforcement agencies believe that prior to the Russian invasion, the group operated from eastern Ukraine. While not as financially successful as other major ransomware gangs, HelloKitty's tactics and tech were innovative, inspiring more famous ransomware operators. ""Cybercrime is a cat-and-mouse game,"" Olson said ""There are always ways to stop attackers from being successful. However attackers will continue to evolve and innovate their tactics. It's critical to be prepared and educated on the latest threats so you know how to protect your organization.""",20,6.405597588937621,8.983039268611288,-2.577441679673667,2
2022-04-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-demands-un-act-to-stop-putin-destroying-cities/,"Zelenskyy tells U.N. it must act now to stop Putin as Russia is ""deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities""","United Nations — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that Russian troops invading his country had ""killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" He made it clear that he believed the United Nations had failed to end the brutal attack on his country and needed to change to serve its intended purpose of keeping peace in the world. Zelenskyy addressed the U.N.'s most powerful body — of which Russia is a permanent, veto-wielding member — amid growing outrage around the world over fast-emerging evidence that Russian forces deliberately killed civilians in Ukraine. The Biden administration has backed Zelenskyy's accusation that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine, but it has not yet agreed with his assertion that Putin's forces are guilty of the specific crime of genocide. Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting like a brutal colonizer. He made it clear that without changes to stop Russia using its veto power to block Security Council action, the United Nations and the entire system of global security it represents could be rendered obsolete. The Ukrainian leader called on the U.N. to either kick Russia out, or change the Council's rules. ""Ukraine has the moral right to propose a reform of the world security system,"" he said. ""We have proven that we help others... now we need decisions from the Security Council for peace in Ukraine."" ""The U.N. system must be reformed immediately so that the [Security Council] veto is not the right to die,"" said Zelenskyy. Suggesting more atrocities were yet to be revealed, he accused Russia of ""deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities."" ""Now the world can see what they have done in Bucha,"" he told the Security Council. ""But the world has yet to see what Russia has done in other regions."" ""Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and airstrikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from hostilities. They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians hide from airstrikes,"" Zelenskyy said. CBS News has witnessed firsthand clear evidence of atrocities in towns and villages around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Bodies were found littering the streets of Bucha, with scores more dumped into hastily dug mass graves. The gruesome scenes left behind by Vladimir Putin's invading forces have led to calls for tougher sanctions against the Kremlin, including a complete cut-off of gas and oil imports from Russia. Germany and France reacted by expelling dozens of Russian diplomats, suggesting they were spies. U.S. President Joe Biden said Putin should be tried for war crimes. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened Tuesday's Security Council session, blasting Russia for the ""senseless loss of life, massive devastation in urban centers, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure"" in Ukraine. ""I will never forget the horrifying images of civilians killed in Bucha,"" Guterres said. He spoke indirectly about Russia's vetos and threats of vetos that have prevented Security Council action over the Ukraine war thus far. In several instances, the U.S. and the U.K., along with allies, have taken votes to the General Assembly after Russia blocked the Council from even taking measures up for consideration. President Biden's U.N. envoy, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield addressed reform that the U.S. is pursuing. ""The Secretary-General said that confronting this threat is the Security Council's charge. It is. And it is also the responsibility of U.N. leaders and leaders around the world — every single Member State with a voice in the General Assembly,"" she said. ""No one can be a shield for Russia's aggression,"" Thomas-Greenfield said, adding that ""suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council is something we, collectively, have the power to do in the General Assembly. Our votes can make real difference."" Russia's Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has denied the allegations, but was left frustrated on Monday when Britain, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council, blocked his country from calling a Council meeting on what he called the ""fake news"" out of Bucha. ""I deeply regret the divisions that have prevented the Security Council from acting not only on Ukraine, but on other threats to peace and security around the world,"" Guterres said Tuesday. Just back from a visit to Moscow to negotiate a humanitarian cease-fire, Martin Griffiths, Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, told diplomats that ""Ukrainian civilians are paying too high a price for war."" ""Almost 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes, of whom more than 4.2 million are now refugees in generous neighboring countries and beyond,"" Griffiths said. ""In total, more than a quarter of Ukraine's population has fled."" ""The horror deepened this past weekend as shocking images emerged of dead civilians, some with hands bound, lying in the streets of Bucha,"" said Rosemary DiCarlo, the U.N. Under Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding affairs.",45,4.739642943603755,4.107963647754814,0.631679295848941,1

Security Council diplomats outraged by growing evidence that Russian forces deliberately killed civilians, many of them shot in yards, streets and homes, and their bodies left in the open. ""Now the world can see what they have done in Bucha,"" Zelenskyy told the Security Council in an address delivered via live video. ""But the world has yet to see what Russia has done in other regions."" He accused Russia of ""the most terrible war crimes"" seen since the end of World War II. ""Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and airstrikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from hostilities. They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians hide from airstrikes,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine,"" he said, calling for reforms to make the international system more responsive. The Russian withdrawal from towns around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, revealed scores of corpses left behind, which led to calls for tougher sanctions against the Kremlin, especially a cutoff of gas and oil imports from Russia. Germany and France reacted by expelling dozens of Russian diplomats, suggesting they were spies. U.S. President Joe Biden said Russian leader Vladimir Putin should be tried for war crimes. ""This guy is brutal, and what's happening in Bucha is outrageous,"" Mr. Biden said, referring to the town northwest of the capital that was the scene of some of the horrors. At the Pentagon, a senior defense official said the U.S. can't independently confirm the atrocities in Bucha but has no reason to refute them. The official called the images ""deeply troubling."" The discovery of bodies in Bucha was expected to be ""front and center"" at the Security Council session, said Barbara Woodward, the U.N. ambassador for the United Kingdom, which holds the council presidency. Before Zelenskyy addressed the Security Council, members received briefings from Secretary-General Antonio Guterres; his political chief, Rosemary DiCarlo, and U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths, who is trying to arrange a cease-fire. Griffiths met with Russian officials in Moscow on Monday and is due to visit Ukraine. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta and her team went to Bucha on Monday and saw for themselves the unburied dead sprawled across the town. The slain were not wearing military uniforms. Many were undoubtedly civilians, some executed with their hands bound behind their backs. Some residents were even cut down by tanks as they rode on bicycles. Next to a church, Patta and her team saw a hastily dug mass grave — one of several in Bucha. The government said nearly 300 bodies had been discovered in the small town. The Ukrainian military released video of what it called a basement torture chamber, showing a line of people with their hands tied and gunshot wounds to the head. More evidence of Russian war crimes, said Ukraine. ""The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who among their fellow citizens killed, who gave orders, who turned a blind eye to the murders,"" Zelenskyy said as he visited the town on Monday. He appealed for more weaponry as Russia prepares new offensives. ""If we had already got what we needed — all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile and anti-ship weapons — we could have saved thousands of people,"" he said. On the CBS News broadcast ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Zelenskyy called the Russian actions ""genocide"" and called for the West to apply tougher sanctions against Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the scenes outside Kyiv as a ""stage-managed anti-Russian provocation."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the images contained ""signs of video forgery and various fakes."" Russia has rejected previous allegations of atrocities as fabrications by Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces. The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office described one room discovered in Bucha as a ""torture chamber."" In a statement, it said the bodies of five men with their hands bound were found in the basement of a children's sanatorium where civilians were tortured and killed. The bodies seen by AP journalists in Bucha included at least 13 in and around a building that local people said Russian troops used as a base. Three other bodies were found in a stairwell, and six were burned together. The dead witnessed by the news agency's journalists also included bodies wrapped in black plastic, piled on one end of the mass grave in a Bucha churchyard. Many of those victims had been shot in cars or killed in explosions trying to flee the city. With the morgue full and the cemetery impossible to reach, the churchyard was the only place to keep the dead, Father Andrii Galavin said. Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, insisted Monday at a news conference that during the time that Bucha was under Russian control, ""not a single local person has suffered from any violent action."" However, high-resolution satellite imagery by commercial provider Maxar Technologies showed that many of the bodies had been lying in the open for weeks, during the time when Russian forces were in Bucha. The New York Times first reported on the satellite images showing the dead. Western and Ukrainian leaders have accused Russia of war crimes before. The International Criminal Court's prosecutor has already opened an investigation. But the latest reports ratcheted up the condemnation. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the images from Bucha reveal the ""unbelievable brutality of the Russian leadership and those who follow its propaganda."" French President Emmanuel Macron said there is ""clear evidence of war crimes"" in Bucha that demand new punitive measures. ""I'm in favor of a new round of sanctions and in particular on coal and gasoline. We need to act,"" he said on France-Inter radio. Though united in outrage, the European allies appeared split on how to respond. While Poland urged Europe to quickly wean itself off Russian energy, Germany said it would stick with a gradual approach of phasing out coal and oil imports over the next several months. Russia withdrew many of its forces from the area around Kyiv after being thwarted in its bid to swiftly capture the capital. It has instead poured troops into eastern Ukraine in a stepped-up bid to gain control of the Donbas, the largely Russian-speaking industrial region that includes the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting and worst suffering of the war. About two-thirds of the Russian troops around Kyiv have left and are either in Belarus or on their way there, probably getting more supplies and reinforcements, said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence assessment. More than 1,500 civilians were able to escape Mariupol on Monday, using the dwindling number of private vehicles available to leave, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. But amid the fighting, a Red Cross-accompanied convoy of buses that has been thwarted for days in its bid to deliver supplies and evacuate residents was again unable to get inside the city, Vereshchuk said. Elsewhere, Russian shelling killed 11 people in the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said in a video message on social media.

2022-04-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-conflict-years-mark-milley-house-armed-services-committee/,"Top U.S. military officer expects Ukraine conflict to be ""measured in years""","The highest ranking military officer in the U.S. said Tuesday that he expects the conflict in Ukraine to last years. ""I do think this is a very protracted conflict, and I think it's measured in years. I don't know about decade, but at least years for sure,"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told the House Armed Services Committee Tuesday during testimony on the defense budget. ""This is a very extended conflict that Russia has initiated and I think that NATO, the United States, Ukraine and all of the allies and partners supporting Ukraine will be involved in this for quite some time,"" Milley said. Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin appeared before the committee for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in February and as Russia is refocusing on eastern Ukraine. The Pentagon has seen about two-thirds of the less than 20 Russian battalion tactical groups that were arrayed against Kyiv repostion north toward Belarus, according to a U.S. senior defense official.The assessment is Russia will refit, resupply, and potentially reinforce them with additional manpower before sending the units back into Ukraine, likely in the Donbas region. Ukraine has been fighting Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region since 2014. A senior defense official said last week that Russia's reprioritized focus in eastern Ukraine could mean the conflict takes more time instead of less because Ukrainian forces know the territory well, and they have a lot of forces there already who are fighting hard to defend the region. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a White House press briefing Monday that the next phase of the war in Ukraine ""may very well be protracted"" and if the Russians do achieve some success in the Donbas region, the forces could try to take other areas of Ukraine. To help Ukraine, the Biden administration is shipping weapons to Ukraine as quickly as possible and is working with partners who have equipment Ukraine wants that the U.S. doesn't have. Austin said Tuesday that the Pentagon continues to focus on assistance that the Ukrainians have used effectively like anti-aircraft and anti-armor weapons. He said the Pentagon is working to provide both Switchblade 300 and 600 drones to Ukraine quickly. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted questions about the U.S. force posture in Europe. Milley said Tuesday the posture of the U.S. is still being decided but because of the war in Ukraine, it's likely there will be an increased presence of U.S. troops in the region long term. ""My advice would be to create permanent bases but don't permanently station, so you get the effect of permanence by rotational forces cycling through permanent bases,"" Milley said. The U.S. currently has around 100,000 stationed troops in Europe, the highest number since 2005. As for the coming weeks, the Pentagon has seen indications Russia is looking to reapply the forces that repositioned away from Kyiv to the Donbas region but has not seen any evidence yet that those units have started to move into the Donbas, according to a senior defense official. A recent British military intelligence update said many Russian units withdrawing from northern Ukraine are likely to require significant re-equipping and refurbishment before being available to redeploy for operations in eastern Ukraine. Milley and Austin are scheduled to testify in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.",7,6.317067370315189,6.747552305282893,-0.430484934967704,27

What they've left behind is difficult to comprehend, and even more difficult to see. CBS News warns our readers that both the video report above and the article below contain disturbing material. Independent journalists who went into the town of Bucha, just northwest of the capital, over the weekend found the streets littered with bodies. The dead were wearing civilian clothing, and some had their hands tied behind their backs, apparently executed. Others were buried in a mass grave. More than 300 residents were killed, according to the town's mayor. In the central Ukrainian village of Kalynivka, closer to the southern and eastern Ukrainian cities Russia has hammered with artillery and air strikes for weeks, Irina Kostenko said the Russians killed her only son, Oleksei. She said she brought her son's body back home in a wheelbarrow and then buried him by herself in the garden, wrapped in a rug, in a shallow grave. He was killed at 27, but Kostenko clung to a photo of him as a child as she stood by his grave. ""This is my love, my sweetheart,"" she said. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports that Ukrainian officials shared photos taken on a highway outside the capital over the weekend showing the naked corpses of at least four women. The officials said Russian troops tried to burn the women's bodies. Human Rights Watch and other groups have documented cases of alleged rape by Russian troops during the invasion, which Vladimir Putin launched on February 24. Ukrainian officials are investigating. Speaking Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of committing genocide in his country. ""We are being destroyed and exterminated"" he said, ""and this is happening in the Europe of the 21st century."" On Monday, Zelenskyy visited Bucha to inspect the damage and speak with residents. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Interior Ministry, said the president found ""evidence of mass killings."" According to Geraschchenko, a BBC correspondent asked Zelenskyy if he still believed it would be possible to negotiate for peace with Russia. The president said it would, ""because Ukraine must find peace. We are in 21st century Europe. We will continue our diplomatic, and military efforts."" The southeast port city of Mariupol has been besieged and bombarded by the Russians for almost 40 days, since the war started. Thousands may have been killed there alone, according to the United Nations, but it's impossible to get an accurate picture because Mariupol has been cut off from the outside world. Ilona, 17, and her 10-year-old brother Milan made it out of the city on Friday with their parents. CBS News found them sitting silently at an evacuation center, apparently shell-shocked. ""There were constant bombing raids, constant explosions,"" Ilona told Williams. There were times they thought they would die in their city, but she said tried throughout the ordeal to ""hold ourselves together — we tried not to panic."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said almost two weeks ago that the U.S. had determined that Russian forces had committed ""war crimes"" in Ukraine, accusing them of ""indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians."" On Sunday, he told CNN the images from Bucha were ""a punch to the gut,"" and he said the U.S. was ""working to document"" and provide its own information ""to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together"" to ensure any forces guilty of war crimes would he held accountable. ""We can't normalize this,"" he said. ""This is the reality of what's going on every single day, as long as Russia's brutality against Ukraine continues. That's why it needs to come to an end."" On Monday, Russian officials denied civilians were killed in Bucha. The Russian defense ministry claimed the gruesome scenes in Bucha were faked by Ukrainian forces as a ""provocation."" It has become a common refrain from Moscow, issued after previous alleged atrocities came to light in this war, and during Russia's long involvement in Syria's brutal civil war. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the reports of what he called a ""fake attack"" in Bucha and said Russia was demanding ""an urgent meeting of the Security Council on this particular issue because we see such provocations as a direct threat to international peace and security."" But the United Nations human rights chief was among those voicing horror at the scenes from Bucha on Monday. ""I am horrified by the images of civilians lying dead on the streets and in improvised graves in the town of Bucha in Ukraine,"" the U.N.'s Michelle Bachelet said in a statement. ""Reports emerging from this and other areas raise serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law."" CBS News correspondent Pamela Falk at the U.N. said U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield had discussed with Romania's prime minister on Monday America's intention to try to get Russia's suspended from the U.N. Human Rights Council. According to a readout of Thomas-Greenfield's meeting with the Romanian leader, she said Russia's expulsion from the rights body was needed, ""in light of the mounting evidence that members of Russian forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine and following horrific reports about violence against civilians in Bucha."" Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, standing aside his Polish counterpart during a visit to Warsaw, said he was ""deeply shocked by news of the exceptionally cruel acts of violence against civilians near Kyiv."" ""The murder of innocent civilians is a violation of international humanitarian law and is unacceptable and I strongly condemn these acts,"" he added. ""The Russian assault is a blatant violation of international law."" In London, the head of Britain's equivalent of the CIA, MI6 chief Richard Moore, said in a tweet that Russia had planned mass-executions as part of its strategy in Ukraine. He shared an earlier message from the U.K. Foreign Secretary demanding that those responsible for the killings documented in Kyiv's suburbs be held to account. As Williams reported, the Russian soldiers accused of massacring unarmed civilians in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine will likely never be brought to justice. But despite the horrific images and thousands of his own soldiers being killed on the battlefield, a new poll in Russia found that Putin's approval rating had risen to 83% since the invasion began. While thousands have been arrested for protesting against the Ukraine war in Russian cities over the last month, many Russians rely entirely on the country's state-run news organizations for their information. Those outlets present only the Kremlin's version of what Putin calls the ""special military operation,"" and no Russian media outlets are free to report the truth about what's happening in Ukraine.",45,3.89013553659762,2.1780547061460283,1.7120808304515918,8

EDITOR's NOTE: This article includes images of dead bodies which may offend some readers. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Sunday that Sukhenko and her husband, who were reported to have been kidnapped by Russian troops on March 23, were ""killed in captivity."" One resident of the town, which sits in territory recently abandoned by Russia's forces about 31 miles west of Kyiv, told The Associated Press that Russian troops had targeted local officials in a bid to win them over and killed them if they did not collaborate.

""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Mr. Biden said, adding that Putin ""is a war criminal."" Mr. Biden's comments to reporters came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bucha, one of the towns surrounding Kyiv where Ukrainian officials say the bodies of civilians have been found. On ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Zelenskyy called the Russian actions ""genocide"" and called for the West to apply tougher sanctions against Russia. The president, however, stopped short of calling the actions genocide. The bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces, Ukraine's prosecutor-general, Iryna Venediktova, said. Associated Press journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha, northwest of the capital. ""We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight. And we have to gather all the detail so this can be an actual — have a war crimes trial,"" Mr. Biden said upon returning to Washington from a weekend trip to Delaware. The president lashed out at Putin as ""brutal."" ""What's happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone sees it,"" Mr. Biden added. At the Pentagon, a senior defense official said the U.S. can't independently confirm the atrocities in Bucha but has no reason to refute them. The official called the images ""deeply troubling."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted Monday that the European Union will send investigators to Ukraine to help the local prosecutor general ""document war crimes."" Mr. Biden noted that he faced push back last month when he described Putin as a war criminal for the unfolding onslaught in Ukraine after hospitals and maternity wards were bombed. In his remarks on Monday, Mr. Biden made clear that label still applied. ""This guy is brutal and what's happening to Bucha is outrageous, and everyone's seen it,"" the president said. Investigations into Putin's actions had begun before the new allegations of atrocities outside Kyiv. The U.S. and more than 40 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, after the passage of a resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council to establish a commission of inquiry. There is another probe by the International Criminal Court, an independent body based in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden's chief envoy to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, announced Monday that the U.S. plans to seek a suspension of Russia from its seat on the U.N.'s top human rights body in the wake of more indications Russian forces may have committed war crimes in Ukraine. That would require a decision by the U.N. General Assembly. Russia and the other four permanent members of the U.N.

The Reuters news agency, where he had long been a contributor, said Levin was killed covering the war for a Ukrainian news site. That news site, LB.ua, said Levin's body was found April 1 and that a colleague who was with him is still missing. Levin, 41, left behind a wife and four children. ""Maks has provided compelling photos and video from Ukraine to Reuters since 2013. His death is a huge loss to the world of journalism. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time,"" John Pullman, Reuters' global managing editor for visuals, said. Levin is the sixth journalist known to have died covering the Russian invasion, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. American filmmaker Brent Renaud was killed in mid-March, and days later a cameraman and a local producer working for Fox News were killed in an attack that seriously injured correspondent Benjamin Hall. ""We are deeply saddened by the news of photojournalist Maks Levin's death in Ukraine while he was reporting on the war in the Kyiv region,"" CPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in a statement. ""Ukrainian and Russian authorities must do everything in their power to investigate his death, ensure that those responsible are held accountable, and guarantee the safety of journalists covering the war from the ground."" Here is a look at some of the photographs Levin took documenting the war in his country in the final weeks of his life.",45,2.27966832132885,5.479303456562745,-3.199635135233895,0
2022-04-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-focus-mariupol-odesa/,Ukraine sees openings as Russians focus on besieged Mariupol,"Kyiv, Ukraine — Residents of Ukraine's besieged southeastern coast awaited possible evacuation Sunday as the country's president said Russia's obsession with capturing a key port city had left its forces weakened and created opportunities for his military. Two loud explosions were heard in Odesa on the Black Sea, and black smoke was seen rising above the city, which is where Ukraine's navy is headquartered. It is west of Mariupol, a smaller port that has been under attack for almost the entire war and rescuers are desperate to reach. The Odesa city council said in a brief statement that a morning airstrike set off fires in some areas. The Russian military said hours later that it used ships and aircraft-fired missiles to strike an oil processing plant and fuel depots that were supplying Ukrainian troops. The city council said Ukraine's air defense shot down some missiles before they hit the city. Ukrainian military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov said there were no casualties from the attack. In Mariupol, conditions remained dire and prospects for escape uncertain. The surrounded city, which has been brutalized by some of the war's worst attacks, reported weeks ago that water, food, fuel and medicine were running out. About 100,000 people are believed to still be there, less than a quarter of the city's prewar population of 430,000. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it hoped a team it sent to help evacuate residents would reach Mariupol on Sunday. Ukrainian authorities said Russia agreed days ago to allow safe passage from the city, but similar agreements have broken down repeatedly under continued shelling. Mariupol is in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian troops for eight years. Its capture would create an unbroken land corridor from Russia to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. With Mariupol squarely in Russia's crosshairs, Ukraine insists it has gained a leg up elsewhere in the country. As his country's troops retook territory north of the capital of Kyiv from departing Russian troops, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on all Ukrainians to do whatever they could ""to foil the enemy's tactics and weaken its capabilities."" ""Peace will not be the result of any decisions the enemy makes somewhere in Moscow. There is no need to entertain empty hopes that they will simply leave our land. We can only have peace by fighting,"" Zelenskyy said late Saturday. Zelenskyy and Ukraine's Western allies believe Russia has shifted its forces from the capital region and the country's north in order to build strength in the east and south. The Ukrainian leader again urged the West to supply his military with warplanes and more anti-missile systems. ""Every Russian missile that hits our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children, only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended — the decision of whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons,"" Zelenskyy said. While the geography of the battlefield morphed, little changed for many Ukrainians more than five weeks into a war that has sent more than 4 million people fleeing the country as refugees and displaced millions more from their homes. The regional governor in Kharkiv said Sunday that Russian artillery and tanks performed over 20 strikes on Ukraine's second-largest city and its outskirts in the country's northeast over the past day. Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said a missile strike on the city of Lozovo wounded four people and that Russian tanks bombarded a hospital in the town of Balakliia. Zelenskyy alleged Saturday that Russian troops have left mines around homes, abandoned equipment and even the bodies of the dead as they withdraw from around Kyiv. Those claims could not be independently verified, but Ukrainian troops were seen heeding the warning. In Bucha, northwest of the capital, Associated Press journalists watched as Ukrainian soldiers, backed by a column of tanks and other armored vehicles, used cables to drag bodies off of a street from a distance for fear they may have been booby-trapped. Locals said the dead — AP counted at least six — were civilians killed without provocation by departing Russian soldiers. In towns and cities surrounding Kyiv, signs of fierce fighting were everywhere in the wake of the Russian redeployment. Destroyed armored vehicles from both armies lay in streets and fields along with scattered military gear. Ukrainian troops were stationed at the entrance to Antonov Airport in the suburb of Hostomel, demonstrating control of the runway that Russia tried to storm in the first days of the war. Inside the compound, the Mriya, one of the biggest planes ever built, lay wrecked underneath a hangar pockmarked with holes from the February attack. The head of Ukraine's delegation in talks with Russia said Moscow's negotiators informally agreed to most of a draft proposal discussed during face-to-face talks in Istanbul this week, but no written confirmation has been provided. The Ukrainian negotiator, Davyd Arakhamia said on Ukrainian TV that he hoped the plan was developed enough so that the two countries' presidents can meet to discuss it. Ukrainian authorities warned that Russia's focus on eastern Ukraine did not mean Kyiv and other cities wouldn't become targets again. In his evening address Saturday, Zelenskyy called for his people to do whatever they can to ensure the country's survival, even by engaging in acts as simple as showing each other kindness. ""When a nation is defending itself in a war of annihilation, when it is a question of life or death of millions, there are no unimportant things. ... And everyone can contribute to a victory for all,"" the president said.",47,3.6673731138369456,1.7878984566297702,1.8794746572071754,19
2022-04-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/putins-endgame-war-in-ukraine/,What is Putin's endgame now?,"Just over five weeks into the war, and one thing is clear about how it will end – there will be no surrender. ""There will be a negotiated settlement, I think. but clearly there's still a lot of fighting going on as each side tries to create conditions that give it more leverage at the negotiating table,"" said former CIA director and commander of America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, retired Army General David Petraeus. He says the Russians have already lost the battle for Kyiv: ""They will not be able to accomplish what was presumably their main objective from the outset, which was to topple the Zelensky government and replace it with a pro-Russian government."" CBS News national security correspondent David Martin asked, ""If the plan to take Kyiv has failed, has the decisive battle of the war already been fought?"" ""Only if Ukraine can prevent another decisive battle from being fought again,"" Petraeus replied. ""This could be pivotal in the sense that it's perilous for Ukraine."" The peril now looms in Eastern Ukraine, where Russia is reinforcing and concentrating its firepower in an attempt to encircle much of Ukraine's army. The outcome of the vicious battle for the city of Mariupol could be the key. Petraeus said, ""Mariupol has become the Ukrainian Alamo, fighting to the last defender, tying down considerable number of Russian battalions and making them pay for literally every block that they're taking. Once that does eventually fall, as tragically it appears will be the case, that will free up a number of Russian forces."" ""If [Putin] were to destroy the Ukrainian army in the East, would then the rest of the country be open to him?"" Martin asked. ""I don't think so,"" he replied. ""You're fighting an entire nation. There will be limits to how far they can go, and I don't expect that it would go more than the middle of the country. They'd love to get to the very center."" ""Is it possible the Ukrainians could hold out?"" ""If they can get the additional weapons, ammo, vehicles and so forth, absolutely, no question,"" said Petraeus. ""And of course, they have this unbelievable determination, fortitude, creativity, resourcefulness. They're everything the Russians are not."" President Zelensky, who has proved himself not just a brilliant communicator in chief but a savvy commander in chief, says the war is at a turning point. Martin asked, ""Would you say it's going to take weeks or months for this to play out?"" ""It could be weeks; it could be months, depending on how bad the damage is,"" said Petraeus. ""You're basically describing a war of attrition?"" ""There is a war of attrition that's going on, and again it's not just on the battlefield. It's also to a degree between what's happening in Ukraine and what's happening to Moscow and to the Russian economy, financial system, and business community."" And a war between two men, said Petraeus: ""Between Vladimir Putin, who cannot seem to appear weak – he has to remain the strongman, infallible, unflappable, in control, the master of everything; and President Zelensky, who is leading a country that is fighting for its very survival."" U.S. officials say one of them – Putin – is not being told the truth about what is happening on the battlefield. ""How does a war end when the leader isn't being told the truth?"" asked Martin. ""Well, the leader isn't dumb,"" Petraeus said. ""He has to recognize the reality of what has happened. They did not achieve what they set out to achieve. Deep down, he realizes that he has plunged his country into a colossal mistake, and has demonstrated colossal misjudgment."" ""Will he be sufficiently chastened so that he doesn't try something like this again?"" ""I don't know that he will think that he is sufficiently chastened,"" Petraeus replied. ""What he will be is sufficiently – we hope – sufficiently weakened."" Story produced by Mary Walsh. Editor: George Pozderec.",7,4.959214354678587,3.6094399531236316,1.3497744015549555,24
2022-04-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-bucha-atrocities-civilians-russia/,Ukraine documents alleged atrocities by retreating Russians,"Bucha, Ukraine — Ukraine's troops found brutalized bodies with bound hands, gunshot wounds to the head and signs of torture after Russian soldiers withdrew from the outskirts of Kyiv, authorities said Sunday, sparking new calls for a war crimes investigation and sanctions against Russia. Associated Press journalists in Bucha, a small city northwest of the capital, saw the bodies of at least nine people in civilian clothes who appeared to have been killed at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs. The AP also saw two bodies wrapped in plastic, bound with tape and thrown into a ditch. Authorities said they were documenting evidence of alleged atrocities to add to their case for prosecuting Russian officials for war crimes. To convict, International Criminal Court prosecutors will need to show a pattern of indiscriminate deadly assaults on civilians during Russia's invasion. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said scores of residents were found slain on the streets of Bucha and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel in what looked like a ""scene from a horror movie."" Some people were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some bodies showed signs of torture, Arestovych said. There also were reports of rapes, he said. Zelenskyy told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that the Russians were committing ""genocide"" in Ukraine and called for Russia to be held accountable for war crimes. ""When we find people with hands tied behind their back and decapitated, such things I don't understand,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I don't comprehend the kids who were killed and tortured. So it wasn't enough just to kill for those criminals. Maybe they wanted to take gold or washing machines and they were killing, but they were also torturing them as they did this."" The capital city's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said civilians were ""shot with joined hands"" and told German newspaper Bild that ""what happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide."" A day earlier, AP journalists witnessed Ukrainian soldiers gingerly removing at least six bodies from a street in Bucha with cables in case the Russians had booby-trapped corpses with explosives before their withdrawal. Local residents said the dead people were civilians killed without provocation, a claim that could not be independently verified. ""What happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide,"" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told German newspaper Bild. Klitschko called on other nations to immediately end Russian gas imports, saying they were funding the killings. ""Not a penny should go to Russia anymore. That's bloody money used to slaughter people. The gas and oil embargo must come immediately,"" the mayor said. Russian troops moved into Ukraine from three sides on February 24, and soldiers who entered from the north in Belarus spent weeks trying to clear a path to Kyiv. Their advance stalled in the face of resolute defiance from Ukraine's defenders, and Moscow said this week it would concentrate the invasion elsewhere going forward. Signs of fierce fighting were everywhere in the wake of Russian troops retreating north to back to Belarus: destroyed armored vehicles from both armies lay in streets and fields along with scattered military gear. The Ukrainian military said its troops continued to comb areas outside of the capital for mines, the dead and for any lingering Russian fighters. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also called for tougher sanctions on Russia, including a complete energy embargo, over the discoveries north of Kyiv. Kuleba tweeted Sunday that the ""Bucha massacre was deliberate,"" alleging the ""Russians aim to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can."" Charles Michel, president of the European Council, wrote on Twitter that he was shocked by the ""haunting images of atrocities committed by Russian army"" in the capital region. The EU and non-governmental organizations were assisting in the effort to preserve evidence of war crimes, according to Michel, who promised ""further EU sanctions"" against Russia. The foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the U.K. separately condemned what was being described and said Russia would be held accountable. ""We will not allow Russia to cover up their involvement in these atrocities through cynical disinformation and will ensure that the reality of Russia's actions are brought to light,″ British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said. As Russia retreated from the capital, other parts of the country were under siege. Russia has said it is directing troops to eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years. Nearly two weeks ago, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. had determined that Russian forces had committed ""war crimes"" in Ukraine, accusing them of ""indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians."" ""Russia's forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded,"" Blinken said. ""Many of the sites Russia's forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians.""",45,3.7639666425747658,3.010434233302088,0.7535324092726778,8
2022-04-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ukrainian-president-warns-retreating-russian-forces-leaving-mines-kyiv/,Ukrainian president warns that retreating Russian forces are leaving mines,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned his people early Saturday that retreating Russian forces were creating ""a complete disaster"" outside the capital, Kyiv, as they leave mines across ""the whole territory,"" even around homes and corpses. ""They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. ""There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers."" He urged residents to wait to resume their normal lives until they are assured that the mines have been cleared and the danger of shelling has passed. Zelenskyy issued the warning as the humanitarian crisis in the encircled port city of Mariupol deepened, with Russian forces blocking evacuation operations for the second day in a row, and the Kremlin accused the Ukrainians of launching a helicopter attack on a fuel depot on Russian soil. Ukraine denied responsibility for the fiery blast, but if Moscow's claim is confirmed, it would be the war's first known attack in which Ukrainian aircraft penetrated Russian airspace. ""Certainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, five weeks after Moscow began sending upwards of 150,000 of its own troops across Ukraine's border. Russia continued withdrawing some of its ground forces from areas around Kyiv after saying earlier this week it would reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital and the northern city of Chernihiv. The mayor of a town just outside of Kyiv called Bucha told AFP reporters on Saturday that the Ukrainian army retook control of the commuter town from the Russians. Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk said corpses fill the streets of the heavily destroyed town, and the dead are being buried in mass graves. ""In Bucha, we have already buried 280 people in mass graves,"" Fedoruk told AFP by phone. In Kyiv, there is relief that Ukraine has managed to halt Russia's advance on the capital for now – but they are not letting down their guard. Many there are convinced it could be short-lived, CBS News' Debora Patta reports. From soldiers like Sergei defending Kyiv, there's only contempt for Russia's claim it dramatically reduced operations near the capital. Sergei said he doesn't believe Russia and that maybe it's just a retreat in preparation for a stronger attack. Sergei last picked up a gun 25 years ago during his conscription. In a few weeks, his son turns 18 and will join him in the fight — Russian brutality serving only to strengthen their resolve. Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table, as it claimed, but instead resupplying and shifting its troops to the country's east. Those movements appear to be preparation for an intensified assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the country's east, which includes the city of Mariupol. There are still more than 150,000 residents left inside that city — unable or unwilling to leave as Russian tanks continue to pound what's left of it. On Saturday, another Red Cross convoy will attempt to evacuate more residents from the city, which has been under siege for five weeks.",47,2.0769027581904558,2.497669821997081,-0.42076706380662543,11

Speaking to Maltese authorities Saturday, Francis said: ""We had thought that invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past."" Francis has to date avoided referring to Russia or Putin by name.

Ukraine's president told his people Wednesday night that the fight to repel Russia's invasion had reached a ""turning point,"" and he asked the U.S. for more weapons and other assistance to turn the tide. In a late-night video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cast doubt on Russia's stated decision to ""drastically reduce"" attacks around Kyiv and the northeast city of Chernihiv. He said Russian forces were building up in his country's eastern Donbas regions in preparation for a major offensive there. Russia has made it clear that it will shift the focus of its ""special military operation"" to Donbas. U.S. officials believe units that Russia is pulling back from Kyiv will be refitted for use elsewhere in Ukraine, but given the damage sustained by Russian forces during the first month of Putin's war, making the equipment battle-ready again could take weeks. A British intelligence chief said Thursday that Russian forces were suffering from shortages of both ""weapons and morale,"" leading some to sabotage their own equipment and refuse to follow orders. He said the seemingly poorly trained and equipped troops had even accidentally shot down their own aircraft. The assessment by Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency, that Putin had ""massively misjudged the situation"" in Ukraine, came a day after U.S. officials said intelligence showed Putin had been misled by his own military commanders about the difficulties Russia was encountering. Ukrainian forces have held Vladimir Putin's ground forces to a stalemate. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reported from near the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, next to a burned-out Russian military vehicle, there's evidence even in Ukraine's artillery-battered south of Putin's stalled invasion.",7,2.758762624714959,2.1440914689375044,0.6146711557774545,21

The regional governor said two Ukrainian helicopters attacked the fuel facility in Belgorod, about 20 miles inside Russia, and video showed storage tanks in flames. A U.S. official confirmed to CBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin that Ukrainian helicopters did carry out the strike, and anther one a couple days earlier against an ammunition depot in the same area. The official told Martin there was concern in Washington about how Russia might react to the strikes. Ukrainian officials did not claim responsibility for the attack themselves, but as CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports, it was a significant move by Ukraine's forces. Russian forces have continued attacking Ukrainian cities. They were accused of blocking food and medical supplies from getting into the besieged southern port city of Mariupol on Thursday, and of blocking refugees from getting out despite Moscow agreeing to open a humanitarian corridor. Russia has pummeled Mariupol and other southern and eastern Ukrainian cities with artillery and airstrikes for more than a month, but attempts to push deeper into the country with ground forces hit a wall, and in some places, they've been pushed back. Just west of Zaporizhzhia, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams met some of the Ukrainian forces who stood in their way. In the farming village of Mala Shesternia, as in most of Ukraine, the Russian soldiers were unwelcome invaders. The residents have fled, but Colonel Serhii Romashko told CBS News his men recaptured Mala Shesternia five days ago, killing some Russians and capturing others. Their clothes and shoes are still there, even their cooking pots. Romashko said the Russians were used as cannon fodder — sent in with so little food that they looted from the locals. One of the most notable Russian movements this week was confirmed on Thursday by Ukraine's national nuclear plant operator, Energoatom, which said the last of the Russian forces that had occupied the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant had pulled out. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian troops who dug trenches in the still-contaminated forest around Chernobyl had been exposed to radiation, but there was no immediate confirmation of reports that many were sickened. The global nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said Thursday that it was still assessing the situation at Chernobyl but it had ""not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation"" in the exclusion zone around the plant. The Russian troops from Chernobyl were reportedly headed toward Ukraine's border with Belarus. U.S. and British officials said this week that, while the Putin regime said it would ""drastically reduce"" military operations around Kyiv and the northeast city of Chernihiv to facilitate ongoing peace talks, Russia was really expected to regroup its battered forces in Belarus and other places under its control to stage a new offensive in eastern Ukraine's Donbas regions. As Williams reported, the Russians have war machines Ukraine can only dream of, but Ukraine's forces are destroying them, including two armored personnel carriers she saw on a single stretch of road near Mala Shesternia. Colonel Romashko told her three Russians miraculously escaped from one of the destroyed vehicles, and they're now being treated in a Ukrainian hospital. ""We'll defeat them,"" he said. ""I feel victorious."" Ukraine's resistance has also driven back the Russians from the town of Irpin, just north of Ukraine's capital Kyiv. But the cost is clear to see, with a row of body bags lined up along a city street this week — people slaughtered in what Vladimir Putin calls his ""special military operation."" In Mala Shesternia, the Russians also left behind deadly weapons, including a field carpeted with anti-tank mines. An undetonated rocket propelled grenade sat in the front yard of a home. Putin sent his soldiers in to capture a country that wants only to be free — and his war is killing both Ukrainians and Russians.",47,1.9314921167348875,2.9140466940927094,-0.9825545773578219,19
2022-04-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-donbas-fighting-expected-to-intensify/,U.S. expects fighting to intensify in Donbas region of Ukraine,"U.S. officials expect the fighting to become more intense as Russia's main effort shifts to the Donbas region because more forces will be concentrated in a smaller geographic area. The officials consider Mariupol, in southeastern Ukraine, as the linchpin. If and when it falls, the Russians will be on the left flank of the Ukrainian armed forces who have been fighting in the Donbas. Control of Mariupol would give Russia access to a major port, and it would create a land bridge extending from the Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, to Crimea, in the south, allowing Russia to open up its resupply lines. The Russian defense ministry earlier this week announced it would reprioritize eastern Ukraine over its efforts in the North, specifically against Chernihiv and Kyiv, the capital. The Pentagon has seen indications that a small number of Russian forces are moving north from Kyiv, likely to refit and resupply the units for use elsewhere in Ukraine, including potentially the Donbas, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said in a briefing this week. Since the beginning of the invasion, the Pentagon assessed the goal of some Russian lines of assault against Kharkiv and Mariupol were an attempt to section off the east and trap the Ukrainian troops fighting in the Donbas, so they would not be able to help defend other areas. So far, the Russians have been unsuccessful. They have failed to take Kharkiv and have surrounded Mariupol for at least the past week without winning control. A senior U.S. defense official said on Thursday that the Ukrainians are fighting very hard inside Mariupol to keep Russia from a complete takeover. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said this week that the Russians have become much more active in the Donbas region. There are about 1,000 mercenaries from the Wagner Group dedicated to the Donbas, and the Russians have prioritized airstrikes in the region. It remains to be seen whether the refitting and repositioning of troops will make a difference. As the battle map shifts, the U.S. continues to ship in military equipment to the Ukrainians. Weapons included in the $800 million security assistance package recently approved by President Biden have started to arrive in the region. A U.S. official says switchblade drones are scheduled to arrive Friday. The drones are equipped with a javelin anti-tank warhead to hit armored tanks.

But, Mr. Biden added, ""I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence."" A U.S. official said Wednesday that U.S. intelligence officials had determined that Putin was being misinformed by his advisers about the poor performance of Kremlin troops in Ukraine. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that recently declassified intelligence indicated that Putin is aware of the situation on information coming to him, and there is now persistent tension between him and senior Russian military officials. Earlier this week, Moscow said it would ""drastically reduce"" its military operations in two areas of the country to ""increase mutual trust"" and encourage peace talks. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy late Wednesday cast doubt on Russia's stated decision to ""drastically reduce"" attacks around Kyiv and the northeast city of Chernihiv. Mr. Biden on Thursday, too, seemed dubious about the claim that Putin is pulling back his forces. In fact, Mr. Biden said, there is evidence Putin is building up troops in the Donbass region in the east. ""Thus far, there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all of his forces out of Kyiv,"" Mr. Biden said. ""There is also evidence that he's beefing up his troops down in the Donbass area. Depending on your view of Putin — I'm a little skeptical.""

Ukraine's president told his people Wednesday night that the fight to repel Russia's invasion had reached a ""turning point,"" and he asked the U.S. for more weapons and other assistance to turn the tide. In a late-night video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cast doubt on Russia's stated decision to ""drastically reduce"" attacks around Kyiv and the northeast city of Chernihiv. He said Russian forces were building up in his country's eastern Donbas regions in preparation for a major offensive there. Russia has made it clear that it will shift the focus of its ""special military operation"" to Donbas. U.S. officials believe units that Russia is pulling back from Kyiv will be refitted for use elsewhere in Ukraine, but given the damage sustained by Russian forces during the first month of Putin's war, making the equipment battle-ready again could take weeks. A British intelligence chief said Thursday that Russian forces were suffering from shortages of both ""weapons and morale,"" leading some to sabotage their own equipment and refuse to follow orders. He said the seemingly poorly trained and equipped troops had even accidentally shot down their own aircraft. The assessment by Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency, that Putin had ""massively misjudged the situation"" in Ukraine, came a day after U.S. officials said intelligence showed Putin had been misled by his own military commanders about the difficulties Russia was encountering. Ukrainian forces have held Vladimir Putin's ground forces to a stalemate. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reported from near the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, next to a burned-out Russian military vehicle, there's evidence even in Ukraine's artillery-battered south of Putin's stalled invasion. Williams and her team traveled Wednesday with a convoy of Ukrainian soldiers — volunteers from all walks of life — as they headed to reinforce the front line near Kherson. Andriy Rogalski was a crane operator until he signed up earlier this month. He had just two weeks of basic training and told CBS News that he was frightened he could be killed, but that he and the others heading into battle had quashed their fears, because they know what they're fighting for. ""It's pure evil what they did,"" he said of Russia's relentless artillery and missile strikes. The attacks have hit hospitals, apartment buildings, schools and civilians just walking down the road. The U.S. says it's seen clear evidence that Putin's forces are committing war crimes. The United Nations has said thousands of civilians may have been killed in the besieged port city of Mariupol alone. There was hope that more of the estimated 160,000 civilians trapped in that city would be evacuated on Thursday, with Russia agreeing to allow a humanitarian corridor and Ukraine sending about 40 buses in to take people out. But previous corridors have collapsed, with both sides blaming the other for violating ceasefires. Russia is taking heavy losses in the face of a much tougher Ukrainian resistance than many expected. A NATO official estimated that between 7,0000 and 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in just over a month, but Moscow dismisses the tally as an attempt to demoralize Russian forces. Russian officials say the country has lost fewer than 1,400 troops in Ukraine. Crane-operator-turned soldier Andriy Rogalski said he believed Putin's war was a tragedy for both Ukrainians and Russians, and that the Russian president was behaving more like a mafia boss than a world leader. Second Lieutenant Tatiana Chornovol has front-line experience of Russia's military capabilities. A former politician and a mother of two, Chonovol is now tasked with taking out Russian tanks. ""The Russians are fighting stupidly,"" she told CBS News. ""They don't have a strategy or tactics, they're falling into the same traps, and their commanders are just pushing them to advance."" More than 4 million people have fled from Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion on February 24, according to the United Nations. U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet says 1,189 civilian deaths have been confirmed, including 98 children, but her agency says the true toll is much higher.",7,2.5118859257659456,6.18442107232071,-3.672535146554764,21

As the U.S. predicted Russia was ready to invade Ukraine, France preferred to believe it wouldn't go that far. Early in March, the head of France's armed forces, General Thierry Burkhard, admitted there had been very different interpretations of available intelligence. ""The Americans said that the Russians were going to attack, and they were right,"" he told Le Monde newspaper. ""Our services thought instead that the cost of conquering Ukraine would be colossal and that Russia had other options"" to bring down the regime of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On Wednesday, General Eric Vidaud quit his post as head of French military intelligence. French media reports said he was to be moved to another service this summer as part of an organizational reshuffle, but he preferred to quit now. Vidaud had only been in the job for seven months, following two years as head of Special Operations. He was previously posted to the French Defense Ministry, working closely with the then Defense Minister Yves Le Drian (now Foreign Minister). Prior to that he was commander of the 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment. Reports suggested that French intelligence on Russian plans lagged behind that of the U.S. and Britain – but as both Washington and London opted to publicly release much of their intelligence, there was criticism that France's own military intelligence agency had failed to accurately interpret it. That, as French president Emmanuel Macron continued to push for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. As he returned from an in-person visit with the Russian president in Moscow in February, just ahead of the invasion, Macron told journalists that Vladimir Putin had changed considerably since he last saw him in 2019, before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Sources at Macron's office said at the time that Putin seemed clearly ""paranoid,"" and suggested it would be much more difficult to predict his movements than they had previously believed.",7,3.429733673814181,5.994141727499519,-2.564408053685338,0

Gov. Tim Walz wants to dedicate $21 million to help protect the state's services and infrastructure. ""It's a hostile environment in the cyber space,"" said Rohit Tandon, Minnesota IT Services assistant commissioner and chief information security officer. Here in Minnesota, it's not just Russia we're defending against. It's organized crime units and other nation states, too. ""There's a continuous defensive posture that we must maintain,"" Tandon said. And there's a lot to look after. Cybersecurity takes millions of dollars and thousands of employees to watch over critical state agencies like the Minnesota Department of Human Services, Department of Transportation and Department of Public Safety. And if you think breaches don't happen in the U.S., think again. ""We've seen some big ones over the last year to name a few, Colonial Pipeline, JBS foods, that was very close to home,"" Tandon said. We asked Tandon about critical infrastructure like the energy grid or our water supply: Who is keeping an eye on that? ""We're always open to having dialogue about the threats, we're seeing and sharing that intelligence with them,"" Tandon said. ""But I think they are an independent entity that is responsible for taking actions to defend and protect that infrastructure that they are responsible for."" Xcel Energy says it's working with state and federal partners to closely monitor threats from Russia. St. Paul Regional water services gets alerts from those same partners if there's a serious concern. It also pays pros to stress test its systems to expose vulnerabilities. Those vulnerabilities evolve with the times -- from email phishing during pandemic lockdowns to targeted attacks during the civil unrest of 2020. ""We had multiple cyber hacktivists, if I may use that term, targeting to trying to disrupt through denial of service attacks,"" Tandon said. ""Resources such as unemployment insurance, health benefits, even how we provide drivers license services.' And as those potential breaches loom, Tandon says, now is the time to double down. ""It is a challenge we continue to deal with,"" Tandon said. Tandon says his department offers daily briefings for all county partners to talk through current threats. There's also federal funding for broader counties, cities and townships that the governor is looking to match if his budget proposal is approved.",20,6.729263792749389,4.072806674381299,2.65645711836809,16

Despite the ongoing negotiations, the war continues. As of Wednesday, the United Nations said it had driven more than 4 million people to flee Ukraine, upending their lives and making them refugees. At least 6 million more Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes to seek safety elsewhere inside the country. As CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports from the capital city of Kyiv — one of the areas where Russia said it would scale back its assault — U.S. military officials see President Vladimir Putin's latest move more as a repositioning of forces than a retreat, and in Kyiv and elsewhere, the threat remained high on Wednesday. Boardroom discussions like Tuesday's peace talks in Turkey mean little on the battlefield. Patta says Ukrainians are not letting their guard down, with soldiers continuing to patrol checkpoints around Kyiv, on high alert as they search for Russian saboteurs. With shelling still heard north of the capital on Wednesday morning ,it was clear that the danger still lurks on the ground, and in the sky. ""The enemy is still here,"" President Volodomyr Zelenskyy told his country on Wednesday night, after Russia's announcement. ""Missile and air attacks have not stopped… that's the reality."" Few places have felt that more than the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has all but collapsed. Even if peace is given a chance, all that's left of Mariupol is rubble and ruin. Children from the besieged city, and many others like it in Ukraine's south and east, want their childhoods back. ""I'm so tired,"" said one little girl. ""And my toys have no batteries in them."" Older Ukrainians just want to forget. ""What else can I do,"" asked Genaidy as he gathered what he could from his damaged apartment to flee Mariupol. ""There's nothing left for me here."" He's walking away after nearly 40 years working as a shoemaker in the city. Russian-backed separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine — where the war now raging had simmered quietly since Putin's last invasion in 2014 — are in no mood for peace. Video emerged showing rebels forcing Ukrainians to strip down, claiming they were searching for Nazi tattoos. In nearby Mykolaiv, a Russian rocket ripped through a government building on Tuesday, leaving a gaping hole, and fresh trauma. One woman watched helplessly as her colleague died in her arms — one of 12 people killed in the strike according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. Even if the Russian military does make good on its promise to pull back from Kyiv, in the towns around the capital, where fierce battles have been raging, there's not much left to fight for. While Ukraine claims to have retaken nearby towns like Irpin, those areas have been decimated, and many people did not make it out alive. The U.K. said Wednesday that its latest intelligence did show some Russian troops pulling back from the outskirts of Kyiv into Belarus and Russia, ""to reorganize and resupply"" after suffering heavy losses. The Ukrainian government said it expected Russia to retain some troops near the capital, to keep the pressure on and prevent Ukraine's forces from heading to the eastern front, where the war is still raging. Zelenskyy, along with the U.S. and his other Western partners, have made it clear they'll believe Russia's claim to be easing the assault on Kyiv and the northeastern city of Chernihiv when they see it happen, and not before. Thirty-five days into an invasion that Putin insisted for months he had no intention of launching, the skepticism was unsurprising. On Wednesday morning, the governor of Chernihiv said his region was ""shelled all night"" by Russian artillery: ""Civil infrastructure has been destroyed again, libraries, shopping malls and other facilities have been destroyed, and many houses have been destroyed.""",47,6.561982123697989,2.6085642809470952,3.953417842750894,21
2022-03-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-syria-putin-assad/,Was Putin's playbook for Ukraine written in Syria?,"As Russian missiles bombard Ukrainian cities and the U.S. secretary of state has called Russia's actions in Ukraine ""war crimes,"" an eyewitness to crimes against humanity in Syria says he fears for the Ukrainian people because he knows what the Russian president is capable of. He saw it in his own country. ""I see the news coming out of Ukraine, my heart hurts because I know what Russia has done in Ukraine — what it can do — because I know what it's done in Syria,"" said one Syrian eyewitness, who spoke with CBS News' investigative unit in his first U.S. television interview. The eyewitness' account is echoed by Stephen Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes. Rapp told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin crafted his Ukraine playbook years ago in Syria, when his longtime ally President Bashar Al-Assad cracked down on the pro-democracy movement. More than 250,000 civilians have died in the more than decadelong, brutal Syrian civil war that followed the Arab Spring movement in 2011. ""When it looked like Assad was going to be overthrown by his own people, the Russians came all in and joined in the bombardment of hospitals and civilian neighborhoods,"" Rapp said. With Russia's support, Assad remains in power amid allegations of widespread crimes against humanity. ""We have to recognize the critical role that Russia played in the crimes committed by the Assad regime and crimes, so horrendous that the UN stopped counting the dead at 400,000 years ago,"" Rapp said. Earlier this month on Capitol Hill, the Syrian eyewitness, known only as ""the Gravedigger"" to protect his identity because of ongoing security threats to him and his family, shared his first-hand account of two mass graves in Syria. ""Twice a week, multiple trailer trucks would come and each truck would have upwards of 100 to 400 or more bodies,"" he said. ""They were tortured to death, you could see clearly the signs of torture on their bodies. … This was a systematic machinery of death."" He pointed CBS News to a site near the Syrian capital called Al Qutayfah, where satellite images show its transformation from a barren field to a series of trenches. ""Everything that was going on, the mass graves, were systematic and were part of what the Assad regime wanted to do,"" he said. In a landmark decision in January, a German court found a former Syrian colonel, Anwar Raslan, guilty of crimes against humanity, based on the Gravedigger's account and other evidence. Syrian refugee Omar Al-Shogre thought he would never make it out of jail alive. Showing a cigarette burn on his fingers, Shogre described the physical and emotional torture he endured during his three years in Syrian detention. He said the regime kept meticulous records of the prisoners who died around him. ""I numbered hundreds of bodies, if not thousands of bodies,"" he told CBS News. ""This human part of you disappears in order for you to survive."" Several Americans have disappeared in Syria, including journalist Austin Tice, humanitarian aid worker Layla Shweikani and psychologist Majd Kamalmaz. Shogre, now a student at Georgetown University, said he still fears for his life. ""We talked to the FBI, we talked to other, you know, war crimes committees in different countries because I expect myself to be killed at any day,"" he said. Seven years after his mother helped him escape from Syria, Shogre is now an advocate for human rights. Last month, he reunited with his sister, showing that it's possible to thread the needle of despair and stitch together hope and purpose. ""I can cry for 100,000 years for what I went through. It won't even be enough, right? But I am going to tell everyone to tell the story of the Syrian people through me,"" Shogre said. ""What is the benefit of your power, if you don't use it for good?"" While the evidence is overwhelming, the Syrian president has repeatedly denied crimes against his own people. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia's attacks on civilians in Ukraine are war crimes. Putin's spokesman has ""categorically rejected"" the war crimes allegation, in a move that also follows the playbook from Syria. ""You could kill your way out of it,"" Rapp, the former ambassador, said. ""And that's the lesson that Russia has taken to heart too as it commits these crimes in Ukraine.""",45,5.256817109181826,3.8078157226158194,1.4490013865660067,25

Turkish officials had said the latest round of direct negotiations, aimed at crafting an agreement for a ceasefire, could begin as soon as Monday, but a spokesman for the Kremlin in Moscow said it would likely be Tuesday. Despite the ongoing negotiations between the two sides, the fighting continues. Over the weekend, Russia seemingly focused its efforts on capturing territory in Ukraine's east, including the devastated city of Mariupol. Vladimir Putin's forces have failed to take the city, and many others, despite weeks of relentless bombing. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta met residents of the besieged port city who managed to escape to a town near the capital, where Ukraine's president offered a message to Russian media. In the unusual interview with Russia's government-controlled news outlets, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to four prominent journalists from the country, detailing the horrors of the war being waged on Ukraine. The Kremlin promptly banned any Russian outlets from reporting what he said or using video of the interview, but it was broadcast outside the country. Patta said that, given what she and her team have seen on the ground, it's no wonder the Putin regime didn't want the Zelenskyy interview aired in Russia. Plumes of black smoke choked the sky over the weekend after a Russian cruise missile slammed into a fuel depot in the western city of Lviv. Firefighters battled for 12 hours to put out the blaze. The fighting and artillery fire intensified around Kyiv, too, leaving battle-scarred landscapes around the capital. But it is the apocalyptic scenes from Mariupol that really show the extent of the human toll of Russia's war in Ukraine. Patta met Valentina, who was born, married and was raising her children in a house in the southern city. Her lifetime of memories was reduced to rubble along with her home. ""What is left for us?"" she asked through sobs. ""There's nowhere to live here now."" Alexander stayed behind, and is just grateful to be alive. ""I survived,"" he told his daughter in a message, breaking down in tears. ""Thank God… your dad is alive."" Victoria Medynska remained in the hell of Mariupol for three weeks before finally making the death-defying car trip out of the city. She escaped to the town of Brovary, on the outskirts of Kyiv. All she has left of her life in Mariupol are precious photos and videos stored on her phone. ""I cried, because – it's hard to speak, I'm sorry,"" she told Patta, unable to recount the terror she left behind. Russian airstrikes and artillery have left the street that Medynska and her family called home a ruin of broken concrete and twisted metal. Her daughter Masha, just seven years old, remembers everything, including the fear. Her school was bombed, and her childhood shattered. One year ago, Masha celebrated her birthday surrounded by laughter. On Sunday, it was a very different celebration as Masha turned seven – no longer a carefree schoolgirl, but one of the 4 million children displaced by this war. ""I had so many friends,"" she told Patta. ""Now I have no friends."" A humanitarian corridor was opened briefly on Sunday, allowing the evacuation of just over 500 more people from Mariupol, but officials say there are still around 160,000 people trapped there, and they're running very low on food and water.",47,2.308121410233631,3.271523495793752,-0.9634020855601211,11

2022-03-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-white-phosphorus-russia-ukraine/,"What is white phosphorus, and what does it mean that Russia may be using it in Ukraine?","London — Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a NATO summit on Thursday that Russia had used white phosphorus against civilians in his country. ""This morning, by the way, phosphorus bombs were used. Russian phosphorus bombs. Adults were killed again and children were killed again,"" Zelenskyy said. Their use has not been independently confirmed, but the news caused concern that Russia may be escalating its tactics by unleashing a particularly destructive and disturbing type of weaponry as its ground invasion of the country stalls due to logistical problems and fierce Ukrainian resistance. White phosphorus is a wax-like chemical substance, often yellowish or colorless, that some people say smells like garlic. It ignites instantly when it comes into contact with oxygen, and its primary function in weaponry is to burn, fast and bright. It is used in incendiary munitions by militaries around the world, including the United States, often to illuminate targets as part of tracer munitions at night. White phosphorus is also used to create smokescreens during the day, as it puts off a huge amount of smoke when it burns. It can ignite fast-burning, fast-spreading fires on the ground, and once ignited, white phosphorus is extremely difficult to extinguish. The substance sticks to many surfaces, including skin and clothing. All of those properties make it extremely dangerous to civilians. White phosphorus can cause deep burns, all the way down to and even through bone, and can reignite after initial treatment. ""Incendiary weapons cause devastating burns, and in far worse ways than any of the standard scald or fire burns,"" Dr. Rola Hallam, a physician who treated incendiary weapons victims in Syria, said in a report by Human Rights Watch. ""They can burn through everything. If they can burn through metal, what hope does human flesh have?"" Because of its incendiary effects, the use of phosphorus in war is supposed to be tightly regulated under international law — but it is not banned. Phosphorus is not classed as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention. When used as a weapon, it can cause fire to rain down on targets, inflicting indiscriminate damage. It is illegal, therefore, for phosphorus to be used near civilians, because international law requires that combatants distinguish between civilian and military elements. There have been documented civilian casualties from the use of white phosphorus in war zones around the world, including Syria, Afghanistan, Gaza and elsewhere, according to Human Rights Watch.

2022-03-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-struck-resupply-ship/,U.S. confirms Ukraine struck Russian ship; Russian cruise missiles failing at rate of 20-60% in Ukraine,"A senior U.S. defense official briefed reporters on the Pentagon's latest assessments of Russia's war in Ukraine — here are some of the highlights: Russia is experiencing high cruise missile failure rates upon launch, ranging from ""20% to 60%"" a senior defense official said this week, citing U.S. assessments. In many cases, the official noted, the air-launched cruise missiles simply don't release from the rails of the plane that is trying to fire them. Russian planes are currently flying about 300 sorties a day. Further, Russian forces appear to be running lowest on air-launched cruise missiles and may be trying conserve those missiles, the official said. Though they still have about 50% of their stockpile remaining, the declining stocks of precision-guided missiles is a factor in the increasing use of dumb bombs. Russia's assault on Ukraine, now in its 30th day, has fired 1,260 missiles, according to the official. It appears that Russia, for the moment, is not pursuing a ground offense against Kyiv, though the capital continues to be hammered by missile and artillery fire. Russian troops are no longer moving toward Kyiv, and there has been no movement from the north or northwest. They are also being held to positions they had in the east and continuing to dig into defensive positions. U.S. defense officials assess that the Donbass region is now the Kremlin's top priority, but it's still too early to determine whether Russia has begun to limit its objectives, perhaps trying to split off that part of the country. As Russian combat power on the ground suffers declines — now assessed to be about 85 to 90% of what it was a month ago, with reduced numbers of troops, tanks, military vehicles and aircraft — the U.S. is seeing the first indications that Russian troops are moving in from Georgia. The Defense Department confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck the Russian military resupply ship Orsk while it was docked at the port of Berdyansk, in southern Ukraine. Just a couple days earlier, Russian state media had shown video of the military landing ship offloading armored vehicles and tanks at the port, which had been taken over by Russia. From the images available, officials believe that Ukraine destroyed the ship. The heaviest fighting continues to be taking place in Mariupol, Donbass, Mykolaiv and Chernihiv. Defense officials have seen reports Ukrainians are pushing the Russians out of Mykolaiv and Chernihiv, and there has been significant Ukrainian resistance in Kherson, which is no longer as solidly under Russian control as it was. There has been no confirmation of the Ukrainian claim that Russia has used phosphorus or thermobaric weapons.",7,3.576091640846675,4.600140331521043,-1.024048690674368,19

It was believed that around 1,300 civilians were using the theater as a bomb shelter to escape Russia's brutal, ongoing assault on the besieged city, according to Ukraine's human rights commissioner. The word for ""children"" had been written in huge letters on the ground outside both ends of the theater so that it could be seen from planes overhead. Russia denied striking the theater, repeating widely debunked claims that it has not targeted any civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and accusing Ukrainian ""nationalists"" of blowing the theater up as a provocation, without offering any evidence. The United Nations said Friday that it was receiving mounting evidence of mass graves in Mariupol, including one that appeared to be holding about 200 victims of the war. Ukrainian officials estimate there are still roughly 100,000 civilians trapped in the city, where Russia's siege cut off food, water, gas and electricity supplies weeks ago. Some 10 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes after just one month of war, with at least 3.5 million driven to seek safety in neighboring countries. More than half of them have crossed Ukraine's western border into Poland, where President Joe Biden was paying a visit on Friday in a show of solidarity both with the refugees, and those helping them. ""With every day of our defense, we are getting closer to the peace that we need so much,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Thursday evening address. ""We can't stop even for a minute, for every minute determines our fate, our future, whether we will live."" CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams visited a Ukrainian military base and saw some of those defenses — and a group of new Ukrainian recruits getting ready to join the fight. Lieutenant Miroslav Hai was a filmmaker and military reservist before Russia invaded his country, and said Ukrainians would continue defending their nation and their freedom no matter what, even if Putin uses nuclear weapons. ""Normal person don't want war. But we must,"" he said. ""Because if we don't stop [Russia] now, our children will begin fight with Russia… If we don't stop Putin in Ukraine, he will go more. If we don't stop Putin in Ukraine, he will go to other countries."" Officials told CBS News that recruits at the base receive only about a week of basic training before they are sent to the front lines. In the armory, they told Williams they were receiving weapons from NATO countries, but that they need more, as well as vehicles to move troops around. Hai said he felt hatred when he thought of what Russia was doing to Ukraine. ""I think that we have little bit similar situation with Soviet Union and Afghanistan,"" he told CBS News. ""Afghanistan destroyed Soviet Union, and I hope that Ukraine will destroy Russian empire."" On Friday, Russia's defense ministry said 1,351 of its troops had been killed in Ukraine since the ""special military operation"" began. The ministry said 3,825 more servicemembers had been injured, though NATO believes those numbers to be much higher, estimating that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in the war so far. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 1,300 Ukrainian service members had been killed defending the country from Russia's invasion. Analysts told the Washington Post that the true number of Ukrainian losses could be higher as well. In some key areas around the capital, Ukrainian forces have reportedly managed to push Russian troops back. A Russian supply ship was destroyed on Thursday at a port not far from Mariupol, and Ukrainians were pushing to take back a town near Kyiv that was claimed by the Russian invaders. But while Putin's ground forces have been largely bogged down for weeks, particularly around Kyiv, they have continued to push against Ukraine's defenders in the south and east. On Friday, officials said the northern city of Chernihiv — decimated after weeks of incessant shelling but still under Ukrainian control — had been completely cut off by Russian forces. ""The city has been conditionally, operationally surrounded by the enemy,"" the regional governor said on television, adding that Chernihiv was still under fire from warplanes and artillery.",47,3.399229650646001,3.948133520449044,-0.5489038698030431,23
2022-03-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/russia-hacking-threat-energy-sector/,U.S. announces charges against Russians in global hacking campaigns,"The Justice Department revealed Thursday that four Russian nationals working for the Russian government have been previously indicted for two separate incidents of attempted hacking into energy facilities in the U.S. and abroad between 2012 and 2018, targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in some 135 countries. Justice Department officials said in a press release that one of the campaigns, if successful, would have given Russia the ability to disrupt energy sector computer systems ""at a future time of its choosing,"" resulting in ""potentially catastrophic"" damage to critical infrastructure. A Justice Department official told reporters that these charges were unsealed because ""they do a good job of highlighting the kind of thing that we are concerned about in the current environment."" The official added, ""they're very good examples of the dark art of the possible."" The unsealing of the indictments follows President Biden's announcement Monday that ""evolving intelligence"" suggests Russia is exploring options for potential cyberattacks targeting the U.S. homeland. For weeks, the Biden administration has urged U.S. businesses, including energy companies, to monitor for signs of potential cyber attacks should the Kremlin lash out following the severe economic sanctions put in place against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. ""Russian state-sponsored hackers pose a serious and persistent threat to critical infrastructure both in the United States and around the world,"" Lisa Monaco, deputy attorney general, said in a statement Thursday. ""Although the criminal charges unsealed today reflect past activity, they make crystal clear the urgent ongoing need for American businesses to harden their defenses and remain vigilant."" The first incident involved the alleged hacking of a petrochemical refinery in Saudi Arabia in 2017, where an employee of Russia's state research center, Evgeny Gladkikh, allgedly deployed malware in an attempt to overtake the industrial control systems and operational technology, designed by Schneider Electric. Instead, the installed malware, known as ""Triton,"" prompted two automatic emergency shutdowns of operations, according to court documents. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned the Russian government research group for deploying Triton malware against U.S. partners in the Middle East, as well as scanning and probing U.S. facilities. The second operation, according to the Justice Department, allegedly involved a supply chain hack commonly referred to as ""Dragonfly"" or ""Havex and a ""spearphishing"" campaign by three FSB hackers. Pavel Akulov, Mikhail Gavrilov, and Marat Tyukov are accused of spending at least five years attempting to infiltrate organizations in the international energy sector, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants and utility and power transmission companies, the government said. If successful, the Justice Department said the mission could have disrupted critical energy services to hospitals, homes and businesses. ""The actor has been involved in repeated attempts to gain access to U.S. and European critical infrastructure across multiple sectors including utilities, manufacturing, airports and others. We are concerned that while there have been significant remediation efforts after each of the intrusion campaigns, the actor may retain some access,"" John Hultquist, VP of Intelligence Analysis at Mandiant told CBS News. Cybersecurity researched have observed this actor burrow into critical infrastructure. ""Our concern with recent events is that this might be the contingency we have been waiting for,"" Hultquist noted. Hackers did succeed in gaining access to computers at Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Plant in Burlington, Kansas, which operates a nuclear power plant. However, the hacked computers were not connected to the industrial control system itself. None of the four defendants is in custody, according to Justice Department officials. ""In these two cases, we've determined that the benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future,"" a Justice Department official told reporters. Russia has repeatedly denied engaging in cyber attacks against the United States and its allies. CBS News has reached out to the Russian Embassy in Washington for comment. Following the announcement, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), FBI and Department of Energy released a technical bulletin detailing the global intrusion campaigns. ""While this advisory documents historical cyber activity, CISA, FBI and DOE assess that state-sponsored Russian cyber operations continue to pose an ongoing threat to U.S. Energy Sector networks,"" the agencies said in a joint statement. ""The U.S. energy sector and critical infrastructure organizations more broadly are urged to apply the recommended mitigations."" The U.S. government has recommended critical infrastructure owners and operators deploy robust network segmentation between information technology and industrial control system networks, enforce multi-factor authentication and limit permissions associated with privileged accounts.",20,6.3434640961160245,5.2436446787156115,1.099819417400413,16
2022-03-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-russian-landing-ship-destroyed-berdyansk-putin-deaths-nato/,"Ukraine claims to destroy Russian military ship as NATO says Russia may have lost 15,000 troops in just a month of war","Zhytomyr, Ukraine — Ukrainians have suffered immensely in Vladimir Putin's war on their country, but it appears the conflict is not going well for Russia's forces. By some estimates, Russia has already lost as many troops in 28 days as it did during ten years of war in Afghanistan during the 1980s. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams and her team were in Ukraine a month ago when Russia launched its first strikes, but instead of the lightning invasion that Putin may have anticipated, she said his ground forces appear stalled. Ukraine claims it has killed six Russian generals, and on Thursday the country's military said it had destroyed at least one Russian naval ship in an occupied port town on the south coast. Just a couple days after Russian state media showed video of the military landing ship Orsk offloading armored vehicles and tanks at the port of Berdyansk, in southern Ukraine, Kyiv's navy said Wednesday that it had destroyed the ship. Unverified video and photos posted online showed thick black smoke rising from the dockside. Russia said earlier in the week that it had a total of 10 ships ready to dock along Ukraine's southern coast, carrying dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers and other equipment to bolster its push to capture other vital port cities in the region. Putin's forces are hammering southern Ukraine with air and artillery strikes, trying to seize a swath of ground across to create a land corridor between the occupied Crimean Peninsula and Russian territory, but cities like the besieged port of Mariupol stand in the way, and Ukraine's forces have refused to give up the fight to hold onto them. Given the significant losses Russia is suffering — even if Putin's regime isn't telling the Russian people about them — there have been many rumors of his senior advisors coming under intense pressure. On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked about the ""disappearance"" of Russia's normally frequently seen Minister of Defense, Sergei Shoigu, who hadn't been seen or heard from publicly in days. ""Well, the Minister of Defense now has a lot of worries, as you understand,"" Peskov told reporters. ""Now is not quite the time for media activity. This is quite understandable."" Soon after, the Russian government released a short video clip showing Putin holding a meeting — via video conference call — with his national security team, and Shoigu was visible on the screen in Putin's office. The defense chief wasn't heard to say anything in the short clip, but the Kremlin said he had ""reported progress in the special military operation and efforts being made by the military to provide humanitarian aid, ensure security, and restore vital infrastructure on the liberated territories."" The human cost of Russia's invasion — not only for Ukraine, but for Putin's own military — has been horrifying. If the Russian leader thought he'd score an easy victory in Ukraine, Williams said he undoubtedly knows better now. In just one month, between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, according to an estimate by a NATO official. Ukraine's forces are still outgunned, but in some places, particularly on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv, they're clawing back territory from the invaders. But as Williams reports, it is Ukrainian civilians paying the highest price for Putin's brutal invasion. The besieged city of Mariupol has been laid to waste, and with more than 100,000 civilians still thought to be trapped inside, Russia continues pummeling them from the air. Masha, 15, made it out of Mariupol, but her right leg had to be amputated after it was torn apart by a Russian strike. Her doctor said she was so traumatized that she couldn't eat for days. In a video message Wednesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of trying to wipe his people off the face of the Earth. ""It breaks my heart, heart of all Ukrainians, and every free person on the planet,"" he said, calling on the U.S. and its NATO partners to provide more weapons to help his country repel the Russian invasion. Zelenskyy warned that if Ukraine isn't given what it needs to stop Putin, the Russian leader could take his fight beyond Ukrainian soil. ""This is only the beginning for Russia on the Ukrainian land,"" he said. ""Russia is trying to defeat the freedom of all people in Europe, of all people in the world."" In an address to NATO leaders gathered in Brussels, including President Joe Biden, Zelenskyy said Russian forces were using weapons banned under international law for the devastation they cause. ""Phosphorus bombs were used. Russian phosphorus bombs,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to banned type of incendiary munitions. ""Adults were killed again, and children were killed again."" In the town of Zhotymyr, west of Kyiv, Williams and her team met Serhei as he sifted through the wreckage of the home he spent 12 years building it for his family. He said Russian airstrikes destroyed it earlier this month, killing four people in his neighborhood. One of those killed was Serhei's daughter Katya, who left behind a one-year-old daughter. ""I wish I died in her place,"" Serhei told CBS News. ""The pain doesn't go away."" ""Of course, I blame Putin,"" he said. ""If I had him in my hands I would butcher him like a goat."" Serhei told Williams that he would raise his granddaughter and, like other Ukrainians, he's determined to rebuild his country.",47,3.7291559347524394,4.336167187733354,-0.6070112529809144,21

Eric Vollbrecht, a cybersecurity engineer with Success Computer Consulting in Golden Valley, says longer pass-phrases are more effective than simple passwords. He also advises against using the same one across many accounts. Being hacked can mean access to bank accounts and social networks. ""It is an invasion of your privacy,"" Vollbrecht said. ""You lose the sense of control over the data of your life."" Vollbrecht says hackers typically go after low-hanging fruit, like simple passwords, as an entry point into your life. ""The more devices that you have connected to the internet, the more chance for bad guys to exploit that device and connect to it,"" he said. Be cautious with urgent requests asking you to do something unusual, like transfer money or give a credit card number. Working from home can also create vulnerability. ""[Employees are] working from a network that's not as secure, and we talk about that often with clients that are coming in about protecting their devices,"" Vollbrecht said. ""A lot of people don't realize how valuable their information is to hackers."" He says if you're not planning any major purchases, you might want to consider freezing your credit.

2022-03-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-latest-developments-month-into-vladimir-putin-invasion/,Russia's war in Ukraine: Latest developments and what you need to know almost a month into Putin's invasion,"It has been almost one month since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade Ukraine on February 24. He had a huge military advantage from the outset, but despite the odds and an incessant and brutal aerial bombardment of his neighbors, the facts on the ground do not reflect Putin's continuing insistence that what he stubbornly refuses to call a war is going to plan. Below are some of the latest developments, both on the front lines and as the United States and its allies continue trying to show a united front against Putin's aggression, and in support of Ukraine's government. Ukrainian military officials say they have pushed Russian forces out of Makariv, a strategically important suburb on the western approach to Kyiv, preventing the Russians from surrounding Ukraine's capital city from the north-west. A U.S. senior defense official said Tuesday that Ukrainian forces have also launched offensives in other areas, reclaiming territory around the decimated northeastern city of Kharkiv, and in the country's south. ""It's notable,"" the official said. ""Not only are the Ukrainians defending well, they're making efforts to take back territory the Russians have taken in recent days."" The official said Russia's military may have lost around 10% of the troops it originally sent to Ukraine, and that it was suffering ""command and control issues."" The official also said some Russian ""soldiers are suffering from frostbite because they lack the appropriate cold weather gear. We don't think they properly planned."" In a U.K. intelligence update, the British defense ministry said the battlefield across the north of the country appeared ""static,"" but it warned that Russia could be trying to reorganize its ground forces to stage an assault on Kyiv. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has warned that with Putin's back ""against the wall,"" there has been a ""clear sign"" that the Russian leader is considering unleashing chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine. Russia's brutal siege of the port city of Mariupol continues. Over 80% of homes have reportedly been damaged, and thousands of civilians remain trapped without food or water. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had blocked a humanitarian convoy on Tuesday — despite the route being agreed to ahead of time — that was entering the city to deliver desperately needed supplies. Four of the aid workers and 11 drivers were taken captive, another official said. ""We are trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents, but almost all of our attempts, unfortunately, are foiled by the Russian occupiers, by shelling, or deliberate terror,"" Zelenskyy said in a video Tuesday evening. More than 100,000 civilians remain in Mariupol, ""in inhuman conditions, under a full blockade, without food, without water, without medicine and under constant shelling, under constant bombardment,"" Zelenskyy said. A Russian official told the country's state-run news agency RIA Novosti that Russia's interest in seizing Mariupol was to build a land bridge between the occupied Crimean Peninsula and the eastern separatist republics of Donestk and Luhansk. ""Taking control of the highway from Crimea to Mariupol... will reliably connect the peninsula with the Donbas by a transport corridor,"" said Kirill Stepanov, a government adviser for Russia's Southern Federal District. U.S. President Joe Biden was traveling to Brussels this week for a series of meetings with allies. In a show of unity, Mr. Biden will sit down separately with fellow leaders from NATO, the Group of Seven (G-7) nations, and the European Union. The U.S. president is expected to announce a new round of sanctions against members of Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma. The sanctions will target 400 individuals, including 328 Russian lawmakers, the Wall Street Journal reported. Last month, the Duma passed an appeal to Russian president Vladimir Putin to recognize the independence of the eastern breakaway regions of Ukraine, a move which foreshadowed Russia's invasion of the country. There have been a handful of rounds of direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian government delegations. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the negotiations were moving forward ""step by step."" He noted that they were ""very difficult, sometimes confrontational."" The Ukrainian leader said everything was on the table in the talks, but that any agreement that might be reached would have to be put to a referendum in his country. On Monday, he called for direct talks with Putin. Poland has suggested that NATO could deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine, but the Kremlin quickly warned against any such move and Washington and some EU countries have been extremely wary of taking any actions that could be used by Putin to further escalate the war. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that sending NATO troops into Ukraine would be a ""very reckless and extremely dangerous decision"" with possible ""difficult-to-repair consequences."" Zelenskyy has said that he expects to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon. China, a Russian ally, has remained muted about the conflict. U.S. officials have said that Putin asked China for assistance on the battlefield.",47,4.378539393139531,3.7926624317532065,0.5858769613863242,26
2022-03-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stolen-cryptocurrency-oligarchs-assets-financial-crime-irs/,Billions in stolen crypto. Oligarchs' illicit assets. Financial crime is more complex than ever — and investigators say they need help to keep up,"In its more than 100-year history, the IRS criminal investigation unit has helped put away the likes of Al Capone and John Gotti. It is the nation's sixth-largest federal law enforcement agency and the only one authorized to investigate federal criminal tax violations and pursue related financial crimes, such as money laundering, currency violations and terrorist financing. But as the financial world grows more complex, so has criminal activity – and the unit tasked with bringing such illicit action to heel is facing an increasing challenge. About 75% of the unit's time is spent on tax investigations, but in recent years, they've shifted resources to emerging areas – like cryptocurrency. ""Gone are the simple days of a person sending a transaction through a single bank account. That was easy to uncover: gain records from the bank. Now it's a very complicated web of sophisticated criminals trying to move money globally,"" said Jarod Koopman from the IRS criminal investigation unit. Last fiscal year, the criminal investigation unit identified $3.5 billion in stolen crypto. This year, they've already exceeded that amount. And the crypto team, once 10 people, is now 70. But that's not because of an expanded workforce. Instead, IRS officials said, the agency has pulled resources away from other priorities. As the United States and allies slapped sanctions on Russian banks, officials, businesses, oligarchs and their families in an effort to inflict financial pain on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, the Internal Revenue Service is also at the forefront of making sure the wealthiest Russians helping fuel Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine are not evading restrictions. In early March, the Justice Department launched the Kleptocapture Task Force to enforce sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the United States against Russia. The IRS criminal investigation unit is part of that interagency effort to find and seize yachts, houses, luxury vehicles and more. But their work began long before the recent invasion. Since 2017, the IRS has been involved in similar sanctions evasion work, with roughly 20 investigations directly related to money laundering by oligarchs. Criminal investigation unit cyber agents have also been working on efforts involving cryptocurrency transactions associated with Russian-based entities for the past several months. Some of the ways targets have tried to evade sanctions and continue living their lavish lifestyles include using other names, establishing fictitious businesses and using new platforms like digital assets and cryptocurrency to shift funds, IRS officials said. IRS investigators look at both traditional and nontraditional financial transactions as individuals try and move billions of dollars globally, which compliments the task force's work. ""Our job has been really to take a look at the financial transactions and those flows that occur to understand and unravel the web that those criminals are trying to mask,"" said Koopman. As part of the supplemental package for support for Ukraine, the Treasury Department requested Congress include $30 million for the criminal investigation unit to help with some of its work focused on sanction evasion by Russian oligarchs. The IRS uses a database that tracks public records across the world to help learn how different people are holding assets. The unit has five subscriptions to the service; the additional funding would expand that to 60 subscriptions allowing more people to access the information, IRS officials said. That funding request was denied. Officials warn that without more resources, not only are they unable to stop illegal activity, they are unable to serve as a deterrent – which could lead to an increase in illegal activity just as the use of crypto and other digital assets are on the rise. In just over a decade, the unit has lost approximately 25% of its employees. Today, it has fewer than 3,000 employees, even as the industry grows more complex. The Treasury Department has called for the unit to grow by more than 40% over the next five years to meet its increasing needs, from carrying out investigations to scoping out emerging areas. ""When you think of the deterrence effects of having a meaningful CI presence that's able to investigate some of these really sophisticated financial criminals, this is clearly an area of substantial need,"" said Natasha Sarin at the Treasury Department. The depleted criminal investigation unit is part of a broader lack of resources and staffing at the IRS. The agency overall has seen its budget drop by 20% over the past ten years. Efforts to increase funding for the agency have been met with fierce political resistance. There has been some progress for the Biden administration: The omnibus spending package passed earlier this month included the largest increase of the agency's budget in two decades – a 10% raise. But a push for another $80 billion for the agency has hit a wall. The criminal investigations unit identified $10.4 billion from tax fraud and financial crimes last year. The Treasury Department said it likely deterred the equivalent amount of such behavior, all with a budget of just $600 million. IRS officials said they've been able to adjust by using technology to their advantage to become more efficient, but with more criminals – it means a need for more resources. As IRS officials put it: It's a cat and mouse game.",20,6.320740678685128,5.020962052863564,1.2997786258215642,6

The secretary of state's statement comes one day after the Defense Department said it had ""seen clear evidence that over the last week or so the Russians have deliberately and intentionally targeted civilian infrastructure."" Blinken and President Biden are headed Wednesday to Brussels for a NATO summit on Ukraine. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Zelenskyy will address world leaders gathering in Brussels Thursday for an extraordinary meeting of the alliance. On Friday, they will head to Warsaw, Poland, to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Mr. Biden last week called Putin a ""war criminal"" for launching the attack in Ukraine.

2022-03-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pennsylvania-police-body-armor-ukraine/,Pennsylvania Police Agencies Sending Body Armor To Ukraine,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The Pennsylvania State Police and the state Capitol Police are donating used body armor to efforts in Ukraine to deliver humanitarian aid amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, state officials said Wednesday. Col. Robert Evanchick, the state police commissioner, said the ballistic vests and helmets are intended for Ukrainian police officers and aid workers in Ukraine, and are to be shipped by the California Army National Guard, as long as the federal government approves. The two agencies produced about 110 used police bulletproof vests and 15 surplus ballistic helmets that they were no longer using. ""This is surplus equipment that would be thrown away otherwise,"" Gov. Tom Wolf said at a news conference at state police headquarters. Wolf noted that states cannot send weapons to a foreign country, but said the Ukrainian consulate has asked for food and masks for protection from the coronavirus, so his administration is working on those requests. Wolf also has asked the Legislature to approve $2 million ​in state aid to provide help for Ukrainians fleeing the invasion​ who may come to Pennsylvania. Wolf said Wednesday that he has no information about Ukrainian refugees arriving in the state. (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

2022-03-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-cyberattacks-us-energy-fbi-warning/,"Russia exploring options for potential cyberattacks on U.S. energy sector, FBI warns","The FBI has warned the U.S. energy sector about ""network scanning activity"" stemming from multiple Russia-based IP addresses. The activity is believed to be associated with cyber actors ""who previously conducted destructive cyber activity against foreign critical infrastructure."" The FBI bulletin, issued March 18 and obtained by CBS News, was released just days before President Biden announced Monday that ""evolving intelligence"" suggests Russia is exploring options for potential cyberattacks targeting the U.S. homeland. Federal law enforcement revealed that activity of Russian IP addresses ""likely indicates early stages of reconnaissance, scanning networks for vulnerabilities for use in potential future intrusions."" The FBI has identified 140 overlapping IP addresses linked to ""abnormal scanning"" activity of at least five U.S. energy companies, as well as at least 18 other U.S. companies spanning the defense industrial base, financial services, and information technology. However, the focus appears to be on entities within the energy sector, according to the FBI assessment. ""US Energy Sector entities are advised to examine current network traffic for these IP addresses and conduct follow-on investigations if observed,"" the alert reads. According to the FBI, IP addresses identified by law enforcement began scanning U.S. critical infrastructure as early as March 2021. ""This scanning activity has increased since the start of the Russia/Ukraine conflict, leading to a greater possibility of future intrusions,"" the bulletin notes. ""While the FBI recognizes that scanning activity is common on a network, these reported IPs have been previously identified as conducting activity in conjunction with active exploitation of a foreign victim, which resulted in destruction of the victim's systems."" The bureau says that while these IPs cannot be directly correlated to successful exploitation, the FBI is providing indicators of compromise ""out of an abundance of caution."" FBI Director Christopher Wray said Tuesday that concern about malicious cyber activity is the product of ""specific investigative work and surveillance work that we've been doing all together."" He added, ""Most cyberattacks don't just happen in an instant. There's activity that leads up to it. There's scanning and researching, researching of victims. Scanning for vulnerabilities in systems. There's developing access to those systems. There's a whole range of preparatory work, which is what we've been seeing."" According to the FBI, the number of ransomware incidents reported to the U.S. government increased by 82% from 2019 to 2021. Since the bureau opened its investigation into Russia-based REvil hackers in August 2018, cybercriminals have attacked more than 40,000 U.S.-based victims and received over $150 million in ransoms through virtual currency systems. But some U.S. cybersecurity firms have alleged discrepancies in the FBI memo, noting that many of the IP addresses listed do not exhibit targeted behavior, while others are not geo-located in Russia. ""Some have scanned internet hosts which have no connection to critical infrastructure,"" Sergio Caltagirone, a former NSA cyber-defense expert and director of threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Dragos, told CBS News. ""Therefore, the targeted premise which supposedly underpins this list is questionable."" Caltagirone added that cybersecurity firms have ""precious few network defense resources"" to draw upon to protect industrial infrastructure. ""Tasking them with tracking 140 scanning IP addresses with no additional context will take them away from doing more valuable network defense activities,"" he said. Anne Neuberger, Mr. Biden's deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters Monday that U.S. officials have observed ""preparatory work"" linked to nation-state actors. Such activity could indicate increased levels of scanning websites and hunting for vulnerabilities among U.S. companies. Since February 15, the Ukrainian government said it has suffered over 3,000 DDoS or ""distributed denial of service attacks,"" that have barraged government websites with traffic, rendering them unusable. But cyber attacks launched by Russia since the start of the Ukrainian invasion have created relatively minimal damage compared with the shelling of cities and civilian casualties brought about by kinetic warfare. Last week, engineers linked Ukraine to an electricity grid connected to much of continental Europe, allowing the country to remove its power system from its Russian adversary, officials announced. A pair of Russian-linked cyber attacks in 2015 and 2016 knocked power out in parts of Ukraine. U.S. lawmakers and cybersecurity experts have long warned of the Kremlin using its Ukrainian neighbor as a ""testing ground"" for powerful cyber weapons. The urgent memo to private sector owners and operators comes just days before the president is set to travel to Brussels Thursday for a NATO summit before heading to Poland. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential,"" Mr. Biden said Monday, addressing the Business Roundtable, an association of some of the nation's largest corporations. ""And it's coming."" The FBI does not comment on specific intelligence products as standard practice, a spokesperson noted. ""The FBI routinely shares information with law enforcement and industry partners in order to protect the communities they serve and work with. The FBI always encourages members of the public and private industry to be vigilant and report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement,"" the spokesperson added. The Department of Energy told CBS News in a statement that it ""remains fully engaged with our industry and government partners."" ""We continue to hold regular threat briefings, share intelligence and actionable information with our energy sector partners, and encourage them to strengthen their cybersecurity posture and remain vigilant,"" the Department of Energy Spokesperson said.

2022-03-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-cyber-attack-threat-biden-warning/,"President Biden warns of ""evolving"" Russian cyber threat to U.S.: ""It's coming""","President Biden warned Monday that ""evolving intelligence"" suggests Russia is exploring options for potential cyberattacks targeting U.S. critical infrastructure. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential,"" Mr. Biden said, addressing the Business Roundtable, an association of some of the nation's largest corporations. ""And it's coming."" While there's no evidence of any specific cyberattack threat, Anne Neuberger, Mr. Biden's deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters Monday afternoon that U.S. officials have observed ""preparatory work"" linked to nation-state actors. Such activity could indicate increased levels of scanning websites and hunting for vulnerabilities among U.S. companies. Further details on U.S. intelligence remain unclear, but as Moscow could look for ways to retaliate against economic sanctions imposed following their invasion of Ukraine, potential targets include the U.S. financial sector, electric grid, water treatment plants and hospitals. ""Russia is probably looking to aggressively respond in a manner that won't lead to war with the U.S., and cyber attacks are a means for them to exact costs without crossing a major red line,"" John Hultquist, vice president of intelligence analysis for cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told CBS News. ""Cyber attacks are often reversible and nonlethal, but their economic and psychological costs could be significant."" Neuberger called it ""deeply troubling"" that companies worldwide continue to see breaches as a result of known vulnerabilities they've failed to patch. The White House push comes just days before the president is set to embark on a trip to Brussels for a NATO summit on Thursday before heading to Poland and amid the U.S. government's efforts to declassify intelligence about Russia's plans in Ukraine. The U.S. has previously disclosed its findings to deter the Kremlin and other adversaries from following through on plans and undermine attempts at plausible deniability. White House officials delivered classified briefings to more than 100 companies last week, urging at-risk private sector partners to bolster cybersecurity defenses against potential intrusions by Russia-linked actors. ""Most of America's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and critical infrastructure owners and operators must accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors,"" Monday's White House statement said. ""The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has been actively working with organizations across critical infrastructure to rapidly share information and mitigation guidance to help protect their systems and networks."" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday encouraged organizations ""of every size and across every sector"" to report cyber incidents to CISA or their local FBI field office. ""DHS will continue to share timely and actionable information and intelligence to ensure our partners and the public have the tools they need to keep our communities safe and secure, and increase nationwide cybersecurity preparedness,"" Mayorkas added. For months, the Biden administration has prodded companies to prevent cyber intrusions through a slew of tactics: multi-factor authentication, patching known vulnerabilities, running through drills and emergency plans, as well as encrypting and backing up data. CISA Director Jen Easterly told CBS News Friday that U.S. officials have not let their guard down. ""What we are focused on right now very urgently, is working very closely with our private sector partners with our state and local partners with our federal partners to ensure that there is a robust understanding of the cyber threat environment and the potential consequences of Russian malicious cyber activity."" ""It is increasingly difficult to prevent bad things from happening,"" Easterly added. ""And so we have to work together and assume that bad things will happen, assume there will be cyber attacks, assume there will be disruptive activity."" Easterly, the director of the nation's cyber defense agency, said she is increasingly worried about ""vigilance fatigue"" among U.S. companies sprinting to secure their networks. ""It is hard to maintain a very high tempo of extreme preparedness, but we are not even a month into this unjust, illegal, unprovoked invasion of a democracy and we need to continue to keep our shields up. We are putting out more and more information so that folks understand the nature of the threat environment."" Since November, the Department of Homeland Security has overseen more than 80 briefings, table exercises and informational sessions with the private sector designed to bolster U.S. cyber defenses in the event of Russian malicious cyber activity. Lawmakers have voiced their concerns directly to the DHS secretary. Last week, 22 U.S. senators, led by Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, signed a bipartisan letter demanding more information about the U.S. response to Russian cyber threats and disinformation. CISA vowed in a response letter on Monday to brief lawmakers in the coming days. CISA and the FBI released several joint cyber bulletins last week, including an advisory detailing the threat to satellite communication networks just days after reports of a hack by unidentified actors directed at telecommunications firm Viasat. Reuters first reported on the disruption of broadband satellite internet access at the start of the Russian invasion. Since February 15, the Ukrainian government said it has suffered over 3,000 DDoS or ""distributed denial of service attacks,"" that have barraged government websites with traffic until they grind to a halt. But a cyberattack on a NATO member state could prompt Article 5, its collective defense clause, according to previous statements by Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General. The hypothetical trigger has intensified concerns that the Russian invasion of Ukraine could spill over to the United States and other territories. ""An attack on critical infrastructure that can be tied to the Russian government would absolutely be grounds for escalation, depending on the impact of that incident,"" Alex Iftimie, a former national security official at the Department of Justice, told CBS News. ""It could have significant consequences down the road in terms of potential direct involvement of the United States in this conflict."" ""I think the president was very clear,"" Neuberger told reporters before departing from the briefing room. ""We're not looking for a conflict with Russia. But if Russia initiates a cyber attack against the United States, we will respond.""

2022-03-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-mariupol-biden-putin-chemical-biological-weapons/,"Biden says ""clear sign"" Putin considering use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine","Lviv — Russia continued flattening Ukraine's besieged port city of Mariupol on Tuesday amid escalating warnings from Washington that a cornered President Vladimir Putin, frustrated by his military's slow progress 26 days into the invasion of Ukraine, could resort to unleashing chemical or biological weapons on his neighbors. President Joe Biden said Monday that Putin's ""back is against the wall,"" with his assault on Ukraine not going to plan. Mr. Biden called the Russian leader's allegations that the U.S. has labs in Ukraine to develop chemical and biological weapons a ""clear sign he's considering using both"" himself. As U.S.-Russian relations plummet to new lows, the U.S. leader also warned businesses that a Russian cyberattack could soon target companies or infrastructure on American soil. Moscow has shown no sign of backing down in the standoff. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov issued a demand on Russian television Monday evening for ""an end to the demonization of Russia."" ""We insist that the responsibility for the possible consequences of what is happening lies entirely with Washington,"" Ryabkov warned. But while the Putin regime insists it's only targeting ""neo-Nazis"" and criminals in Ukraine, and that it never takes aim at civilian infrastructure, those claims are belied by the utter devastation of entire cities like Mariupol, which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says is being methodically ""reduced to ashes"" for refusing to accept Russian rule. Until just a month ago, it was a thriving port city home to about half a million people. It has been under constant Russian siege for weeks. Thousands of civilians are still trapped there, cowering in basements from the constant artillery barrage. Putin's forces have cut off everything from food and medicine to heat and electricity to the city. But some civilians have made it out. CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab met one family that escaped the devastation to reach the western city of Lviv. They told CBS News all that's left of Mariupol is ""hell on Earth."" Video shows black smoke rising from the remains of apartment buildings across the city, revealing the hell-scape left behind by Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine. The relentless shelling of Mariupol has triggered a mass exodus, and many, like the Vodizanska family, have escaped with little more than their lives. Bloodied and bruised, the once typical middle-class family fled their home in Mariupol and made it to the safety of a church in Lviv. Svetlana and Roman spent five days on the road with their children to escape Russia's relentless bombing of their city. ""Hell is when you don't know if you will be able to take the next breath, if you will [find] anything to feed your children with, because they are hungry,"" Svetlana told Tyab. ""Hell is when you know that if your child gets sick, he will die. ""That is hell,"" the mother told CBS News. ""That is hell here in the 21st century."" Nearly 90% of Mariupol's buildings, including civilian homes, have been damaged or destroyed. Workday traffic has given way to tank battles in the streets and armed soldiers patrolling what's left of neighborhoods. Svetlana injured her head in a car accident as she and her family rushed to escape the Russian strikes that have completely destroyed their home. Asked how she explains the war to her young children, Svetlana told CBS News that ""they will know the truth. The truth the way it is… they will be told the Russians wanted to kill us, but we persevered because we are strong."" ""We are Ukrainians,"" she said. ""It's in our blood."" Svetlana and her family remain defiant. They told CBS News they would like to get to the U.S., to try to rebuild their lives, but that Mariupol will always be home, and they'll return there one day to help rebuild their city, too.",47,6.194062225673108,1.6579488262295683,4.53611339944354,21

""I want to cry, because we had a connection between Ukraine and Russia,"" doctor Anatoli Pavlov said. ""Russian cruelty is so brutal."" The U.S. has evidence that Russia is deliberately and intentionally targeting civilians, including hospitals and places of shelter, a senior Defense Department official told CBS News. The U.S. said it has seen clear evidence the Russians are committing war crimes as civilians are killed in their homes and on the street. Yet Russia's ground forces have made surprisingly slow progress. Ukraine's military said it recaptured the strategically important town of Makariv just outside the capital Kyiv on Monday. They're now fighting to wrest back control of the cities of Izyum and Kherson, according to a senior U.S. Defense official. The Ukrainians are massively outgunned, but with anti-tank missiles supplied by the U.S. and its allies, they've destroyed hundreds of Russian armored vehicles and killed up to 9,000 Russian soldiers, a U.S. official said. Across Ukraine, ordinary people have mobilized to defend their towns and villages. A video filmed by a shopkeeper shows him helping to ambush Russian tanks. At a checkpoint, CBS News met Anatoli, a pig farmer who was armed with his own hunting rifle. He said the biggest thing he ever shot before was a goat. Now he and other volunteers from his village are taking shifts keeping watch over the main road into town, with a collection of Molotov cocktails and a homemade spike strip. President Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""back is against the wall"" and Ukraine's resistance and Russia's slow progress are raising concerns that he may use chemical or biological weapons to regain the upper hand in war. Russia has continued to crackdown on dissent at home, reportedly detaining around 15,000 people for protesting the invasion since the war started.",7,5.388971432876681,3.3283484000405488,2.060623032836132,21
2022-03-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/ukraine-mariupol-russia-surrender-reject/,Ukraine rejects Russian demand to surrender Mariupol in exchange for safe passage,"As it continued its barrage of the besieged city of Mariupol, Russia demanded that Ukrainians put down their arms and raise white flags on Monday in exchange for safe passage out of town. Ukraine angrily rejected the offer, which came hours after officials said Russian forces had bombed an art school in the port city that was sheltering some 400 people. While the fight for control of the strategically important city remained intense, Western governments and analysts see the broader conflict shifting definitively to a war of attrition. Russian Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said his forces would allow two corridors out of Mariupol, heading either east toward Russia or west to other parts of Ukraine. Mariupol residents were given until 5 a.m. Monday to respond to the offer. Russia didn't say what action it would take if it was rejected. ""There can be no talk of any surrender, laying down of arms,"" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk told the news outlet Ukrainian Pravda, rejecting the ultimatum from Russia. ""We have already informed the Russian side about this."" Mariupol Mayor Piotr Andryushchenko also rejected the offer, saying in a Facebook post that he didn't need to wait until morning to respond and cursing at the Russians, according to the news agency Interfax Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defense said authorities in Mariupol could face a military tribunal if they sided with what it described as ""bandits,"" Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Previous bids to allow residents to evacuate Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities have failed or have been only partially successful, with bombardments continuing as civilians sought to flee. Speaking in a video address early Monday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said about 400 civilians were taking shelter at the art school when it was struck by a Russian bomb. ""They are under the rubble, and we don't know how many of them have survived,"" he said. ""But we know that we will certainly shoot down the pilot who dropped that bomb, like about 100 other such mass murderers whom we already have downed."" Tearful evacuees from the devastated Azov Sea port city have described how ""battles took place over every street."" The fall of Mariupol would allow Russian forces in southern and eastern Ukraine to link up. But Western military analysts say that even if the surrounded city is taken, the troops battling a block at a time for control there may be too depleted to help secure Russian breakthroughs on other fronts. Roman and Svetlana Vodizanska, once a typical middle class family, were bloodied and bruised after traveling with their children for five days to Lviv to escape Mariupol, which Svetlana called hell on Earth. ""Hell is when you don't know if you will be able to take your next breath,"" she told CBS News Imtiaz Tyab. ""Hell is when everything is burning. Not just the buildings, but when the ground is burning."" Svetlana injured her head in a car accident while fleeing Russian strikes, which have completely destroyed their home. She called on the U.S. and President Biden to give Ukraine weapons. ""Please give us weapons. Give our country even just a small chance to survive,"" she said. ""Please help us."" Three weeks into the invasion, Western governments and analysts see the conflict shifting to a war of attrition, with bogged down Russian forces launching long-range missiles at cities and military bases as Ukrainian forces carry out hit-and-run attacks and seek to sever their supply lines. Moscow cannot hope to rule the country, Zelenskyy said Monday, given Ukrainians' enmity toward the Russian forces. The strike on the art school was the second time in less than a week that officials reported an attack on a public building where Mariupol residents had taken shelter. On Wednesday, a bomb hit a theater where more than 1,000 people were believed to be sheltering. Ukrainian officials have not given an update on the search of the theater since Friday, when they said at least 130 people had been rescued and another 1,300 were trapped by rubble. City officials and aid groups say food, water and electricity have run low in Mariupol and fighting has kept out humanitarian convoys. Communications are severed. The city has been under bombardment for over three weeks and has seen some of the worst horrors of the war. City officials said at least 2,300 people have died, with some buried in mass graves. Unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance has dashed Russian President Vladimir Putin's hopes for a quick victory after he ordered the Feb. 24 invasion of his neighbor. In recent days, Russian forces have entered Mariupol. But taking the city could prove costly. ""The block-by-block fighting in Mariupol itself is costing the Russian military time, initiative, and combat power,"" the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in a briefing. In a blunt assessment, the think tank concluded Russia failed in its initial campaign to take the capital of Kyiv and other major cities quickly. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Ukrainian resistance means Putin's ""forces on the ground are essentially stalled."" ""It's had the effect of him moving his forces into a woodchipper,"" Austin told CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. In Ukraine's major cities, hundreds of men, women and children have been killed in Russian attacks. Six more people were killed Sunday by shelling in the densely populated Podil district, not far from the center of capital Kyiv , according to AP journalists at the scene. The attack there devastated a shopping center, leaving a flattened ruin still smoldering Monday morning in the midst of high-rise towers. The force of the explosion shattered every window in the high-rise next door and twisted their metal frames. In the distance, the sound of artillery rang out as firefighters picked their way through the destruction. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Russian shelling hit several houses in Podil. Russian troops have been shelling Kyiv for a fourth week now and are trying to surround the capital, which had nearly 3 million people before the war. The U.N. has confirmed 902 civilian deaths in the war but concedes the actual toll is likely much higher. It says nearly 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine. Estimates of Russian deaths vary, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands. The Ukrainian prosecutor general's office says at least 115 children have been killed and 148 injured so far. Estimates of Russian deaths vary, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands. Some Russians also have fled their country amid a widespread crackdown on dissent. Russia has arrested thousands of antiwar protesters, muzzled independent media and cut access to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.",47,2.4593211415317997,3.1120709661807684,-0.6527498246489687,11
2022-03-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/myanmar-rohingya-genocide-blinken/,Blinken declares Myanmar's repression of Muslim Rohingya a genocide,"Violent repression of the largely Muslim Rohingya population in Myanmar amounts to genocide, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday, a declaration intended to both generate international pressure and lay the groundwork for potential legal action. Authorities made the determination based on confirmed accounts of mass atrocities on civilians by Myanmar's military in a widespread and systematic campaign against the ethnic minority, Blinken announced in a speech at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., Monday. Blinken said evidence showed the ""attack against Rohingya was widespread and systematic, which is crucial for reaching a determination of crimes against humanity."" ""The day will come when those responsible for these appalling acts will have to answer for them,"" Blinken said. The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, is already under multiple layers of U.S. sanctions since a military coup ousted the democratically elected government in February 2021. Thousands of civilians throughout the country have been killed and imprisoned as part of the ongoing repression of anyone opposed to the ruling junta. More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar to refugee camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, when the military launched an operation aimed at clearing them from the country following attacks by a rebel group. It is the eighth time since the Holocaust that the U.S. has concluded a genocide has occurred. ""It's a decision that I reached based on reviewing a factual assessment and legal analysis prepared by the State Department, which included detailed documentation by a range of independent, impartial sources, including human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as our own rigorous fact-finding,"" Blinken said. The secretary of state announced the U.S. would provide $1 million in new funding for the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, which continues to examine reports of atrocities. Following Blinken's announcement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the designation ""emphasizes, especially to victims and survivors, that the United States recognizes the gravity of these crimes."" ""Our view is that shining a light on the crimes of Burma's military will increase international pressure, make it harder for them to commit further abuses,"" she said. Blinken noted the importance of calling attention to inhumanity even as horrific attacks occur elsewhere in the world, including Ukraine, and made the crisis in Ukraine a central part of his speech. ""As we meet, the Russian government continues to wage its unprovoked, brutal war on Ukraine,"" Blinken said. ""Each day brings more harrowing attacks, more innocent men, women, and children killed. That includes the five people who were killed in a strike on March 1, on a TV tower and the surrounding area on the outskirts of Kyiv, the same site where, just over 80 years ago, 33,771 Jews were killed by the Nazis in just two days."" Blinken also pointed to atrocities elsewhere, including in Xinjiang where the Chinese government continues to commit genocide against Muslims and ethnic minorities. –CBS News' Camilla Shick contributed to this report",45,4.233849538696345,3.824556003763447,0.40929353493289744,8
2022-03-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-holocaust-survivor-boris-romantschenko-killed-kharkhiv/,96-year-old who endured four concentration camps during the Holocaust killed by Russian shelling in Ukraine,"Boris Romanchenko, a 96-year-old Holocaust survivor, was killed last Friday in Kharkiv, Ukraine, when Russian forces shelled the city, according to Ukraine's Defense Ministry. During World War II, Romanchenko survived the concentration camps at Buchenwald, Dora-Mittelbau, Peenemünde and Bergen-Belson, the memorials for the Buchenwald and Dora-Mittelbau camps said Monday. Romanechenko's granddaughter told the memorials that he was killed when the high-rise building he lived in was hit by Russian shelling. ""We are deeply saddened,"" the foundation said, while the Ukrainian Defense Ministry lamented that ""Putin managed to 'accomplish' what even Hitler couldn't."" Romanchenko was born on January 20, 1926 in Bondari, Ukraine, the memorial said in a statement. He was deported to Dortmund, Germany, in 1942 and was forced to do labor underground, the statement said. In 1943, after attempting to escape, Romanechenko was sent to Buchenwald, where over 50,000 people are estimated to have been killed. Those incarcerated at Buchenwald were often forced to perform slave labor for the German military. Romanchenko was one of those sent to Peenemünde, where he was forced to work on the development of the V-2 rocket. Buchenwald, which according to the foundation had grown to become Germany's largest concentration camp by the end of the war, was liberated by Ally forces in 1945. According to the memorials, Romanchenko had served as the vice president of the Buchenwald-Dora International Committee, and was devoted to documenting and preserving the Nazi crimes that he and millions of others endured. In 2015, Romanchenko participated in an event commemorating the 70th anniversary of liberation of Buchenwald, the camp's memorial foundation said, during which he read ""The Oath Of Buchenwald."" The oath, which was first read on April 19, 1945 at a memorial service dedicated to those who had been killed at the camp, ends with the promise to destroy ""Nazism, down to its roots"" and ""build a new world of peace and freedom."" Kharkiv, where Romanechenko was killed, is Ukraine's second largest city. Like many other civilian population centers, it has been under fire from Russian artillery throughout the invasion.

2022-03-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-chemical-biological-weapons-lloyd-austin-face-the-nation/,"Austin vows ""significant reaction"" if Russia uses chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine","Washington — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Sunday a chemical or biological weapons attack by Russia in Ukraine would prompt a ""significant reaction"" from the United States, as well as global allies and partners. ""If a chemical or biological weapon was used, you'd see a significant reaction from not only the United States, but also the global community,"" Austin said in an interview on ""Face the Nation."" ""I don't want to speculate about what exactly would change our calculation. I think engaging in hypotheticals is probably not helpful here either, but this is a very serious step and as you heard our president say, we won't take that lightly."" Twenty-five days after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces are struggling in their effort to take over the capital city of Kyiv but have continued their brutal bombardment of civilians. In the port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of bombing an art school where 400 people were sheltering, marking the second attack of a public building where civilians were taking shelter in less than a week. Russian forces struck a theater in Mariupol where more than 1,300 people were believed to be inside last week. Outside of other major cities, Russia's advance has largely stalled, though there has been growing concern among Ukrainian and U.S. officials that Moscow could use chemical or biological weapons in the ongoing war. The White House last week said Russia could escalate its attack by using such weapons or claiming Ukraine used chemical or biological weapons in a ""false flag"" attack as a pretext for more violence. Russian officials, meanwhile, have accused the U.S. of working on secret biological and chemical programs inside Ukraine, a claim the White House has rebuked as absurd and part of a ploy by Russia to try to justify its attack on Ukraine. Austin said that the U.S. has in the past seen Russia ""raising issues and creating a pretext so that if they did something in the battle space, they could blame it on somebody else, either Ukrainians, us, NATO."" ""This could possibly be what we're seeing today,"" he said. Austin said the U.S. expects to see Russia's attacks on civilians in Ukraine continue as a result of its stalled campaign and in an attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to re-establish momentum. ""They're not being effective today in terms of their maneuver forces on the ground. They're essentially stalled,"" he said. ""It's had the effect of [Putin] moving his forces into a wood chipper."" Austin commended the Ukrainian people for their defense of the country against Russia, saying they have shown ""significant resolve"" and been effective at using the weapons and equipment provided by the U.S. ""What we've seen in the past is that the Ukrainians have counterattacked, that they've used their initiative to move things around on the battlefield and they've presented some significant problems for the Russians,"" he said. The Biden administration has provided Ukraine with $2 billion in security assistance since 2021, and Congress earlier this month approved $13.6 billion in humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine and Eastern European allies. Still, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged the U.S. to help create a no-fly zone over his country's skies, a move President Biden has opposed due to concerns it would further escalate tensions with Russia. Austin, though, said the U.S. will work with allies and partners to help create conditions for Ukraine to get equipment like Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile systems and ""ensure they have the ability to protect their skies going forward.""",47,3.817385956478242,3.1804023016289227,0.6369836548493195,27
2022-03-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-tank-war/,Why Russia's tank war stalled in Ukraine,"The stalled and sputtering spectacle the Russian military is making of itself in Ukraine came as a revelation to General Frank McKenzie – and almost certainly to Vladimir Putin as well. ""I am surprised at the problems they were having,"" McKenzie said. ""It should be very concerning to Russian leadership."" As commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, McKenzie has spent the last three years operating in close proximity to the Russians in Syria, and knows their history as one of the world's great tank armies – all of which has been belied by the first three weeks of war. ""They haven't been able to maneuver their armor effectively,"" McKenzie told CBS News national security correspondent David Martin. ""There's a tremendous history of that, actually, in the Russian military, being able to do deep-armored operations. At the end of the Second World War, they were as good at that as anybody else. But these guys don't seem to have remembered that."" ""Should heads roll?"" Martin asked. ""I would not be happy if that's the way U.S. forces were performing,"" McKenzie replied. ""We have non-commissioned officers that are the backbone of the joint force. They're the people that actually make sure things are done, that continuing actions are taken, that you dig in, that your tanks don't run out of fuel."" McKenzie, himself a tank commander as a young officer, watched in disbelief as an entire armored column advancing on Kyiv literally ran out of gas. ""If you're going to drive and operate a main battle tank as a commander, and I have, then you are thinking all the time about fueling that beast. If you're not thinking about fueling that beast, then you're behind. And they appear to have not taken those basic logistical considerations and trying as they move forward."" Martin asked, ""Are you surprised they seem to be sticking to the roads?"" ""That's a lack of training,"" he said. ""You've got to get off the roads to maneuver. The roads are death traps, particularly for armored vehicles, particularly when you're fighting people that have good anti-tank systems, and the Ukrainians do have good anti-tank systems."" On Wednesday President Biden promised the U.S. will send 9,000 more anti-tank weapons. ""The United States and our allies and partners are fully committed to surging weapons of assistance to the Ukrainians,"" he said, ""and more will be coming."" Including the shoulder-fired Javelin, which dives down on the top of a tank where the armor is thinnest. Using everything from the high-end Javelin to the workaday rocket-propelled grenade launcher, the Ukrainians have destroyed several hundred Russian vehicles. Martin asked, ""How much of this is due to Russian incompetence as opposed to Ukrainian skill?"" ""That's a great question, and I think we're going to have to see how this progresses a little further to be able to finally answer that question. I would say this: the Ukrainians have shown great bravery in defending their country. It's less clear to me how aggressive and motivated Russian forces are down at the individual soldier level, the platoons that are actually driving on the roads, you know, meeting the enemy."" Ukrainian resistance foiled Russia's plan to take the capital of Kyiv with a lightning strike in the opening days of the war. With their vaunted tank army stalled, the Russians have reverted to siege tactics – pounding cities and their residents with rockets and artillery. But they are expected to regroup and try again. ""Is it conceivable to you that Russia could just flat-out fail to take Kyiv?"" asked Martin. ""I would be surprised if that outcome happened,"" McKenzie replied. ""Taking Kyiv is very important to them. I predict they'll try very hard to take it, and I think there could be a horrific price, actually, to be paid in the civilian population as they move against the city.""

2022-03-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ukraine-russia-bombed-art-school-mariupol/,Ukraine says Russians bombed art school sheltering 400 in besieged city of Mariupol,"Lviv, Ukraine — Ukrainian authorities said Sunday that Russia's military bombed an art school sheltering some 400 people in the embattled port city of Mariupol, where Ukraine's president said an unrelenting Russian siege would be remembered for centuries to come. It was the second time in less than a week that city officials reported a public building where residents had taken shelter coming under attack. A bomb hit a Mariupol theater with more than 1,300 believed to be inside on Wednesday, local officials said. There was no immediate word on casualties from the reported strike on the art school, which could not immediately be independently verified. Ukrainian officials have not given an update on the search of the theater since Friday, when they said at least 130 had been rescued. Mariupol, a strategic port on the Azov Sea, has been under bombardment for at least three weeks and has seen some of the worst horrors of the war in Ukraine. At least 2,300 people have died, some of whom had to be buried in mass graves, and food, water and electricity have run low. ""To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. ""The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences for it."" In recent days, Russian forces have battled their way into the city, cutting it off from the Azov Sea and devastating a massive steel plant. The fall of Mariupol would be an important but costly victory for the Russians, whose advance is largely stalled outside other major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europe since World War II. In major cities across Ukraine, hundreds of men, women and children have been killed in Russian bombardments, while millions of civilians have raced to underground shelters or fled the country. In the capital, Kyiv, at least 20 babies carried by Ukrainian surrogate mothers are stuck in a makeshift bomb shelter, waiting for parents to travel into the war zone to pick them up. The infants — some just days old — are being cared for by nurses who cannot leave the shelter because of constant shelling by Russian troops who are trying to encircle the city. In the hard-hit northeastern city of Sumy, authorities evacuated 71 orphaned babies through a humanitarian corridor, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said Sunday. He said the orphans, most of whom need constant medical attention, would be taken to an unspecified foreign country. Russian shelling killed at least five civilians, including a 9-year-old boy, in Kharkiv, an eastern city that is Ukraine's second-largest. The British Defense Ministry said Russia's failure to gain control of the skies over Ukraine ""has significantly blunted their operational progress,"" forcing them to rely on stand-off weapons launched from the relative safety of Russian airspace. The Russian Defense Ministry said a Kinzhal hypersonic missile hit a Ukrainian fuel depot in Kostiantynivka, a city near Mykolaiv. The Russian military said Saturday that it used a Kinzhal for the first time in combat to destroy an ammunition depot in the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine. Russia has said the Kinzhal, carried by MiG-31 fighter jets, has a range of up to about 1,250 miles and flies at 10 times the speed of sound. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Saturday that the U.S. couldn't confirm the use of a hypersonic missile in Ukraine. Konashenkov said Kalibr cruise missiles launched by Russian warships from the Caspian Sea were also involved in the strike on the fuel depot in Kostiantynivka and were used to destroy an armor repair plant in northern Ukraine. Unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance has dashed Russian President Vladimir Putin's hopes for a fast victory after he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine on February 24. While the Kremlin has said Russia is conducting a ""special military operation"" aimed at legitimate targets, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday that ""brutal, savage techniques"" targeting civilians had allowed Moscow's troops to advance. U.N. bodies have confirmed more than 847 civilian deaths since the war began, though they concede the actual toll is likely much higher. The U.N. says nearly 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine as refugees. Estimates of Russian deaths vary widely, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals — out of an estimated 20 deployed in Ukraine — suggest an impaired command of the fighting, said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia's security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. Russia would need 800,000 troops — almost equal to its entire active-duty military — to control Ukraine in the face of prolonged armed opposition, according to Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank. ""Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal — they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation — there will be just constant guerrilla war,"" Clarke said. Ukraine and Russia have held several rounds of negotiations aimed at ending the conflict, but the neighboring countries remain divided over several issues. Zelenskyy has said he is willing to drop Ukraine's bid to join NATO but wants certain security guarantees from Russia. Moscow is pressing for Ukraine's complete demilitarization. Evacuations from Mariupol and other besieged cities proceeded along eight of 10 humanitarian corridors that Ukraine and Russia agreed to on Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, and officials said a total of 6,623 people left Kyiv and other cities. Vereshchuk said planned humanitarian aid for the southern city of Kherson, which Russia seized early in the war, could not be delivered because the trucks were stopped along the way by Russian troops. Mariupol authorities said Sunday that nearly 40,000 people had left the city in the last week, the vast majority in their own vehicles, despite ongoing air and artillery strikes. Some Russians also have fled their country amid a widespread crackdown on dissent. Since the invasion of Ukraine started, police have arrested thousands of antiwar protesters, while government agencies have silenced independent media and cut off access to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. In Ukraine, Zelenskyy on Sunday ordered the activities of 11 political parties with links to Russia to be suspended during the period of martial law. The largest of those parties has 44 out of 450 seats in the country's parliament. ""Activities by politicians aimed at discord and collaboration will not succeed,"" he said in the address.",47,3.7881147345058395,1.9005271495275382,1.8875875849783013,11

As Russian forces target the outskirts of the western city of Lviv, Zelenskyy is accusing Russia of creating a humanitarian catastrophe by blocking critical supplies to his country's largest cities. The United Nations estimates 6.5 million people have been displaced by the war, coupled with more than 3 million who have fled Ukraine. Overnight, the Ukrainian president appealed directly to Moscow, Chris Livesay reports for ""CBS Saturday Morning."" ""Time to talk,"" Zelenskyy said. ""It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia's losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover."" Across Ukraine, the Pentagon estimates more than 7,000 Russian troops have been killed so far. But Putin is not projecting an image of compromise, vowing at a packed rally that Russia will prevail. Many attendees told reporters they were under pressure to come out in support of him. Putin reiterated his claim that Ukrainian civilians had welcomed Russia's troops. But the heartache tells the truth. In Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, a son cried over the body of his mother, who was killed by falling debris. And Mariupol — the scene of Russia's most vicious onslaught — is encircled in siege warfare, leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped without food, water, heat and electricity. Russia says it's now ""tightening the noose"" on the strategic Black Sea city, even deploying Islamist troops from its Chechnya region. A video purportedly released by Chechnya's pro-Putin leader shows them engaging with Ukrainian fighters positioned in the upper floors of a building. Meanwhile, in the eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces have been holding firm in the face of ferocious Russian shelling. For more than three weeks, Russia has tried, and failed, to break through the city. The battle for Ukraine is extending offshore. Ukraine's defense minister says Russian troops are blocking access to the Azov sea, which connects to the Black Sea.

The fall of Mariupol, the scene of some of the war's worst suffering, would mark a major battlefield advance for the Russians, who are largely bogged down outside major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europe since World War II. ""Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it is wiped off the face of the earth,"" Mariupol police officer Michail Vershnin said from a rubble-strewn street in a video addressed to Western leaders that was authenticated by The Associated Press. Russian forces have already cut the city off from the Sea of Azov, and its fall would link Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to territories controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in the east. It would mark a rare advance in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance that has dashed Russia's hopes for a quick victory and galvanized the West. Ukrainian and Russian forces battled over the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Vadym Denysenko, adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said Saturday. ""One of the largest metallurgical plants in Europe is actually being destroyed,"" Denysenko said in televised remarks. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said the nearest forces that could assist Mariupol's defenders were already struggling against ""the overwhelming force of the enemy"" or at least 100 kilometers (60 miles) away.

2022-03-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-weapons-us-allies-providing/,The weapons the U.S. and allies are providing to Ukraine,"The U.S. has given more than $2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration, with about $1 billion last week alone, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an impassioned plea for more from Congress, asking for more defensive assistance as his country struggles to fight off the Russian invasion. There are some items Ukrainians want that the U.S. cannot provide, either because of a lack of inventory or the risk of provoking a wider war. Zelenskyy has asked the U.S. to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine to diminish the Russian bombardment continuing to devastate the country. A no-fly zone would require American forces to police the airspace over Ukraine, which would almost certainly lead to a direct conflict between the U.S. and Russia. President Biden has drawn a red line that no U.S. forces will fight in Ukraine. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on his trip to Europe this week said there is no such thing as a ""no-fly zone light."" If the U.S. sets up a no-fly zone, it means the U.S. is in a conflict with Russia, he said. Absent a no-fly zone, the Ukrainians are seeking other avenues to help defend their skies, like fighter jets. Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly Soviet-era fighter jets, including the MiG-29 fighter jets. Some former Warsaw Pact countries, like Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria, have these jets in their inventories. The Polish government announced earlier this month it was willing to transfer its MiG-29s to the U.S. at Ramstein Airbase in Germany, where the U.S. could transfer the jets to Ukraine. But the Biden administration rejected this idea because flying aircraft from a U.S. base in Germany could be seen by Russia as an escalation of the conflict. Members of the U.S. Congress are still pushing for Ukraine to get MiG-29s somehow. The S-300 surface-to-air missile system is capable of shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles. It's a Russian-made air defense system, so the U.S. does not have any in its inventory. But there are NATO countries, including Slovakia, Greece and Bulgaria, that have these systems. The minister of defense of Slovakia said this week that Slovakia would be willing to immediately give an S-300 system to the Ukrainians if it receives a backfill system from the U.S. or other NATO allies. The U.S. has said only that it has no announcements to make. Germany and the Netherlands have subsequently said they would lend a Patriot air-defense system to Slovakia to fill the gap left by the S-300. The U.S. has provided over 7,000 Javelin anti-tank systems to Ukraine, according to the White House. The hallmark of the Javelin is its ""top attack"" capability: the missile flies 150 meters into the air and then strikes the tank from the top, where the armor is the thinnest. The Javelin is a shoulder-mounted weapon forces are able to carry with them. This missile system is considered a ""fire and forget"" weapon because it uses infrared guidance to find the target as soon as it's fired so that the operator can move immediately after launching or can prepare to fire another one. The Stinger is a portable surface-to-air missile system designed to go after aircraft. The Stinger missile's range can target planes and helicopters flying below 13,000 feet. Like the Javelin, the Stinger is a ""fire and forget"" system that uses an infrared guide to home in on a target. According to the White House, the U.S. has provided the Ukrainains with around 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems. The Stinger rose to fame in the 1980s, when the CIA provided the Mujahideen in Afghanistan with the weapon, giving them an effective means of targeting Soviet aircraft. In its most recent announcement of aid to Ukraine, the Biden administration listed ""100 tactical unmanned aerial systems"" or drones. U.S. officials have told CBS News the specific drones are the Switchblade drones from AeroVironment. The drones are considered ""kamikaze drones"" because they explode after hitting the target. There are two versions, the Switchblade 300 which is designed to go after personnel, and the Switchblade 600 which goes after armored equipment like tanks. In addition to the different systems above, the Biden administration in its most recent $800 million package of assistance is providing Ukraine with:",49,5.701396764134023,7.875398865838795,-2.1740021017047724,22

As the capital Kyiv reeled from more shelling, black smoke rose over the previously untouched city of Lviv for the first time on Friday morning. A Russian strike hit what was said to be a facility for the repair of military aircraft. Lviv is the largest city in western Ukraine. It sits only about 40 miles from the NATO territory across the border in Poland. Lviv's mayor said at least one person was wounded in the strike that hit just a few miles from the center of his city. In the heart of Lviv, meanwhile, there was a silent protest against the toll Russia's brutality has taken on Ukraine's most vulnerable. More than 100 empty strollers were placed in rows in a central square on Friday, symbolizing the children killed in the country since Putin's war began. ""The lives of our Ukrainian children. Today, 109 empty baby strollers were put up on Rynok Square in Lviv to show the whole world what a terrible price we pay,"" said Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Interior Ministry, in a post on the Telegram social media app. He shared a photo of the protest, adding: ""Ukraine is fighting for security around the world, losing their children!"" The United Nations has confirmed at least 816 civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia launched its war, with most of the deaths blamed on shelling and airstrikes. That figure includes 59 children, and the U.N.'s human rights agency acknowledges the ""actual toll is much higher."" CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the indiscriminate shelling of Kyiv continued spreading terror in the capital on Friday. Missiles and artillery slam into the once-thriving metropolis on a daily basis — sometimes several times a day — as Russian forces intensify their attacks across the country. Another residential building on the outskirts of Kyiv was in ruins on Friday, and as D'Agata reported, there's no telling when or where the next rocket, or rockets, will strike. To the east, close to the Russian border, Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv has been engulfed in flames. It has come under constant bombardment for weeks, since Vladimir Putin ordered his assault on Ukraine 23 days ago, on February 24. In the besieged city of Chernihiv, northwest of Kharkiv but still perilously close to Russian ground, an American teacher was among the civilians killed by Putin's assault on Thursday. James Hill, 68, had stayed in the city to look after his partner, Irina, who was being treated at a local hospital for MS. In Pittsburgh, Katya Hill recalled the last time she spoke with her brother. ""I could hear bombs in the background,"" she told CBS News. ""He was going out on a daily basis, searching for food. The hospital lost electricity. The hospital lost gas. There was no heat… my brother was a peacemaker and he was a giver, and he just felt everybody in the world should love each other.""

She was killed when fragments of a Russian missile, shot down by Ukrainian forces, rained down on their neighborhood. Even when a missile misses its target, it can wreak havoc. D'Agata and his team watched as residents of Kyiv's shell-shocked suburbs picked up the pieces of their lives and patiently lined up for plastic sheeting — some protection against the bitter cold, if not the searing shrapnel. The incredible destruction inflicted on residential buildings by the Russian missile that was stopped in its path made it clear why people in Ukraine's capital are so terrified of what's to come. But even with her neighborhood directly in the firing line, as she plucked jagged shards of glass from the window that no longer keeps out the bitter cold, Kyiv resident Gayla told CBS News that she was not going anywhere. ""It's ok, we won't freeze,"" she said. ""Love warms us up."" Asked if she had a message for those watching her country's destruction from afar, Galya said: ""Peace in Ukraine.

2022-03-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/james-hill-us-citizen-killed-ukraine/,"James Hill identified as 2nd American killed by ""Putin's senseless war""","Russian forces have been blamed for the death of a second U.S. citizen in Ukraine. After the war broke out, Minnesota native James Hill remained in the besieged northeastern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, very near Russia's border, to look after his partner Irina, who was being treated at a local hospital for multiple sclerosis. An adviser to Ukraine's interior minister identified Hill as one of the victims of a Russian attack on Thursday morning that targeted people lining up for food in Chernihiv. There were conflicting reports as to whether the civilians were hit by gun or artillery fire. The city is among the major population centers in eastern and southern Ukraine that have been decimated by Russian shelling for days as Vladimir Putin's ground forces remain bogged down by logistical problems and fierce Ukrainian resistance. Hill's sister Katya, in Pennsylvania, told CBS Pittsburgh that her brother had been living in the capital city of Kyiv, but traveled to Chernihiv for his partner's MS treatment. ""When I was warning him about the dangers, he did not feel that the world would let this happen, because my parents raised us to see the good in peoples' hearts, and that's how he lived,"" Katya told CBS Pittsburgh.

Filmmaker Brent Renaud, 50, was killed when Russian troops opened fire on him and colleagues in the town of Irpin, just outside Kyiv, as they were traveling to film refugees on March 13. One of his associates was injured in the attack. Veteran Fox News video journalist Pierre Zakrzewski and his local producer Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova were killed just two days later, on March 15, when their vehicle ""was struck by incoming fire"" near Kyiv. Zakrzewski was a European national based in London for Fox, while Kuvshynova was one of the many native Ukrainians who have joined foreign news crews to help report on the war in their country. Katya Hill told CBS Pittsburgh that her brother had been sharing updates with her every day since Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine on February 24. She hadn't spoken to him for a few days, however. She said the family learned of Hill's death from the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. ""After he said that he had no way to charge his phone, then I knew it was a matter of, are we going to hear he's in Poland safe or are we going to get the news that we didn't want to hear?"" Katya Hill said. ""A good person gone too soon,"" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a tweet, offering her ""deepest sympathies"" to Hill's family. ""Putin's senseless war is resulting in so much needless tragedy,"" the lawmaker added. The United Nations has confirmed at least 816 civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia launched its war, with most of the deaths blamed on shelling and airstrikes. That figure includes 59 children, and the U.N.'s human rights agency acknowledges the ""actual toll is much higher.""",47,3.385441214438806,3.2327330979388327,0.1527081164999733,1

The Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles, which carry lightweight, laser-guided bombs, normally excel in low-tech conflicts, and Turkey has sold them to more than a dozen countries, including Azerbaijan, Libya, Morocco and Ethiopia. The drones have carried out unexpectedly successful attacks in the early stages of Ukraine's conflict with Moscow, before the Russians were able to set up their air defenses in the battlefield, said Jack Watling of the London-based Royal United Services Institute. An unspecified number of U.S.-made drones will be among the additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine announced Wednesday by President Joe Biden. It also includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 100 grenade launchers, 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition, and grenade launchers and mortar rounds. The White House has been weighing giving Ukraine access to U.S.-made Switchblade drones that can fly and strike Russian targets, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. It was not immediately clear if the new drones that Biden said would be delivered to Ukraine include those or others. ""The (Turkish TB2s) shouldn't be making a meaningful impact because they are medium altitude, slow-flying aircraft with a large electromagnetic signature and a large radar cross-section. And the Russians have very capable air defense systems, so they should be being shot down. The terrain is very open and gives good radar coverage,"" Watling added. He said Ukrainian forces ""have been essentially flying in at a low-level and then coming up and raiding with them. So striking targets of opportunity."" Over time, as the Russians get more organized and push out their air defenses, Watling said ""the freedom to employ those drones is diminishing. And so what we are now seeing is that the Ukrainians are having to be careful as to when they commit them."" In a briefing to Parliament on March 9, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace praised the drones, along with other weapons donated to Ukraine by the West. ""One of the ways they are delivering close air support or actual fire in depth is through the Turkish TB2 UAVs, which are delivering munitions onto their artillery and indeed their supply lines, which are incredibly important in order to slow down or block the Russian advance,"" Wallace said. The drones also have scored success on social media. Their aerial video of the destruction of Russian armored vehicles has become a key tool for Ukraine's information war. Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, shared videos of drone attacks on Twitter, including one that appeared to show a convoy of destroyed Russian military vehicles. ""Masallah"" or ""Praise be"" he wrote in a caption on one of the videos. A video using a song titled ""Bayraktar"" ‒ with sounds of explosions timed to coincide with the beats ‒ has been uploaded on YouTube and played on Ukrainian radio. ""So as long as they still fly in, as long as they're still armed, they will be useful. They will mostly be useful for the propaganda side,"" said Aaron Stein, director of research at the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute. ""The videos have enraptured people because you can see an airstrike in high definition."" Turkey began selling the TB2 drones to Ukraine in 2019, and Kyiv used them in fighting Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region - a move that Moscow called ""destabilizing."" Turkish officials have refused to disclose details of the drone sales to Ukraine, including how many were involved and whether Kyiv is being resupplied. Independent estimates put the number of TB2s in Ukraine at between 20 and 50. The drones ‒ priced under $2 million each according to estimates ‒ are produced by the Baykar defense company, which belongs to the family of Selcuk Bayraktar, the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Bayraktar is Baykar's chief technical officer. The TB2 has been credited with helping tip the balance of conflicts in Libya, as well as to Turkey's ally Azerbaijan in fighting with Armenian-backed forces in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region in 2020. Ankara has also used the drones against Kurdish militants in Turkey and northern Iraq as well as against Kurdish fighters in Syria. Such less-expensive drones are likely to have a lasting impact on warfare as a useful tool of attrition, as well as being able to draw in the attention of more expensive enemy jets, Stein said. ""I'd call it the Toyota Corolla of drones. ... It doesn't do everything that your high-end sports car does, but it does 80% of that, right?"" he said. ""So even for a high-end military, like the U.S., the basic concept of using in an attritable, cheap platform to strike a superior force has inherent value.""

Merefa Mayor Veniamin Sitov said the attack occurred just before dawn on Thursday. The Kharkiv region, like most other major population centers in eastern Ukraine, has seen heavy bombardment as stalled Russian forces try to advance in the area.

As CBS News correspondent Imitaz Tyab reports, in Russia's war of attrition, it appears that nothing is off limits. Not even a theater in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol that was said to be sheltering more than 1,000 people. It was clearly marked with the word ""children"" scrawled in huge Russian writing. But it was reduced to ruins on Wednesday. Ukrainian officials called it the latest atrocity by Russian forces, but there was hope on Thursday morning that many of those who had turned to the theater as a safe haven might have survived. ""The bomb shelter held,"" Petro Andrushchenko, an advisor to Mariupol's mayor, told the Reuters news agency on the phone. ""Now the rubble is being cleared. There are survivors. We don't know about the victims yet."" ""We don't know yet whether we have wounded people, or killed people. But it looks like most of them have survived and are okay,"" Dmytro Gurin, a Ukrainian lawmaker whose parents are trapped in Mariupol, told the BBC. Russia denies bombing the building, accusing the Ukrainian Azov Battalion, a militia with neo-Nazi sympathies, of blowing it up. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova repeated the Kremlin's frequent refrain on Thursday in Moscow, telling reporters that ""Russia's armed forces don't bomb towns and cities."" Russia has offered no proof, however, to back up its claim that the Azov group rigged the theater with explosives to stage a provocation. At a nearby hospital, scenes of utter carnage were painfully clear. Medics did what they could to help in the wake of the latest destruction in Mariupol, but officials say more than 2,000 civilians have been killed by Russia's artillery and missile fire in the city so far. The youngest of the victims was just 22 days old. ""These are all the people we could not save,"" lamented one brave doctor. The city has collapsed into chaos as Russian soldiers encircle it. Each airstrike and shelling — one every minute at times — slowly squeezes the life out of the once thriving seaport. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, another inferno. Tyab said Russian shelling hit a market there, killing at least three people. ""I think there were several rockets or Grad missiles,"" recalled one witness. ""Boom, boom, boom, and then the fire broke out."" It's a hell that has sent more than 3 million Ukrainians fleeing to other countries, and displaced millions more within their own. Among them, a group of orphans who were rescued less than a week ago from brutal violence in the country's war-torn east. ""They have both physical and mental disabilities,"" explains Natali, a social worker in the western city of Lviv who is helping the children. As he spoke to Tyab, another air raid siren went off. Natali shouted at the older kids to run inside and take cover while carers carefully gathered up the younger ones, guiding them down a flight of stairs into a basement classroom. The carers played games with the kids to try to smooth their fears. ""The children don't hear the sirens from here. They are hidden,"" Nadeeya, one of the teachers, told CBS News. ""We are safe here."" The orphans may be among Ukraine's most vulnerable, but they are deeply cared for, and even with such uncertain futures, they still manage to smile and make new friends as they hide from Russian bombs.

In the war's third week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested there was still some reason to be optimistic that negotiations with the Russian government might yet yield an agreement. Previewing his speech to the U.S. Congress, Zelenskyy thanked President Joe Biden and ""all the friends of Ukraine"" for $13.6 billion in new support. He appealed for more weapons and more sanctions to punish Russia and repeated his call to ""close the skies over Ukraine to Russian missiles and planes."" Zelenskyy said Russia's demands were becoming ""more realistic"" after their delegations met Tuesday via video. The sides were expected to speak again later Wednesday. ""Efforts are still needed, patience is needed,"" he said in his video address to the nation. ""Any war ends with an agreement."" He said Russian forces had been unable to move deeper into Ukrainian territory but had continued their heavy shelling of cities. Developments on the diplomatic front and on the ground occurred as the number of people fleeing Ukraine amid Europe's heaviest fighting since World War II eclipsed 3 million. Zelenskyy said 28,893 civilians were able to flee through nine humanitarian corridors in the past day although the Russians refused to allow aid into Mariupol. The U.N. said close to 700 civilians in Ukraine have been confirmed killed, with the true figure probably much higher. Ukraine's prosecutor said Wednesday that 103 children have been killed there since Russia invaded, according to the Reuters news service. Fighting has intensified on Kyiv's outskirts, and the mayor imposed a curfew through Thursday morning. Shrapnel from an artillery shell slammed into a 12-story apartment building in central Kyiv on Wednesday, obliterating the top floor and igniting a fire that sent plumes of smoke over the area, according to a statement and images released by the Kyiv emergencies agency. The neighboring building was also damaged. Agence France-Press cited the emergencies agency as saying two people were wounded and 35 evacuated. Also, a powerful explosion thundered overnight in Kharkiv and was heard across the eastern city. In addition to airstrikes and shelling by ground forces, Russian naval ships fired overnight on a town south of Mariupol on the Azov Sea and another near Odesa on the Black Sea, according to local officials. AFP said at least four people were killed and 40 injured on Tuesday when a Russian strike set an apartment building ablaze in Kyiv's Sviatoshynsky district. Several other buildings were also struck. Russian forces have intensified fighting in the Kyiv suburbs, notably around the town of Bucha in the northwest and the highway leading west toward Zhytomyr, the head of the Kyiv region Oleksiy Kuleba said. He said Russian troops are trying to cut off the capital from transport arteries and destroy logistical capabilities even as they plan a wide-ranging attack to seize Kyiv. Twelve towns around Kyiv are without water and six without heat. Russia has occupied the city of Ivankiv, 50 miles north of Kyiv, and controls the surrounding region on the border with Belarus, Kuleba said. Across the Kyiv region, he said, ""Kindergartens, museums, churches, residential blocks and engineering infrastructure are suffering from the endless firing."" A senior U.S. defense official, speaking to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon's assessment, said Tuesday the Russians were using long-range fire to hit civilian targets inside Kyiv with increasing frequency but that their ground forces were making little to no progress around the country. The official said Russian troops were still about 9 miles from the center of the capital. Before Tuesday's talks with Ukrainian officials, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow would press its demands that Ukraine drop its bid to join NATO, adopt a neutral status and ""demilitarize."" In a statement that seemed to signal potential grounds for agreement with Moscow, Zelenskyy told European leaders gathered in London that he realizes NATO has no intention of accepting Ukraine. ""We have heard for many years about the open doors, but we also heard that we can't enter those doors,"" he said. ""This is the truth, and we have simply to accept it as it is."" NATO doesn't admit nations with unsettled territorial conflicts. Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he realizes NATO isn't going to offer membership to Ukraine and that he could consider a neutral status for his country but needs strong security guarantees from both the West and Russia. On a day when thousands managed to leave Mariupol, Russian troops seized the city's largest hospital, regional leader Pavlo Kyrylenko said. He said the troops forced about 400 people from nearby homes into the Regional Intensive Care Hospital and were using them and roughly 100 patients and staff as human shields by not allowing them to leave. Kyrylenko said shelling had already heavily damaged the hospital's main building, but medical staffers have been treating patients in makeshift wards in the basement. Doctors from other Mariupol hospitals made a video to tell the world about the horrors they've been seeing. ""We don't want to be heroes and martyrs posthumously,"" one woman said. She also said it's insufficient to simply refer to people as the wounded: ""It's torn off arms and legs, gouged out eyes, bodies torn into fragments, insides falling out."" The employee of Russian state television who was arrested after interrupting a live news program by protesting the war in Ukraine was fined about about $270 but still could face a prison sentence. ""These were very difficult days of my life because I literally went two full days without sleep, the interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours and they didn't allow me to contact my family and close friends, didn't provide any legal support,"" Marina Ovsyannikova said after she was released. Ovsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked into the studio during Monday's evening news show with a poster saying ""stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here."" In English, it said ""no war"" at the top of the poster and ""Russians against the war"" at the bottom. Two journalists working for Fox News were killed in a vehicle hit by fire Monday on the outskirts of Kyiv. Fox identified them as video journalist Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova, who was helping Fox crews navigate the area. Another journalist was killed Sunday in Ukraine. On Tuesday, the leaders of three European Union countries - Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia - visited Kyiv in a bold show of support amid the danger.",47,2.1511982961948863,2.1241605847227842,0.0270377114721021,11
2022-03-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-putin-war-criminal/,"Biden calls Putin a ""war criminal"" in sharpest condemnation since Ukraine invasion","Washington — President Biden on Wednesday called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal,"" marking the first time the president has used the term to characterize his Russian counterpart since Moscow launched the invasion of Ukraine nearly three weeks ago. Mr. Biden made the comment to a group of reporters at the White House after an event on the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Asked whether Putin is a ""war criminal,"" the president initially said no and walked away, but then returned to the members of the press and, when the question was repeated, said he thinks the Russian leader is a war criminal. ""Oh, I think he is a war criminal,"" the president responded without elaborating. White House press secretary Jen Psaki pointed to the bombing of a maternity hospital among other Russian aggressions in Ukraine. ""We have all seen barbaric acts, horrific acts, by a foreign dictator in a country that is threatening and taking the lives of civilians, impacting hospitals, women who are pregnant, journalists, others,"" she said. ""I think he was answering a direct question."" Psaki said a legal review is underway at the State Department to review Russia's actions in Ukraine and whether they constitute war crimes. Putin's press secretary reacted angrily to Mr. Biden's comments, according to TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency. ""We consider unacceptable and unforgivable such rhetoric of the head of state, whose bombs killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world,"" said Dmitry Peskov. Mr. Biden's comment came as Russia has continued its bombardment of civilians in Ukraine, with the loss of lives and suffering growing. On Tuesday, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution condemning the violence in Ukraine and calling for an investigation of Putin and members of his regime for war crimes The International Court of Justice has ordered Russia to cease its invasion and opened an investigation into the war. The United Nations human rights office registered roughly 600 civilian deaths, though the toll is expected to be much higher. More than 2,000 people are believed to have been killed in the port city of Mariupol alone, according to Ukrainian officials. The U.N. estimates 3 million people have fled Ukraine because of Russia's war, while another nearly 2 million have been internally displaced. The U.N. said the refugee crisis in Ukraine is the fast-growing in Europe since World War II. On Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine said Russian forces shot and killed 10 people who were standing in line for bread in Chernihiv, a city in northeast Ukraine that was hit in a Russian artillery strike. ""Such horrific attacks must stop. We are considering all available options to ensure accountability for any atrocity crimes in Ukraine,"" the embassy said in a tweet. Local officials in Ukraine and Dmytro Kuleba, the country's minister off foreign affairs, on Wednesday said Russian troops struck a theater in Mariupol where ""hundreds"" of civilians were sheltering. ""Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter,"" Kuleba tweeted, along with a photo purporting to show the besieged theater. Mr. Biden announced $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine Wednesday morning, including armed drones. But the new security assistance does not include fighter jets or impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy requested in a virtual address to Congress Wednesday morning. ""Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,"" Zelenskyy said in his speech, during which he played for lawmakers a graphic video showing the extent of the death and destruction in Ukraine by Russia. Mr. Biden, who watched the speech from the White House residence, called Zelenskyy's speech ""passionate.""",47,3.5075118532759393,4.022697526233443,-0.5151856729575033,26

The Russian defense ministry said its forces had not struck the building and blamed the attack on the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia, RIA news agency reported. Mariupol, a southern seaport of 430,000 residents, has become a symbol of Russian President Vladimir Putin's drive to crush democratic Ukraine - but also of a fierce resistance on the ground. In the nearly three weeks since Russia's war began, two Associated Press journalists have been the only international media present in Mariupol, chronicling its fall into chaos and despair. The city is now encircled by Russian soldiers, who are slowly squeezing the life out of it, one blast at a time. Several appeals for humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians went unheeded, until Ukrainian officials said Wednesday that about 30,000 people had fled in convoys of cars. Airstrikes and shells have hit the maternity hospital, the fire department, homes, a church, a field outside a school. For the estimated hundreds of thousands who remain, there is quite simply nowhere to go. The surrounding roads are mined and the port blocked. Food is running out, and the Russians have stopped humanitarian attempts to bring it in. Electricity is mostly gone and water is sparse, with residents melting snow to drink. Some parents have even left their newborns at the hospital, perhaps hoping to give them a chance at life in the one place with decent electricity and water. People burn scraps of furniture in makeshift grills to warm their hands in the freezing cold and cook what little food there still is. The grills themselves are built with the one thing in plentiful supply: bricks and shards of metal scattered in the streets from destroyed buildings. Death is everywhere. Local officials have tallied more than 2,500 deaths in the siege, but many bodies can't be counted because of the endless shelling. They have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets because it's too dangerous to hold funerals. Many of the deaths documented by the AP were of children and mothers, despite Russia's claims that civilians haven't been attacked. Doctors say they are treating 10 civilians for every injured Ukrainian soldier.

""Russians have killed more than ten people who were standing in line to buy some bread,"" he said in his tweet. The alleged attack came a day after Ukraine's general prosecutor's office said a Russian artillery strike had hit a university and open-air market in Chernihiv on Monday, killing 10. It was one of many strikes to hit the city over the last three weeks. The governor of the region said Wednesday that electricity had been cut to Chernihiv city and some surrounding towns and villages, but the Reuters news agency quoted Governor Viacheslav Chaus as saying Ukraine's armed forces were dealing ""powerful blows on the Russian enemy every hour."" On Tuesday, Reuters interviewed Mykola Vasylinko in Kyiv, who said he had just fled to the capital from Chernihiv, where the situation was ""much worse."" ""This is no Chernihiv,"" he told Reuters. ""They [Russian forces] have tried to erase [it] from the Earth's surface. They bomb residential areas, they specifically target residential buildings."" Chernihiv is one of several large cities very close to Ukraine's northeast border with Russia that have come under blistering artillery fire since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion and air war against Ukraine to start on February 24.",47,3.236235949487022,4.65878486197173,-1.4225489124847082,11
2022-03-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-vladimir-putin-shelling-port-cities-mariupol-mykolaiv-odesa/,Inside Russian leader Vladimir Putin's brutal war of annihilation on Ukraine's port cities of Mariupol and Mykolaiv,"Mykolaiv, Ukraine — Vladimir Putin's forces are pummeling Ukraine's southern port cities. Mykolaiv was hit again by shelling early Tuesday morning. As CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay reports, it's a city that stands at a crossroads between Odesa, Ukraine's biggest port that Russia desperately wants, and Mariupol, a city Russia has already encircled. In both Mariupol and Mykolaiv, Livesay says people are doing everything they can just to survive what Ukrainian officials call a war of annihilation by Russia's leader. Aerial video surfaced on Monday showing the horrific destruction of besieged Mariupol. Smoke rises from the charred carcasses of apartment buildings. The once thriving port city has been left in ruins. Officials say more than 2,000 civilians have been killed there alone. ""An elementary school was here,"" said resident Dima, pointing to a space devoid of anything but rubble. ""There were no military at this school."" Video released by Ukraine's National Guard shows its armored vehicles going toe to toe with Russia's, zigzagging through residential streets that have become a concrete battlefield. The brutal urban warfare has left hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in the freezing cold without heat, water, food or electricity. And while the bombing is chillingly indiscriminate, it is also by design: One by one, Putin's forces are terrorizing Ukraine's major ports as they grind slowly toward their goal of capturing Odesa. To get there, however, they first must get through, or around, Mykolaiv. Not if the local governor, Vitaly Kim, has anything to say about it. He's taken to social media to show off captured Russian military hardware, and his regular, charismatic videos have gone viral in Ukraine. Asked what he's learned about Russia as a military foe over the last week, Kim laughed and said he had to learn everything from scratch, because just two weeks ago, he knew ""nothing about war."" Now he knows it all too well. Mykolaiv has been shelled relentlessly for days. Over the weekend at least four people were killed while hiding in a bomb shelter beneath a school. Governor Kim has asked citizens to donate old tires, to pile up and set on fire in a bid to disorient the enemy in case of a full-on invasion. His residents responded, and there are mounds of tires and other barricades all around the city now. Kim even has a few Ukrainian tanks of his own, which he proudly shows off in his videos. The charisma of Ukraine's leaders has been wielded as a powerful weapon, and Russia knows it. Ukraine says it's why Russia has abducted at least two of its cities' mayors already, with the goal of being to replace them with pro-Russian puppets.",47,3.759916919371811,5.900216745995227,-2.1402998266234157,11

The state's head of public safety calls it an opportunity to make use of expired and out of service gear, while supporting the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom and democracy. The cutoff for donations was Monday afternoon, and the Colorado Department of Public Safety and the Colorado Department of Military and Veterans Affairs collected more than 1,000 ballistic helmets and nearly 840 complete sets of surplus body armor from over 25 local law enforcement agencies, a spokesperson for Gov. Jared Polis said in a news release. The effort began a week ago, after Polis called on local law enforcement agencies to donate their surplus body armor and ballistic helmets. ""That's our mission, trying to save lives,"" said Stan Hilkey, executive director for CDPS. ""Even if it's outside of our borders, it's still a noble mission and an opportunity for us to contribute."" Since then, Hilkey said donations had been piling up. They include body armor from the University of Colorado Boulder Police Department, as well as helmets and vests from Denver Police. The Colorado Department of Public Safety alone donated more than 700 helmets and 80 sets of body armor as well. Hilkey said each piece of equipment donated is no longer in use. ""Agencies often have very serviceable gear that has met its shelf life and been replaced, but agencies oftentimes don't have places to put that,"" Hilkey said. ""It actually helps departments get rid of that excess gear and it may save a life."" Hilkey said Colorado is one of several states collecting the protective equipment, which will be far more useful for Ukrainian citizens fighting off Russian forces. The logistics of getting the gear overseas are still being worked out, he said. ""Any amount helps, and if we save one life, it will have been worth an effort,"" Hilkey said. To ensure all materials met safety standards, donations were only accepted from law enforcement agencies and not from the general public. Polis' office said members of the public who want to support Ukraine are encouraged to make a financial donation to any of the international non-profit organizations that are helping civilians impacted by the war.",20,7.6310504698014014,6.396645274739931,1.2344051950614707,13

The U.S. has deployed two Patriot missile batteries, which are among the most sophisticated air defense systems in the world. The weapon defeats threats by shooting them out of the sky. ""All of these missiles are designed to defeat tactical ballistic missiles, designed to defeat cruise-type missiles, as well as aircraft,"" said the battery commander, who CBS News was asked not to name for security reasons. ""Regardless of intentional or accidental, the system actually does not have the means of discriminating against those, it identifies threats and we have the ability of defeating those threats."" The systems have been at this location for about a week, he said. It's not just the U.S. deploying Patriot missiles, Germany and the Netherlands are deploying them too as the war in Ukraine moves closer to NATO's doorstep. A Russian missile hit a military facility just 15 miles from the Polish border on Sunday. Local reports say a suspected Russian drone was found in Romania last week. The airport in Eastern Poland is also used as a way station for weapons going to Ukraine. On Tuesday, what appeared to be a convoy of trucks left the airport heading for the border. The U.S. is moving more than weapons — there are now 100,000 U.S. troops operating in Europe for the first time since 2005, including those at the site of the Patriot batteries.

2022-03-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-kyiv-frantic-rescue-effort-apartment-buildings/,At least 4 killed as Russian artillery hits apartment buildings in Kyiv,"Kyiv, Ukraine — The Russian offensive in Ukraine edged closer to central Kyiv on Tuesday even as the two countries kept open a narrow diplomatic channel with more talks planned. Shortly before dawn, large explosions thundered across the city as a series of Russian strikes hit a residential neighborhood, sparking a huge fire and a frantic rescue effort in a 15-story apartment building. At least four people were killed and others were trapped, the Reuters news agency quoted Mayor Vitali Klitschko as saying. Emergency services earlier said saying 27 people had been rescued. Shockwaves from an explosion also damaged the entry to a downtown subway station that has been used as a bomb shelter. City authorities tweeted an image of the blown-out facade, saying trains would no longer stop at the station. Mayor Vitali Klitschiko announced a curfew for Kyiv, saying everyone would need to remain indoors for 35 hours, between Tuesday evening and Thursday morning, according to the Reuters news agency. There was a rare glimmer of hope in the encircled port city of Mariupol after a convoy of 160 civilian cars left along a designated humanitarian route, the city council reported. Over the past 10 days or so, the lethal siege has pulverized homes and other buildings and left people desperate for food, water, heat and medicine. Ukraine hopes to open nine ""humanitarian corridors"" Tuesday to evacuate civilians from numerous cities and intends to attempt to bring humanitarian supplies to Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. The latest negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, held by video Monday, were the fourth round involving higher-level officials from the two countries and the first in a week. The talks ended without a breakthrough after several hours, with an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the negotiators took ""a technical pause"" and planned to meet again Tuesday. The two sides had expressed some optimism in the past few days. Mykhailo Podolyak, the aide to Zelensky, tweeted that the negotiators would discuss ""peace, cease-fire, immediate withdrawal of troops & security guarantees."" Previous discussions, held in person in Belarus, produced no lasting humanitarian routes or agreements to end the fighting. Zelensky is seeking to extend martial law until April 24 and to require men ages 18 to 60 to stay in the country to fight. Zelensky submitted the extension in a bill to parliament, which is expected to vote on it this week. Zelensky is slated to address the U.S. Congress Wednesday. In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that while the Biden administration supports Ukraine's participation in the talks with Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to show signs of de-escalating in order to demonstrate good faith. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned China against helping Russia during a long meeting in Rome with a senior Chinese diplomat Monday. Two U.S. officials told CBS News the Kremlin has asked China for support in its war against Ukraine. The request included military aid and equipment, and a U.S. official told CBS News Monday that the request mainly concerns financial assistance, but Russia also inquired about drones. The Russians don't seem to have anticipated that they or Ukraine would deploy drones in this conflict, which is one reason they're asking China about them, according to the U.S. official. The Ukrainians have been using drones, especially Turkish-made TB2 drones, quite effectively, a senior defense official noted in a background briefing Monday. The drones are used for reconnaissance as well as strikes and have been especially effective against Russian ground movements. The Kremlin has denied asking China for military equipment to use in Ukraine and China dismissed it as ""misinformation."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was able to continue the operation itself and insisted that it was ""unfolding in accordance with the plan and will be completed on time and in full."" In Kyiv, the early morning explosions were artillery strikes, the Ukrainian military said. They hit the Svyatoshynskyi district of western Kyiv, adjacent to the suburb of Irpin that has seen some of the worst battles of the war. Flames shot out of the apartment building as firefighters climbed ladders to rescue people. Smoke choked the air. Damage from unspecified ammunition prompted a fire in a 10-story apartment block in the Podilsky district of Kyiv, north of the government quarter. One person was hospitalized, the state emergency agency reported. Russian forces also stepped up strikes overnight on the northwest suburbs of Irpin, Hostomel and Bucha, said the head of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba. ""Many streets (in those areas) have been turned into a mush of steel and concrete. People have been hiding for weeks in basements, and are afraid to go out even for evacuations,"" Kuleba said on Ukrainian television. But overall, Russia has fallen far short of the progress Russian leaders anticipated, defense and intelligence officials tell CBS News. Russia's advance on Kyiv from three separate directions has made slow progress, with days when the troops remain stalled and sitting targets for Ukrainians. The slow advance may have prompted the Russian request for China's help. A senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press that Russian troops were still about 9 miles from the center of Kyiv. The official said Russian forces have launched more than 900 missiles but that Ukraine's airspace is still contested, with Russia not having achieved total air superiority. The Ukrainian general prosecutor's office on Tuesday released details of two deadly Russian attacks the day before. The office said an artillery strike had hit a university and open-air market, killing 10, and that a 65-year-old woman had been shot in a bus that was evacuating civilians from a Kyiv suburb. Russian artillery fire also hit a nine-story apartment building in the northern Obolonskyi district of the city, killing two more people, authorities said. A town councilor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, was killed in fighting there, officials said. And a Russian airstrike near a Ukrainian checkpoint caused extensive damage to a downtown Kyiv neighborhood, killing one person, Ukraine's emergency agency said. In an area outside Kyiv, Fox News reporter Benjamin Hall was injured while reporting and was hospitalized, the network said. In Russia, the live main evening news program on state television was briefly interrupted by a woman who walked into the studio holding a poster against the war. The OVD-Info website that monitors political arrests said she was a Channel 1 employee who was taken into police custody. Airstrikes were reported across the country, including the southern city of Mykolaiv and the northern city of Chernihiv, where heat was knocked out to most of the town. Explosions also reverberated overnight around the Russian-occupied Black Sea port of Kherson. Russian news agencies reported Tuesday that the Kremlin was claiming Russian troops had taken full control of the entire Kherson region, according to Reuters. Nineteen people were killed in a rocket attack on a TV tower in the western village of Antopol, according to local officials speaking with Agence France-Presse. In Mariupol, where the war has produced some of the greatest suffering, the city council didn't say how many people were in the convoy of cars headed westward for the city of Zaporizhzhia. But it said a cease-fire along the route appeared to be holding. Previous attempts to evacuate civilians and deliver humanitarian aid to the southern city of 430,000 were thwarted by fighting. Ukraine's military said it repelled an attempt Monday to take control of Mariupol by Russian forces, who were forced to retreat. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies showed fires burning across the city, with many high-rise apartment buildings heavily damaged or destroyed. The Kremlin-backed leader of the Russian region of Chechnya said on a messaging app that Chechen fighters were spearheading the offensive on Mariupol. The Russian military said Monday that 20 civilians in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine were killed by a ballistic missile launched by Ukrainian forces. The claim could not be independently verified. The U.N. has recorded at least 596 civilian deaths since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, though it believes the true toll is much higher. Millions more have fled their homes, with more than 2.8 million crossing into Poland and other neighboring countries in what the U.N. has called Europe's biggest refugee crisis since World War II. Russia's military is bigger and better equipped than Ukraine's, but its troops have faced stiffer-than-expected resistance, bolstered by arms supplied by the West.",47,5.377860451616382,2.172927659276506,3.204932792339876,11

But on Tuesday, they were rattled awake around 5 a.m. as the ground shook. The Russian military machine again turned its guns on Kyiv overnight, raining artillery down on residential neighborhoods. Pre-dawn explosions thundered in and around the city, with one strike on an apartment building killing at least four people, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko. It was one of the heaviest bombardments since the invasion began. Klitschko declared a curfew from Tuesday night until Thursday morning. He's estimated that more than half of Kyiv's 3 million inhabitants have already fled to safer regions or left the country altogether. The United Nations said Tuesday that 3 million people have left Ukraine seeking shelter in neigboring nations — Europe's biggest refugee crisis since the second World War. Others have taken up semi-permanent residence deep inside Kyiv's subway system, some even sleeping in trains. In the wooded outskirts of the city, Ukrainian soldiers have dug in. Ukraine's Defense Ministry released video showing off their presence, with anti-tank weapons and mortars. The video was reassurance for fellow Ukrainians, and a clear warning for Russians. D'Agata and his team have seen for themselves, however, that the defense buildup in and around Kyiv is not merely for show. Every single road is barricaded and manned by troops, reserves or volunteers. Among them, 32-year-old Volodymyr, an economist who just a few years ago was living and working in Washington D.C. ""We are ready for them,"" he told CBS News. ""You know, in Ukraine, we tell who comes to us, will die here."" He said the blood of invaders would be good for Ukraine's soil. At a local auto repair shop, D'Agata said it was like ""MacGyver"" meets ""Mad Max"" as he met Oleg, who was busy modifying weapons ripped off ruined Russian armored vehicles for use by Ukrainian fighters. Oleg said the work made him happy, as every weapon that comes in for him to work on is one more barrel pointing at Russian forces, rather than at Ukraine's people. In an overnight address, President Volodymyr Zelensky made an appeal directly to Russian soldiers: ""On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance, a chance to survive"" he said. ""If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated — as people, decently."" Despite days spent flattening suburbs like Irpin and Bucha with missiles and artillery — shelling that resumed overnight — Russia's ground forces have yet to advance to the capital. American officials believe they're within about 10 miles, but analysts say the approach has been slowed by logistical shortcomings and fierce Ukrainian resistance. Many in Kyiv fear the capital is now just awaiting the same fate as other Ukrainian cities closer to Russian territory, like Mariupol. The key port town has suffered from the full fury of Russian firepower for days. There was a glimmer of hope Monday as city officials confirmed some of the first civilian evacuations under a cease-fire agreed with Russia. But only around 160 vehicles were said to have left, and there are an estimated 400,000 people trapped in Mariupol, where food, water, heating and electricity supplies were cut days ago. Russian forces unleashed new artillery strikes in Kharkiv, meanwhile, in the northeast, in their ongoing effort to capture Ukraine's second largest city. The tactic is clear, and it is familiar from Russia's brutal campaign alongside dictator Bashar Assad in Syria: Where Russian forces encounter resistance and can't, or won't, quickly move in and seize a city, they surround it, and destroy it from afar. Across the country, Ukraine's tenacious forces refuse to give up ground. But its cities are increasingly under siege, and its civilians are paying a heavy price.",47,2.784575135781446,2.2701306013200666,0.5144445344613793,23

The previous rounds have enabled limited ""humanitarian corridors"" for civilians to evacuate some of the hardest-hit cities. While many of those efforts have failed quickly, with both sides blaming the other for cease-fire violations, evacuations appeared to be ramping up on Monday. Ukrainian officials said about 160 vehicles had finally managed to get people out of the besieged southern coastal city of Mariupol on Monday, and Russian news agency Interfax quoted the Defense Ministry in Moscow as saying Mariupol had been ""unblocked."" Even in the frontline towns near Kyiv, regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba said Monday that evacuations were going ahead for a fifth consecutive day. ""The ceasefire in our region is holding, albeit it is very conditional,"" Kuleba said on television, adding that explosions could still be heard in the distance. But despite the glimmers of hope, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the war seemed to be escalating by the hour. As the apartment building in Kyiv was hit Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted again that Russian artillery was only taking aim at military targets. Peskov repeated a claim issued earlier Monday by a mayor in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, which is held by Russian-backed separatists, that Ukrainian forces had fired a rocket at the city of Donetsk, ""which killed and wounded civilians."" Donetsk's pro-Russian mayor Aleksey Kulemzin said earlier that a Ukrainian missile had been shot down near Donetsk's city hall, creating a shower of debris that he said killed 17 people left 28 more injured. ""Of course, this is an attack on the civilian population,"" Peskov said. Russia has been accused of carrying out missile and airstrikes on residential buildings, hospitals and even schools for weeks, with the United Nations confirming about 600 civilians and acknowledging the true toll is likely much higher. Kyiv came under fire Monday on the heels of a massive round of Russian airstrikes that hit a Ukrainian military base right on Poland's doorstep, drawing the U.S. and its NATO allies closer than ever to the violence of this war. At least 35 people were killed in the Sunday strikes on the base, which has been used by American and NATO forces to train Ukrainian troops. The message from Moscow could not have been clearer. The strikes on the base — just 12 miles from the border with Poland, where the U.S. has deployed troops to bolster NATO's defenses — came a day after Russia warned that weapons and ""mercenaries"" flowing into Ukraine from Western nations would be considered ""legitimate targets."" Ukrainian officials said Russian warplanes fired about 30 missiles, 22 of which were intercepted by Ukraine's air defenses. The smile on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's face as he visited wounded troops in a hospital on Sunday, trying to boost spirits, was gone by the time he delivered a stark new warning overnight: ""I repeat again: If you do not close our skies, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory, on the territory of NATO and on the homes of citizens of NATO countries,"" Zelensky said. The Ukrainian leader has warned for months that Putin's intentions may go well beyond Ukraine's borders. The Red Cross said time was running out for hundreds of thousands of residents in Mariupol. Regional officials have reported at least 2,500 people killed in that city alone since in came under attack. Food, water and electricity supplies were all running out. Over the weekend, soldiers carried away the dead and wounded in the town of Irpin, just northwest of Kyiv, where residential neighborhoods have come under heavy bombardment for days. Many of those who've managed to escape the shelling and sniper fire in Irpin and nearby Bucha come to the neighboring village of Bilohorodka — some of them hitching rides in the back of cargo trucks as they don't have vehicles of their own. Upon arrival, they're handed warm drinks, water and something to eat. They're safe, for now, and looked after by neighbors who've chosen to stay behind to help, knowing full well they're right in the path of Russia's merciless advance toward the capital. ""I'm begging to be heard,"" said Eliana, a local helping those who have fled to her village. ""Close our skies so our kids can sleep calmly — so the whole country can live."" Alyona, another woman who was volunteering to help the evacuees, told D'Agata that while adults can at least understand what's happening to their country and try to help, children are scared. ""We try to explain that we have the greatest army, and they will protect us and defend us,"" she told CBS News. ""And they believe us."" ""We are frightened, very much,"" she admitted. But leaving, for her, was never an option, ""because we are Ukrainians. We can't do anything else. We can't go when, like, our people are dying here. We can't go away, we need to help them, it's our responsibility."" ""I'm a real Ukraine and I love so much my homeland and my people,"" agreed Natalia, another volunteer. ""We didn't flee away. We are Kyivites... We are staying here, to the last person!"" As they helped prepare food for the evacuees from Irpin, Oxana, another villager, repeated the plea made by her neighbor Eliana — one that is also made often by Ukrainian government officials: ""I'm asking your help. Stop this madhouse, give us no-fly zone, close the sky so we can handle the rest,"" she told D'Agata, adding that regardless of any foreign assistance, she and her neighbors would stand firm. ""We are so powerful. Not one of us will lower his head for Russians, nor in front of anyone. We don't surrender. On our land, staying until last minute."" D'Agata asked the volunteers if they would stay in their town, no matter what. They all replied ""yes,"" without hesitation. The United Nations says 2.7 million people have now fled Ukraine into neighboring nations, but that doesn't include the millions of people who have left their homes behind to seek refuge in other parts of their own country.

The bipartisan, 58-member Problem Solvers Caucus on Sunday became the latest group of lawmakers to push for Ukraine to receive more military assistance from the U.S., including help securing Stinger missiles, air-defense systems and fighter jets. ""Despite heroic and skillful resistance by Ukrainian forces, Russia currently retains air superiority over Ukraine,"" the group said in a statement. ""Russia's advantage in this domain could soon develop into air dominance if the Ukrainians do not receive necessary military aid."" The caucus urged the Biden administration to work with NATO allies to arrange and speed up the transfer of any available S-300 surface-to-air-missile systems to Ukraine. ""Providing Soviet-era platforms that Ukrainian service members have previously operated and maintained will be essential to their success on the battlefield and will also protect U.S. defense technology from falling into the hands of the Russians,"" the Problem Solvers Caucus said. Also on Sunday, Republican Senator Rob Portman and Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said separately that war planes are key tools for Ukraine as the country seeks to combat Russia's air power. Portman and Klobuchar are part of a four-member delegation that traveled to Poland over the weekend to meet with officials and visit refugee sites. ""What we have heard directly from the Ukrainians is they want them badly,"" Portman, of Ohio, said in an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union,"" referring to Soviet-style MiG-29 fighter jets. ""They want the ability to have better control over the skies in order to give them a fighting chance. So I don't understand why we're not doing it."" The Ohio Republican also said that while not ""top of the line,"" anti-aircraft systems like the S-300 are still ""very effective."" ""At a minimum, let's get those into Ukraine. And let's stop talking about it. Let's do it,"" he told CNN from Poland. ""But the airplanes are also essential."" Klobuchar, also on CNN, said she spoke with President Biden roughly 10 days ago and made clear that she supports sending fighter jets to Ukraine. ""I still don't rule out having planes at some point. But, again, you take one day at a time and make the best defense system decisions,"" she said. ""And that can't always be discussed on the air, or you would be giving Vladimir Putin the road map to what NATO wants to do here to help protect Ukraine."" Still, the Minnesota Democrat said planes, drones or Stingers and Javelin missiles would help Ukraine protect itself against Russia's continued attacks. ""One of the things we have to remember is, this is all about air defense,"" she said. The U.S. had been working on a deal with Poland to send their Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken told ""Face the Nation"" last week that the Polish government had ""a green-light"" for sending planes to Ukraine. But after Poland offered last week to deploy its MiG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base, a U.S. military installation in Germany, and ""place them at the disposal"" of the U.S., the Pentagon rejected the proposal, saying it is not a ""tenable one."" Still, top officials in Ukraine have continued to urge the U.S. and allies to give the country fighter jets. On Sunday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said warplanes are the ""highest demand"" and the ""most pressing issue."" ""If we lose control over the sky, we cannot prevent two things from happening: We cannot stop Russian bombers destroy[ing] our cities and killing civilians. And we cannot destroy Russian columns heading towards our big cities on the roads,"" Kuleba said in an interview with ""Face the Nation,"" when asked what types of military equipment Ukraine needs from allies and partners. ""To achieve these two purposes, we need more planes."" Kuleba called the back-and-forth last week over plans to give Ukraine jets a ""diplomatic mystery"" that was reminiscent of a game of ping-pong.",49,5.780881708720369,3.1231367510435066,2.657744957676863,27
2022-03-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/russia-ukraine-war-airstrike-polish-border-lviv/,"Russian airstrike hits base in western Ukraine near Polish border, killing 35","Lviv, Ukraine — Waves of Russian missiles pounded a military training base close to Ukraine's western border with NATO member Poland, killing 35 people. The strike followed Russian threats to target foreign weapon shipments that are helping Ukrainian fighters defend their country against Russia's grinding invasion. More than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted the sprawling training facility that is less than 15 miles from the closest border point with Poland, according to the governor of Ukraine's western Lviv region. Poland is a key location for routing Western military aid to Ukraine. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Lviv had largely been spared the scale of destruction unfolding further east and become a destination for residents escaping bombarded cities and for many of the nearly 2.6 million refugees who have fled the country. The training center in Yavoriv appears to be the most westward target struck so far in the 18-day invasion. The facility, also known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, has long been used to train Ukrainian military personnel, often with instructors from the United States and other NATO countries. It has also hosted international NATO drills. As such, the site symbolizes what has long been a Russian complaint: That the NATO alliance of 30 member countries is moving ever closer to Russia's borders. Russian has demanded that Ukraine drop its ambitions to join NATO. Lviv governor Maksym Kozytskyi said most of the missiles fired Sunday ""were shot down because the air defense system worked."" The ones that got through through killed at least 35 people and wounded 134, he said. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the strike was a ""new terrorist attack on peace&security near the EU-NATO border,"" and urged Western leaders to ""close the sky!"" U.S. and NATO allies have said they will not impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, since doing so would require shooting down Russian planes and risk sparking a wider war in Europe. Russian fighters also fired at the airport in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, 155 miles from Ukraine's border with Slovakia and Hungary, an attack the city's mayor said was intended ""to sow panic and fear."" The airport, which includes a military airfield as well as a runway for civilian flights, also was targeted Friday. Fighting also raged in multiple areas of the country overnight. Ukrainian authorities said Russian airstrikes on a monastery and a children's resort in the eastern Donetsk region hit spots where monks and refugees were sheltering, wounding 32 people. Another airstrike hit a westward-bound train evacuating people from the east, killing one person and injuring another, Donetsk's chief regional administrator said. To the north, in the city of Chernihiv, one person was killed and another injured in a Russian airstrike that destroyed a residential block, emergency services said. Around the capital, Kyiv, a major political and strategic target for the invasion, fighting also intensified, with overnight shelling in the northwestern suburbs and a missile strike Sunday that destroyed a warehouse to the east. Chief regional administrator Oleksiy Kuleba said Russian forces appeared to be trying to blockade and paralyze the capital with day and night shelling of the suburbs. Kuleba said Russian agents were operating in the capital and its suburbs, marking out possible future targets. He vowed that any all-out assault would meet stiff resistance, saying: ""We're getting ready to defend Kyiv, and we're prepared to fight for ourselves."" Talks aimed at reaching a cease-fire again failed Saturday, and the U.S. announced plans to provide another $200 million to Ukraine for weapons. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warned other nations that sending equipment to bolster Ukraine's military was ""an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of trying to break his country apart, as well as starting ""a new stage of terror"" with the alleged detention of a mayor from a city west of Mariupol. ""Ukraine will stand this test. We need time and strength to break the war machine that has come to our land,"" Zelensky said during his nightly address to the nation Saturday. Russian soldiers pillaged a humanitarian convoy that was trying to reach the battered and encircled port city of Mariupol, where more than 1,500 people have died, a Ukrainian official said. Ukraine's military said Russian forces captured Mariupol's eastern outskirts, tightening their siege of the strategic port. Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. An Associated Press journalist in Mariupol witnessed tanks firing on a nine-story apartment building and was with a group of hospital workers who came under sniper fire on Friday. A worker shot in the hip survived, but conditions in the hospital were deteriorating: Electricity was reserved for operating tables, and people with nowhere else to go lined the hallways. Among them was Anastasiya Erashova, who wept and trembled as she held a sleeping child. Shelling had just killed her other child as well as her brother's child, Erashova said, her scalp crusted with blood. ""No one was able to save them,"" she said. In Irpin, a suburb about 12 miles northwest of central Kyiv, bodies lay out in the open Saturday on streets and in a park. ""When I woke up in the morning, everything was covered in smoke, everything was dark. We don't know who is shooting and where,"" resident Serhy Protsenko said as he walked through his neighborhood. Explosions sounded in the distance. ""We don't have any radio or information."" Zelensky encouraged his people to keep up their resistance. ""We do not have the right to let up our defense, no matter how difficult it may be,"" he said. Later Saturday, Zelensky reported that 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers had died since the Russian invasion began Feb. 24. Zelensky again deplored NATO's refusal to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine and said Ukraine has sought ways to procure air defense assets, though he didn't elaborate. President Biden announced another $200 million in aid to Ukraine, with an additional $13 billion included in a bill that has passed the House and should pass the Senate within days. NATO has said that imposing a no-fly zone could lead to a wider war with Russia. The Ukrainian president also accused Russia of detaining the mayor of Melitopol, a city 119 miles west of Mariupol. The Ukrainian leader called on Russian forces to heed calls from demonstrators in the occupied city for the mayor's release. Moscow has said it would establish humanitarian corridors out of conflict zones, but Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of disrupting those paths and firing on civilians. Russian forces have hit at least two dozen hospitals and medical facilities, according to the World Health Organization. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said just nine of 14 agreed-upon corridors were open on Saturday, and that about 13,000 people had used them to evacuate around the country. French and German leaders spoke Saturday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a failed attempt to reach a cease-fire. According to the Kremlin, Putin laid out terms for ending the war. For ending hostilities, Moscow has demanded that Ukraine drop its bid to join NATO and adopt a neutral status; acknowledge the Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014; recognize the independence of separatist regions in the country's east; and agree to demilitarize. The Russian invaders appear to have struggled far more than expected against determined Ukrainian fighters. Still, Russia's stronger military threatens to grind down Ukrainian forces. Thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed along with many civilians, including at least 79 Ukrainian children, its government says. At least 2.5 million people have fled the country, according to the United Nations refugee agency.",47,2.1217413060816255,2.474740864893054,-0.3529995588114283,23

""This is obviously shocking and horrifying, and I've just learned about it as I came onto air here, so I will be consulting with my colleagues, we'll be consulting with the Ukrainians to determine how this happened and then to measure and execute appropriate consequences as a result of it,"" Sullivan told ""Face the Nation"" when asked about the consequences would be for the Russians killing an American. ""This is part and parcel of what has been the brazen aggression on the part of the Russians where they have targeted civilians, they have targeted hospitals, they have targeted places of worship and they have targeted journalists,"" he continued. The head of Kyiv's regional police force, Andriy Nebytov, said Sunday that a 50-year-old American journalist, believed to be Brent Renaud, was killed and a colleague was injured by Russian forces in Irpin, Ukraine. Nebytov posted photos on Facebook purportedly of Renaud's body, his U.S. passport and credentials from the New York Times. The Times said in a statement it is ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Renaud's death and said he was a ""talented filmmaker"" who contributed to the Times over the years. Renaud was not, however, on assignment for the Times in Ukraine. ""Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago,"" a spokesperson for the paper said. Sullivan said the Biden administration will be tracking developments regarding the attack on the journalists ""very closely and responding accordingly."" The attack on foreign journalists documenting the war in Ukraine comes after Russia fired more than 30 cruise missiles at a military training base located less than 15 miles from Ukraine's border with Poland, a member of NATO. The strike left 35 people dead, and the training facility is the most westward target hit by Russian forces so far in the 18 days since they invaded Ukraine. Sullivan warned Sunday that if there is a military attack on NATO territory, it would lead to the invocation of Article 5, which provides that if a NATO ally is the victim of an armed attack, each country in the 30-member alliance will consider it an armed attack against them all and take action. ""If Russia attacks, fires upon, takes a shot at NATO territory, the NATO alliance would respond to that,"" he said. Sullivan noted that President Biden has been clear that the U.S. would work with allies ""to defend every inch of NATO territory, and that means every inch."" Russia's continued action in Ukraine and rhetoric accusing the U.S. and Ukraine of using chemical or biological weapons has heightened concerns that Russian forces could use chemical weapons. Sullivan said the U.S. can't ""predict a time or place"" of a chemical weapons attack, but warned Russia is preparing for such a move and will try to ""pin the blame elsewhere."" ""Nobody should fall for that,"" he said. ""That is why we've gone out so decisively at the United Nations Security Council and elsewhere to rob the Russians of the capacity to pin this on anyone other than themselves. And as the president said on Friday, if in fact the Russians do use chemical weapons in Ukraine, they will pay a severe price."" Sullivan said the use of weapons of mass destruction by Russia would be a ""shocking additional line that [Vladimir] Putin is crossing in terms of his assault on international law and international norms, his assault on the human rights and human dignity of the people of Ukraine.""",45,2.3449905130728537,4.1292144554328445,-1.7842239423599908,23

Ground forces have moved to within 15 miles of Kyiv's center, according to Britain's Defense Ministry. Around the city, artillery barrages have sent residents heading for shelter. In Mariupol, which has faced some of the worst suffering since Russia began its Ukraine invasion, Russian forces shelled a mosque housing more than 80 people, including children, the Ukrainian government said on Saturday. The number of casualties wasn't immediately clear. Ukraine's president suggested the war has reached a ""strategic turning point"" as the shelling of neighboring cities intensifies. The U.S. is deploying additional troops to Eastern Europe to support NATO forces. It's also sending more weapons and billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. Mr. Biden on Friday reiterated his position that no American soldiers will go into battle. On Saturday, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that the U.S. has had limited contact with Russia since the war began. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has spoken to Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov, but the conversations were not productive. President Biden has not spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken has not spoken to his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov are not answering their phones, the officials said. Additionally, none of the outreach from French, German or Israeli officials appear to be going anywhere. Amid the developments, the civilian death toll is surging in the third week of the offensive. In the Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv, the night offers no rest. In an effort to break Ukraine off from vital access to the sea, Russian shelling has broken infrastructure, homes and families. Two weeks ago, some children – who are now forced to live in a basement beneath a derelict market – were playing hide and seek. Now they're hiding from banned cluster bombs, according to the local government. Their cold and dark bunker will only get fuller in the days ahead, says the mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych. CBS News' Chris Livesay asked him if Russia is attacking civilians on purpose. ""I think the main idea is to kill Ukrainians as much as they can,"" he said. ""It's a complete lie when they say they want to protect us. They want to kill as much Ukrainians as they can."" It's not only shelling civilians have to fear. In the occupied city of Melitopol, Russian soldiers captured the mayor, put a bag over his head and took him to an undisclosed location, in broad daylight. Across Ukraine, those brave enough to step outside find their cities mutilated. The contested eastern city of Volnovakha is now in the teeth of Russian separatists, brandishing a trademark Z to show loyalty to Putin. The international community has assessed with low confidence that between 2,000 and 4,000 Russian soldiers have died in action, while U.S. defense officials estimate, also with low confidence, the number to be somewhere closer to 5,000 or 6,000. Russia has not made its official death toll public. Margaret Brennan and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",47,2.107600391330478,4.187627574610693,-2.0800271832802153,11

2022-03-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin-war-crimes/,"Putin may be committing war crimes, but do the allegations have any teeth?","The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into the war in Ukraine as pressure mounts to prosecute Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal. The case against Putin could come together quickly as the list of alleged violations grows: the bombing of a maternity hospital, the shelling of civilian targets and an attack on a nuclear power plant that raised the specter of a nuclear disaster in the heart of Europe. But a conviction could prove elusive. The International Criminal Court, which the U.S. is not part of, has a track record of 10 convictions over two decades. ""The first way that they can build it — and it may be sufficient in this case — they can look at the pattern of the attack,"" Stephen Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes, told CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge. Rapp, who has built cases against dictators and sought accountability for genocide, said Putin would be seen as ""an international pariah"" if there is a war crimes designation against him. ""It also means that he can't travel anywhere, no more summits, because he'd be putting himself in danger,"" Rapp said. Securing justice in the court does not happen quickly. The court had to pull the arrest warrant for Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi after he was executed by his own people. Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad remains in power nearly a decade after he allegedly used chemical weapons against Syrians. Even though the U.S. is not part of the International Criminal Court, a National Security Council spokesperson told CBS News that the U.S. is already collecting evidence of alleged war crimes and human rights abuses that could be used in a criminal prosecution. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv called the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant a ""war crime."" But hours later, the White House dialed back the language. ""We have not made conclusions, it's a legal review and a process that goes through at the administration,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. Rapp said the bar is ""very high"" to prove that war crimes have been committed, but ""given the intensity of this campaign and the civilian destruction, I think that can be developed in a matter of weeks."" Matthew Kroenig, who worked the Russia and nuclear portfolios for the intelligence community under the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, told CBS News there's a rising threat from Russia's stockpile of lower-yield weapons known as tactical nukes. ""These are weapons that would be used not for, say, attacking Washington or New York, but for winning a battle on the field in Ukraine,"" Kroenig said. Use of tactical nuclear weapons against civilians would be ""a war crime of the highest order,"" he said. This week, intelligence officials warned of a Russian policy called ""escalate to deescalate,"" which means the use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield to intimidate an adversary. ""I think before he lost the war, he would try to use nuclear weapons to try to pull victory from the jaws of defeat,"" Kroenig said of Putin. ""I think the risk of nuclear war is still low. But I think the risk is higher now than any time we've seen in recent years.""",45,5.37330480471256,4.111435495178506,1.2618693095340534,8

The government hoped to at least get some humanitarian aid into the worst affected areas, as Russia looked poised to make a new push to take major cities, including Kyiv. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports residents are running for their lives from Ukraine's capital. Just a month ago, Kyiv was a thriving European metropolis home to almost 3 million people. Now, hunkering down, hiding out and hoping the worst won't happen is no longer an option. ""The snipers have taken over my house,"" said Valentina, a school teacher. ""They're shooting in the direction of my son's house, my only son."" Not everyone gets away. Terrifying scenes have been unfolding in the neighborhoods of Irpin and Bucha, just a few miles from central Kyiv. Ukrainian officials say about 2,500 civilians have been killed since Russia launched its invasion 16 days ago. New satellite images of the huge Russian military convoy north of the capital suggest it might finally be on the move again after being stalled for days by logistical issues and fierce Ukrainian resistance. The troops appear to be repositioning in preparation for a possible assault on, or siege of the capital. As D'Agata reports, that's exactly what the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, has been subjected to for days. But Russia has paid a heavy price. The bodies of Russian soldiers litter the ground around Kharkiv, and after two weeks of ferocious battle and relentless artillery fire, Russia still hasn't taken control. A regional official said Friday that Russian forces had shelled residential areas of Kharkiv 89 times in just 24 hours, with some of the strikes hitting an institute containing a nuclear laboratory that Russia claimed several days ago was being prepared by Ukrainian forces for a staged ""provocation."" Kharkiv Governor Oleh Synegubov said there were ""no threats to the civilian population yet"" from the strikes that hit the nuclear facility specifically, but as D'Agata reports, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been no match for Russia's artillery and aerial bombardment. Civilians in Kharkiv and other battered cities report seemingly indiscriminate killing, with targets, including hospitals and residential neighborhoods. After a strike on a maternity and children's hospital Wednesday in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol drew international condemnation of Russia — and a denial from Moscow — Governor Synegubov said Friday that a health facility in his region had been struck. He said a psychiatric hospital near the town of Izyum, about 50 miles southeast of the city of Kharkiv, was hit by Russian fire in a ""brutal attack on civilians."" The Reuters news agency quoted him as saying that about 70 people had been evacuated from the facility, which housed 330. He said emergency services were working to assess casualties. The onslaught of artillery fire and airstrikes is President Vladimir Putin taking advantage of the West's refusal to risk a direct confrontation with Russia by imposing a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine. He's used the tactic before, most recently in Syria, where his forces surrounded and then destroyed entire cities to beat rebel fighters into submission. But D'Agata says when it comes to Russia's ground assault in Ukraine, the Ukrainian forces have two advantages: They're fighting on their own turf, and they're determined to defend every inch of it. One Ukrainian soldier holding a line on the edge of Kharkiv said the Russian forces he was up against — who were only about half a mile from his position — were using outdated tactics.

The findings come as Russian forces continued their airstrikes on the port city of Mariupol on Thursday, the AP said. The images, taken by Maxar Technologies, ""showed that 40-mile (64-kilometer) convoy of vehicles, tanks and artillery has broken up and been redeployed, with armored units seen in towns near the Antonov Airport north of the city,"" the AP reports. The artillery pieces have been moved into firing positions, the AP said. The convoy had been outside of Kyiv since early last week, the AP reports. But Ukrainian forces, as well as reported food and fuel shortages, slowed the convoy's advance. Meanwhile, Britain on Thursday accused Russia of a ""war crime"" for an attack the previous day on a children's and maternity hospital in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Ukrainian officials have said that at least three people, including a young girl, were killed in the strike, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky labelled an ""atrocity"" soon after it happened. U.K. armed forces minister James Heappey said Thursday that regardless of whether it was ""indiscriminate"" fire by Russia into a built-up area or a deliberate targeting of a health facility, ""it is a war crime."" U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking alongside Poland's president Thursday in Warsaw, noted the attack on the hospital and said the world was witnessing ""atrocities of unimaginable proportions in Ukraine."" ""We stand with the people of Ukraine,"" Harris said after reaffirming America's ""ironclad"" commitment to defend NATO nations. Asked later if she believed Russia's actions should be investigated as possible war crimes, Harris said ""when it comes to crimes and violations of international norms"" the U.S. was ""clear that any intentional attack on innocent victims is a violation."" She said the United Nations had an established process to determine whether war crimes had been committed, and ""absolutely there should be an investigation. The eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done."" Speaking after talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Thursday in Turkey, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the claims of a Russian attack on a functioning hospital as lies and propaganda. ""It is not the first time we have seen pathetic outcries concerning the so-called atrocities"" by Russia, Lavrov said, claiming the hospital was being used as a base by an ""ultra-radical"" Ukrainian battalion. He said Russia had submitted data to the United Nations ""days ago"" to prove its claim, and accused foreign media of manipulating information on the strike. Lavrov claimed no patients or staff had been at the facility, which he insisted had ""long ago become a base for extremists."" CBS News' Pamela Falk reported from United Nations headquarters that Russia's U.N. ambassador Vassily Nebenzia did tell Security Council members on March 7 that ""locals"" in Mariupol had reported ""that Ukraine's Armed Forces kicked out personnel of natal hospital #1 of the city of Mariupol and set up a firing site within the facility."" Nebenzia offered no evidence to support the claim, and Russia has been accused for weeks by the West of making false statements to create a pretext for attacks in Ukraine. Later on Thursday, Russia's Defense Ministry denied having attacked the hospital at all, accusing Ukrainian forces of a ""staged provocation"" at the facility. ""We lost three people, including a child, a girl. The number of wounded is 17. These are children, women, medical workers,"" Ukraine's Zelensky said in a video address on Thursday. ""This topic was mentioned on Russian TV,"" said Zelensky. ""But not a word of truth was said. The Russians were lied to that there had been no patients in the hospital and no women or children in the maternity hospital. The Russians were lied to that 'nationalists' had allegedly taken up positions there. They lie confidently, as always."" CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the massive airstrike on the hospital in Mariupol shattered a fragile cease-fire in the southern port city of Mariupol late Wednesday afternoon amid efforts to evacuate civilians from the besieged city. Emergency teams and soldiers scrambled to evacuate the wounded, including pregnant women, from the hospital. The blast destroyed the complex inside and out, and the size and depth of the crater and the surrounding debris were clear evidence of its ferocity, D'Agata said. Albania's Ambassador to the United Nations Ferit Hoxha, speaking Thursday to the Security Council, dismissed Russian allegations that the hospital was being used by any armed forces. ""What we saw were women in labor among rubble. We condemn this in the strongest terms. This is a crime which should not remain unpunished and no one should get away with crime,"" Hoxha said according to Falk. Mariupol has come under heavy Russian bombardment for days, cutting off power and water to more than 400,000 people trapped in the city. Ukrainian officials say at least 1,200 civilians have been killed there since the war began, and images have shown city workers placing bodies into a mass grave. Ukrainian officials said at least seven more civilians were killed in further Russian artillery attacks overnight, and the city council said on Thursday that the rocket fire continued, hitting more civilian infrastructure. ""Bombs are hitting houses,"" the council said in a social media post. A video shared on the Telegram social media app by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs and a former member of the Ukraine's parliament, showed what he said were fresh strikes hitting central Mariupol on Thursday. ""Russian occupiers continue to shell residential areas of Mariupol. The maternity and the children's hospitals are not enough for them, they want more victims among the civilians,"" Gerashchenko said in his post. A humanitarian convoy trying to reach Mariupol was forced to turn back on Thursday because of ongoing fighting, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. After his discussion with Lavrov on Thursday, Ukraine's Kuleba said he was prepared to meet his counterpart again to ""continue engagement"" aimed at first establishing a cease-fire and humanitarian corridor for Mariupol, saying the city was at the epicenter of the humanitarian crisis in his country.",47,2.945009943374747,1.7590398247945385,1.1859701185802085,0

The official stressed, however, that this is a difficult number to assess in real time, and the number could be closer to 3,500. Still, the official described the number as ""very, very significant casualties,"" comparing the tally to losses from some World War II battles. The official did not give an estimate for the number of wounded Russians, but the figure in most wars is generally around three times as many killed, which would put that number at an estimated 15,000 to 18,000. Despite the estimated losses, Russian forces are still capable of encircling Kyiv within 1-2 weeks. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers are also believed to have been killed over the past two weeks. The U.S. official said 2,000-4,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed. In the city of Mariupol — where an airstrike hit a maternity hospital on Wednesday — some 1,200 people have died over the course of Russia's nine-day siege of the city, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office said, according to The Associated Press. The AP reported that the city council said Thursday the attack killed three people, including a child, and wounded 17. Russia on Thursday denied that it attacked the maternity hospital, calling the assertion ""fake news,"" according to the Reuters news service. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyanskiy, tweeted that Moscow said Monday that the building had been taken over by Ukrainian troops, who were firing from it. ""That's how fake news is born,"" Polyanskiy tweeted. The Mariupol maternity hospital is one of 18 hospitals and ambulances that have been attacked in Ukraine, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. Those attacks have resulted in at least 10 deaths and 16 injuries, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""These attacks deprive all communities of health care,"" he said, adding that the ""only real solution to the situation is peace."" But despite the strike on the hospital, cease-fires in a handful of major Ukrainian cities appeared to be largely holding Wednesday, allowing civilians to flee neighborhoods that have been pounded for days by Russian artillery. However, those still in the country are struggling to gain access to basic supplies, like water, food and medicine, and facing Russian airstrikes. The U.S. and other Western nations have imposed harsh sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian oligarchs and Russian institutions in response to the invasion. But the Biden administration on Wednesday decided against helping Poland send its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. The U.S. feared that the move could be seen by Russia as escalatory, and did not want to risk sparking a larger war in Europe. A U.S. official on Wednesday told CBS News that Ukraine does not currently need the MiGs, as its anti-aircraft defenses have been effective at keeping Russia from establishing air superiority. The U.S. will continue to send defensive assistance, like anti-tank weapons and air defense, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said during a press briefing Wednesday. Kirby also noted that Ukraine still has ""several squadrons of fully missions capable aircraft."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned Wednesday that everyone should be ""on the lookout"" for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine. In a statement, Psaki said the Biden administration is taking note of what she called Russia's false claims about biological weapons labs in Ukraine. ""This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine,"" Psaki wrote.

One of California's top cybersecurity leaders said the state is preparing in the event of any attacks on systems or infrastructure. Vitaliy Panych, Head of Cyber Security for the California Department of Technology told KPIX 5 that his office has remained focused on preparedness, and that the state remains safe from major attacks. ""Our strategy is really to emphasize a good defense to start, really that focused on prevention, detection, and really if something bad does happen were able to respond quickly and swiftly to minimize the cyber threat,"" Panych said. His perspective on the growing conflict is unique. Panych and his immediate family immigrated from Kyiv to the United States three decades ago. Some extended family remains in the country. Panych said he has been in touch with them and has worried about them and about Ukranians mounting a valiant defense of his birth country. ""Some members of my family are having to hide out in underground bunkers, shelters, to keep themselves safe from any potential physical bombing,"" Panych said. As tensions escalate between the west and Russia, experts concede that retaliatory cyberattacks against the United States are not only possible, but something officials ought to be preparing for. ""The threat is real, were definitely monitoring in case it does spill over with what is going on in Ukraine and the cyber domain and were investing in immense amounts of ability to be able to respond and be ready if something does happen and does affect our nation here on the home front,"" Panych said.

The announcement came as the worst refugee crisis Europe has seen since World War II deepened, with more than 2 million people fleeing Ukraine in recent days into neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.

But while a truce in the northeast Ukrainian city of Sumy appeared to be holding, some people never got the chance to flee. At least 20 people were killed in one strike on the city alone Monday evening, local officials said.

2022-03-09,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elena-branson-charged-illegal-russian-agent-new-york-city/,Russian-American woman charged as illegal Russian agent in New York City,"A woman with Russian and U.S. citizenships who founded what prosecutors called a ""Russian propaganda center"" in New York City was charged Tuesday with subverting laws for the last decade that require foreign agents to register with the U.S. The charges against Elena Branson were announced after the unsealing of a 36-page criminal complaint in Manhattan federal court. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Branson, who left the country for Russia after September 2020 and remains at large, was alleged to have corresponded directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin as he carried out an aggressive propaganda campaign. Williams said in a release that the correspondence with Putin and a high-ranking Russia minister preceded her 2012 founding of the Russian Center New York, which the prosecutor described as a ""Russian propaganda center."" He said her promotional outreach, which occurred while she also served as chairperson of the Russian Community Council of the USA, included an ""I Love Russia"" campaign aimed at American youths. ""All the while, Branson knew she was supposed to register as an agent of the Russian government but chose not to do so and, instead, instructed others regarding how to illegally avoid the same,"" Williams said. ""Particularly given current global events, the need to detect and hinder attempts at foreign influence is of critical importance, and the Southern District of New York is proud to do its part in the fight against tyranny,"" he said. The criminal complaint accused Branson of acting illegally on behalf of the Russian government since at least 2011. It said she started the Russian Center New York after receiving tens of thousands of dollars in funding from the Russian government to do so. Branson, 61, was charged with conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the U.S. attorney general, among other charges. The complaint said her work on behalf of the Russian government included arranging meetings for herself and other Russian officials with U.S. government officials and executives at businesses based in the United States. It said she even tried in April 2016 to invite then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or one of his children to a ""Russia Forum New York,"" although the complaint said there was no sign Trump or his children attended the meeting. The complaint said she emailed a Trump adviser after the November 2016 presidential election to offer congratulations and try to get the president-elect to attend a World Chess Championship in Manhattan, although ""there was no indication that the now-former President attended the referenced event."" At that event on Nov. 10, 2016, Branson was photographed with Putin's current press secretary, the complaint said. In March 2016, it said, she helped arrange meetings for the head of the Department of Foreign Economic Activity and International Relations for the Government of Moscow with, among others, a then-New York state senator and the management of certain U.S. companies. In 2019, authorities said, she coordinated through her New York center a campaign to lobby Hawaiian officials not to change the name of Fort Elizabeth on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, which is the last remaining former Russian fort in the Hawaiian islands. They said she provided Hawaiian officials with messages from Russian government officials and organized a trip to Moscow for Hawaiian officials responsible for the potential name change in order to meet with high-ranking government personnel. According to the complaint, the FBI recovered a card, in which a councilmember appears to have written to thank Branson ""for welcoming the people from Kauai."" The compliant includes an image of the card, which allegedly included a post-it note that reads: ""I am not coming or communicating because I am being watched. It feels wrong for me to be involved that way"" and, on the back of the note: ""It is on the American side."" Authorities said Branson regularly received funding and direction from the Russian government, including from the country's embassy in Washington, and received tasking from high-level Russian government officials and government-run organizations. In a release, authorities said the FBI interviewed Branson on Sept. 29, 2020 and she falsely claimed she had never been asked by Russian officials to coordinate any meetings between U.S. business leaders or politicians and officials from the government of Moscow. The complaint said the FBI during its probe used search warrants to access eight of Branson's electronic accounts and 34 electronic devices, including about 11 cellular phones. It said she flew to Moscow less than a month after her FBI interview, and sold her New York City residence last March. In a Jan. 30, 2012 email, Branson wrote that she was sending a letter to Putin asking him to provide administrative support so she could host events at the Russian Consulate in New York and the Russian Embassy in Washington, the complaint said. According to the complaint, Branson emailed an individual in April 2012 who was working in the New York City mayor's office to thank him for helping her obtain ""statistical data"" to assist her in opening the Russian Center New York. The complaint said she received about $173,000 between August 2013 and November 22, 2019, from Russian government-controlled entities in connection with her work at the center. In October, Branson told a Russian government-controlled television station that she had left the U.S. because she thought the ""probability was very high"" that she would be arrested if she had stayed. In an interview with Russian television last year, Ms Branson said she left the US because she thought the ""probability was very high"" that she would be arrested if she had stayed.

2022-03-08,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-putin-sanctions-ukraine-undeterred/,"Putin unlikely to be deterred by economic sanctions against Russia and military setbacks in Ukraine, U.S. intel leaders say","Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""unlikely to be deterred"" by the effect of the West's coordinated economic sanctions and his military's setbacks in Ukraine and will seek to ""escalate"" his country's aggression against Kyiv in the coming weeks, top U.S. intelligence leaders said Tuesday. An ""aggrieved"" Putin likely ""perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,"" said director of national intelligence Avril Haines, who testified along with other intelligence chiefs before the House Intelligence Community as part of an annual hearing on worldwide threats. She was joined by CIA Director William Burns, FBI director Christopher Wray, Cyber Command Commander and NSA director Gen. Paul Nakasone, and Defense Intelligence Agency director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, who will all appear again for additional testimony before the Senate Intelligence Community on Thursday. Haines said Moscow had encountered ""significantly more resistance"" from Ukraine than it had anticipated, and, while it was unclear if Russia still planned to attempt a takeover of the whole country, that it would be ""especially challenging"" for the Russians to hold and control Ukrainian territory in the face of what would likely be a ""persistent and significant insurgency."" Berrier, who heads the Pentagon's military intelligence arm, said Russia's military had suffered ""somewhere between 2,000-4,000"" casualties - a ""low-confidence"" assessment he said was drawn from intelligence and open sources. Burns, the CIA director, said that Mr. Putin had been for years stewing in a ""combustible combination of grievance and ambition,"" and had embarked on a military invasion based on a number of flawed assumptions – including about the resilience of Ukrainian forces, the robustness of the response from the West, the ability of the Russian economy to weather sanctions, and the strength of his own military. ""He's been proven wrong on every count,"" Burns said, noting the Russian leader's views had in recent years ""hardened"" as he became ""more insulated"" from diverse points of view. Burns added, however, that an ""angry and frustrated"" Putin would likely continue his military's campaign with little regard for the civilian toll it might take, and despite the fact that he had ""no sustainable political end game."" ""He is likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,"" he added, predicting ""an ugly next few weeks."" He also said Chinese president Xi Jinping and other political leaders were ""unsettled"" by events in Ukraine, including how they had driven Europe and the United States closer together. Beijing was also increasingly wary of the potential ""reputational damage"" its close association with Moscow could produce, Burns said. Berrier estimated Ukrainians would only have enough food and water to last ""10 days to two weeks"" once supply lines were cut. ""It will become somewhat desperate,"" he said. Haines said U.S. intelligence agencies were watching ""very closely"" for any movements of Russian strategic and nuclear weapons, acknowledging Putin's decision to put his forces on heightened alert last month was ""highly unusual."" ""We're not seeing something at this stage that he is doing something different than he has been in the past,"" Haines said. ""We do think that he is signaling, that he is attempting to deter,"" she said.

""The Russian military I think is guilty of war crimes. You've seen indiscriminate shelling by artillery and even some unguided missiles going into residential areas,"" said former US Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer. The plan with this ceasefire is to allow those Ukrainians trapped in cities encircled by Russian troops to escape and for desperately needed supplies to come in. ""The first three days of attempts haven't worked out. I hope it does work out. It remains to be seen if the Russians deliver as promised,"" Pifer told KPIX5. The World Health Organization says at least 10 hospitals have also been targeted by Russian shelling. While outnumbered, the Ukrainian military and citizens are knocking out Russian planes and tanks. Pifer says nothing about this invasion has likely gone the way Russian President Vladimir Putin has planned. ""My guess is in the Kremlin that they've been surprised maybe even stunned by the impact of the sanctions, the scale of the sanctions and they probably surprised too how NATO has come together, both in terms of re-inforcing the Eastern flank near Russia as well as the defense assistance and the arms that you see flowing from about 20 countries into Ukraine."" Putin has more than 4,500 nuclear warheads in the Russian arsenal. Dr. Gloria Duffy worked on nuclear disarmament during the Clinton Administration - including getting more than 1700 warheads out of Ukraine and converted to fuel for power plants. ""I am glad that there are fewer nuclear weapons in that region than there were when we started,"" said Dr. Duffy. She worries about what lengths Putin will reach to rebuild the Russian empire. ""This is completely unhinged in my view."" According to the United Nations some 1200 Ukrainian civilians have died in days of Russian bombardment and nearly 1.5 million have fled the country, the largest mass exodus in Europe since World War 2.",47,3.354814606784178,3.4076871168375282,-0.05287251005335003,23

On Day 12 of the invasion, Russia's ground forces were seemingly stalled north of the capital city of Kyiv and making limited progress around other major cities. That slow advance has left Moscow to rely on a barrage of artillery in a bid to pummel Ukrainians into submission.

The move is part of the deployment of 7,000 U.S. military personnel earmarked to support the NATO Response Force. Deploying personnel include those from the 96th Transportation Company (Heavy Equipment Transport), and the 297th Inland Cargo Transfer Company, both from the 13th Expeditionary Sustainment Command; and the 11th Corps Signal Brigade; all of which fall under the III Armored Corps at Fort Hood. These forces will augment U.S. forces in the European theater and are trained and equipped for various missions to reinforce the U.S. European Command posture on NATO's eastern flank, Fort Hood said in a news release. ""Our Soldiers are trained and ready,"" said Col. Matthew Ruedi, the 13th ESC deputy commanding officer. ""Elements of our heavy transportation company have deployed to Europe to reassure NATO allies, deter Russian aggression, and are prepared to support a range of other operations in the region."" Ruedi also said the unit has ensured families were kept in the loop during the process of the unit getting ready to deploy. ""It's not just our Soldiers that we ensure are ready for this mission, but we do everything we can to make sure Families are ready, too,"" Ruedi said. ""Things can change rapidly in situations like this. Making sure we communicate with our families not only helps manage expectations, but it also contributes to our overall readiness.""",4,6.05180924621645,1.9969763725203347,4.054832873696116,22
2022-03-08,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fighter-jets-ukraine-poland-deal/,U.S. working with Poland on deal to send fighter jets to Ukraine,"The war for control of Ukraine will be waged in the air, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told U.S. lawmakers Saturday, and therefore, he implored them to give him planes to keep Russia at bay. The U.S. is urging Poland and other Eastern European countries to give their Russian-made fighter jets to Ukraine and is working on a plan to backfill the planes they give up with U.S.F-16s. One advantage of the Russian planes is that Ukrainian pilots are already trained to fly them. The other reason is that these planes can be deployed far more quickly. One U.S. official said the administration has told Poland it should make Russian-made MiGs in its arsenal available because these planes would not require U.S. permission to be transferred. Conversely, any effort to send newly manufactured planes to Ukraine could be hampered by several years' worth of paperwork with defense contractors. Further, the transfer of American-made F-16 fighter jets from NATO allies would require congressional notification. Because Ukrainian pilots are not trained on American planes, the fighter jets would not be immediately helpful to them, even if they were able to obtain them sooner. Poland has 21 single-seat MiG-29s and 6 twin-seat MiG-29s, according to Janes World Air Forces. Although Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the U.S. would give the go-ahead to the transfer of the planes to Ukraine and is already talking with Poland about backfilling its aircraft inventory, Poland has not yet decided to move ahead with the transfers. In a tweet over the weekend, the chancellery of the Polish prime minister called a story stating that Poland would give Ukraine MiG-29s in exchange for U.S.-made F-16s was ""fake news."" And whether Poland would turn over its entire inventory of these planes — or even whether they're all in working condition — isn't clear yet, either. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that while the U.S. is working with Poland and other NATO allies on this issue, ""this is Poland's sovereign decision to make."" She noted the logistical challenges of physically transferring the planes from Poland to Ukraine. ""Are they going to fly? Where will they depart from? Where will they land? Those are all very important questions here,"" Psaki said during the daily White House press briefing. Psaki also said that there are complicated logistics for backfilling planes for European allies that send jets to Ukraine, ""because procuring new planes and transferring serious weapons systems often take years to do from the United States."" Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Colonel and senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, discussed the source of Poland's hesitation with CBS News. ""That's not a logistical issue. That's a political issue. It's a political issue in the sense that, if you have a Polish aircraft and you put a Ukrainian pilot in there, and that pilot then flies the aircraft into Ukraine to fight the Russians, the Russians can plausibly argue that Poland has now become a co-belligerent, since it's launching aircraft from its soil into Ukraine,"" Cancian said. ""So the Poles are very, very nervous about that and want to be very careful that this does not make them vulnerable to Russian counter-actions."" Ultimately, Cancian believes that Poland will agree to a deal ""for two reasons. One is that there's so much desire to help the Ukrainians. And the second thing is, if Poland can get rid of old Soviet aircraft and get new American F-16s, that's a good deal. They want to do that. Between those two, I think they'll figure something out."" Cancian noted one criticism about this plan is that these aircraft are vulnerable. ""They may not end up making as much difference as we hope. If we fly them into Ukraine and the Russians take them out the next day with long-range missiles, what have we accomplished?"" But he noted that ""at this point, there's also an element of symbolism to it. There is a real capability there, but there's also an element of symbolism."" After Zelensky spoke with Congress, Senators Rob Portman and Jeanne Shaheen sent a letter to President Biden urging him to send American-made aircraft to European allies who supply Ukraine with Soviet-era planes. They identified Poland, Bulgaria and Slovakia as countries having discussions with the U.S.about transferring part of their inventory to the Ukrainian Air Force. The Biden administration has asked that $10 billion in additional support for Ukraine be included in a broad government funding package expected to pass in Congress this week. In a letter on Monday to lawmakers obtained by CBS News, Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova laid out Ukraine's requests for the legislation, which included taking appropriate steps to provide Ukraine with aircraft and defense systems. A U.S. official said Monday that the airspace over Ukraine remains contested, and the Pentagon assesses that the Ukrainians still have a majority of their fixed wing aircraft available. The Ukrainians have stalled the Russians in their advances on key population centers, but as the days go on, the Russians have struck targets with no regard for civilian infrastructure.

Hodges said he foresaw ""lots more destruction and fighting"" in and around Kyiv, but he predicted the capital ""will not fall"" and the ""Russians will not be able to take it."" Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""initial strategy"" when he invaded Ukraine — to quickly storm major cities, oust pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky and replace him with a Russian-friendly alternative — ""has failed,"" said Hodges. He noted that Russia's military had resorted to ""an attrition strategy to bring about the same aim,"" and acknowledged that the steady barrage of rocket fire on Ukraine's cities had ""helped make up for their poor planning, terrible logistics, inability to conduct effective joint operations at the operational level, and their poor estimation of Ukrainian fighting power."" ""But I don't think they can sustain this 'overwhelming' firepower as their logistical challenge worsens and the logistics for Ukraine get better,"" said Hodges. ""I don't think they have the manpower, logistics, or time to conduct this approach effectively."" A senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Monday that nearly 100% of the Russian combat power that had amassed at the Ukrainian border in the weeks leading up to the invasion has now been committed inside the country. The Russians have launched more than 625 missiles in the 11 days of fighting, the official said, and appear to be increasing their use of long-range strikes to supplement or make up for the lack of ground movement and lack of air superiority. Some allied military leaders are likewise indicating that Ukrainian forces and civilians might be able to withstand the Russians' advances. ""I think we've seen a Russian invasion that is not going well. I think we're also seeing a remarkable resistance by Ukraine, both its armed forces and its people,"" Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the chief of the defense staff in the U.K., told BBC News on Sunday. ""We do know that some of the lead elements of Russian forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian response."" Hodges, the retired U.S. commander, said that Putin's adopted tactics could start to increase pressure on the Russian leader not only from other countries, but from within his own. ""The great unknown for me is if the Russian population will continue to support this once they understand what's really going on,"" Hodges said. ""And I'm sure they'll begin to understand it soon, despite Putin's blackout on news/social media.""

2022-03-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-opening-several-civilian-evacuation-corridors/,Russia announces limited ceasefire and opening of several civilian evacuation corridors,"Lviv, Ukraine — Russia announced yet another ceasefire and a handful of humanitarian corridors to enable civilians to flee Ukraine starting Monday, but previous such measures have fallen apart and Moscow's armed forces continued to pummel some Ukrainian cities with rockets even after the announcement. A day earlier, hundreds of thousands of civilians attempting to flee to safety were forced to shelter from what Ukrainian officials said was Russian shelling in cities in the center, north and south. Ahead of a third round of talks planned for Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry said a ceasefire would start in the morning, and safe passages would open for civilians from the capital of Kyiv, the southern port city of Mariupol, and the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. Some of the evacuation routes, however, would funnel civilians toward Russia or its ally Belarus - unlikely destinations for many Ukrainians who would prefer to head toward countries on the western and southern borders. A senior Ukrainian official rejected those proposals. It wasn't immediately clear if fighting would stop beyond the areas mentioned or when the cease-fire would end. Hopes were dim that the latest round of talks would yield any breakthroughs. A Russian task force had said the ceasefire would start Monday morning, the 12th day of the war. Monday's ceasefire announcement follows two failed attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, from which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimated 200,000 people were trying to flee. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for the failure. The Russian task force said Monday's ceasefire and the opening of the corridors was announced at the request of French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday. Russia's defense ministry claimed on Monday that Ukraine was planning to blow up an experimental nuclear reactor at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology and blame it on Russian missiles. The ministry said Ukraine would then accuse the Kremlin of ""creating an ecological catastrophe."" There was no initial reaction form Kyiv to Moscow's assertion. Russia controls two nuclear power plants in Ukraine, including Europe's largest, the Zaporizhzhya plant in Enerhoda, which Ukrainian staffers continue to operate. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Sunday that Russia has shut down some external communication to the plant. It was taken over Friday by Russian forces after shelling led to a fire at one of the training buildings. Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, told ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that the international community should step in and help Ukraine regain control of the nuclear sites from Russia. Markarova noted that the first nuclear plant the Russians seized was the infamous one at Chernobyl, which is ""not operational"" but still poses a risk because ""there is a lot of waste there and everything else."" Monday's ceasefire announcement follows two failed attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, from which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimated 200,000 people were trying to flee. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for the failure. The Russian task force said Monday's ceasefire and the opening of the corridors was announced at the request of French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday. Evacuation routes published by Russia's RIA Novosti news agency, citing the Defense Ministry, show that civilians will be able to leave to Russia and Belarus. Russian forces will be observing the ceasefire with drones, the task force said. The earlier breakdown of evacuations came as Ukraine officials said that Russian shelling intensified across the country. ""Instead of humanitarian corridors, they can only make bloody ones,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday. ""Today a family was killed in Irpin. Man, woman and two children. Right on the road. As in a shooting gallery."" Putin said Moscow's attacks could be halted ""only if Kyiv ceases hostilities."" As he has often done, Putin blamed Ukraine for the war, telling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday that Kyiv needed to stop all hostilities and fulfill ""the well-known demands of Russia."" Putin launched his invasion with a string of false accusations against Kyiv, including that it is led by neo-Nazis intent on undermining Russia with the development of nuclear weapons. As Russian attacks worsened, a brief reprieve from fighting in Mariupol collapsed. Heavy artillery hit residential areas in other large cities, local officials reported. ""There can be no 'green corridors' because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom,"" Ukraine Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram. On what is known as Forgiveness Sunday in Orthodox Christianity, Zelensky said Ukraine will never forgive the shelling of its homes, the killing of unarmed people and the destruction of its infrastructure. ""And God will not forgive, either today or tomorrow - never. And instead of a day of forgiveness, there will be a judgment day. Of this I am sure,"" he said in a video address. The death toll remains unclear. The U.N. says it has confirmed just a few hundred civilian deaths but also warned that the number is a vast undercount. Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich described a ""catastrophic"" situation in the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, where efforts to evacuate residents on Sunday failed. About eight civilians, including a family, were killed by Russian shelling in Irpin, according to Mayor Oleksander Markyshin. Video footage showed a shell slamming into a city street, not far from a bridge used by people fleeing the fighting. A group of fighters could be seen trying to help the family. Arestovich said the government was doing all it could to resume evacuations. ""This is likely to represent an effort to break Ukrainian morale,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said of Russian tactics. Fighting has caused 1.5 million people to flee the country, which the head of the U.N. refugee agency called ""the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II."" British military officials compared Russia's tactics to those Moscow used in Chechnya and Syria, where surrounded cities were pulverized by airstrikes and artillery. Food, water, medicine and almost all other supplies were in desperately short supply in Mariupol, where Russian and Ukrainian forces had agreed to an 11-hour cease-fire that would allow civilians and the wounded to be evacuated. But Russian attacks quickly closed the humanitarian corridor, Ukrainian officials said. The handful of residents who managed to flee the city before the humanitarian corridor closed said the city of 430,000 had been devastated. ""We saw everything: houses burning, all the people sitting in basements,"" said Yelena Zamay, who fled to one of the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists. ""No communication, no water, no gas, no light, no water. There was nothing."" Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Azov. Capturing Mariupol could enable Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that most other countries considered illegal. But much of the Russian advance has become stalled, including an immense military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv. A senior U.S. defense official said Sunday that the U.S. assesses that about 95% of the Russian forces that had been arrayed around Ukraine are now inside the country. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said Russian forces continue to advance in an attempt to isolate Kyiv, Kharkhiv and Chernihiv, but are being met with strong Ukrainian resistance. Ukraine's professional and volunteer fighters have fought with great tenacity, though they are greatly outmatched by the Russian army. Volunteers lined up Saturday in Kyiv to join the military. Ukraine is also planning to fill an international legion with 20,000 volunteers from dozens of countries, though it was not clear how many were in Ukraine. ""The whole world today is on Ukraine's side, not only in words but in deeds,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Ukrainian television Sunday night. The West has broadly backed Ukraine, offering aid and weapon shipments and slapping Russia with vast sanctions. But no NATO troops have been sent to Ukraine. Zelensky has also heaped criticism on Western leaders for not responding with more force to Russia. He reiterated a request for foreign protectors to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which NATO so far has ruled out because of concerns such an action would lead to a far wider war. Zelensky also asked the United States and NATO countries to send more warplanes to Ukraine. But that idea is complicated by questions about how to provide aircraft to Ukrainian pilots. He later urged the West to tighten its sanctions on Russia, saying that ""the audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal"" that existing sanctions are not enough. Russia has become increasingly isolated in the days since the invasion began, closing itself off to outside sources of information as sanctions bite deeply into its economy. The ruble has plunged in value, and dozens of multinational companies ended or dramatically scaled back their work in the country. On Sunday, American Express announced it would suspend operations in Russia, as well as in Russian-allied Belarus. Also, two of the so-called Big Four accounting firms, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, said Sunday they would end their relationships with their Russia-based member firms. TikTok announced Sunday Russian users would not be able to post new videos or see videos shared from elsewhere in the world. The company blamed Moscow's new ""fake news"" law, which makes it illegal, among other things, to describe the fighting as an invasion. Netflix also cut its service to Russia but provided no details. Facebook and Twitter have already been blocked in Russia, along with access to the websites of a number of major international media outlets. TikTok is part of the Chinese tech company ByteDance. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress is exploring how to further isolate Russia from the global economy, including banning the import of its oil and energy products into the United States. Pelosi said in a letter to Democrats released late Sunday that the legislation under consideration would also repeal normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus and begin the process of denying Russia access to the World Trade Organization.",47,2.0522403973771732,3.129575033758705,-1.077334636381532,11

2022-03-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/russia-ukraine-war-evacuations-news-latest-mariupol/,Russian assaults block evacuations of Ukrainian civilians for second time,"Lviv, Ukraine — A second attempt to evacuate civilians from a besieged city in southern Ukraine collapsed Sunday as Russian attacks stopped plans to create a humanitarian corridor, a Ukrainian government official said, and Pope Francis called for an end to the ""rivers of blood and tears"" created by the war. Food, water, medicine and almost all other supplies were in desperately short supply in the port city of Mariupol, where Russian and Ukrainian forces had agreed to a 11-hour cease-fire to allow civilians and the wounded to be evacuated. But Russian attacks quickly closed the corridor, Ukrainian officials said. ""There can be no 'green corridors' because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom,"" Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram. The news dashed hopes that more people could escape the fighting in Ukraine, where Russia's plan to quickly overrun the country has been stymied by fierce resistance. Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine and along the coast, but many of its efforts have become stalled, including an immense military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv. The war, now in its 11th day, has caused 1.5 million people to flee the country. The head of the U.N. refugee agency called the exodus ""the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II."" As he has often done, Russian President Vladimir Putin turned blame for the fighting back on Ukraine, telling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday that the invasion could be halted only ""only if Kyiv ceases hostilities,"" according to a Kremlin statement on the phone call. He said Ukraine had to fulfill ""the well-known demands of Russia,"" which include what he calls the ""demilitarization"" and ""denazification"" of Ukraine. The presidents of Turkey and France, as well as Pope Francis, appealed to Putin to negotiate. In a highly unusual move, the pope said he had dispatched two cardinals to Ukraine, saying the Vatican would do everything it could to end the conflict. ""In Ukraine, rivers of blood and tears are flowing,"" the pontiff said in his traditional Sunday blessing. ""This is not just a military operation, but a war that sows death, destruction and misery."" After the cease-fire in Mariupol failed to hold Saturday, Russian forces intensified their shelling of the city and dropped massive bombs on residential areas of Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said. British military officials compared Russia's tactics to those Moscow used in Chechnya and Syria, where surrounded cities were pulverized by airstrikes and artillery. ""This is likely to represent an effort to break Ukrainian morale,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated a request for foreign protectors to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Putin warned Saturday that Moscow would consider a third-party declaration to close Ukrainian airspace to be a hostile act, and the West so far has rebuffed Zelensky's pleas, fearing a confrontation with Russia. ""The world is strong enough to close our skies,"" Zelensky said in a video address on Sunday. Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelensky, said Ukrainian officials and international humanitarian organizations were working with Russia through intermediaries to establish humanitarian corridors from Bucha and Hostomel, which are Kyiv suburbs where there has been heavy fighting. As Russian forces surrounded several Ukrainian cities, Zelensky appeared on television Saturday night and rallied his people to stay defiant. ""Ukrainians in all of our cities that the enemy has entered — go on the offensive!"" said Zelensky, who was wearing his habitual military green T-shirt. ""You should take to the streets! You should fight! … It is necessary to go out and drive this evil out of our cities, from our land."" The strength of Ukrainian resistance continues to surprise Russian forces, and they have responded by targeting populated areas, including the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in its daily intelligence briefing. The death toll is difficult to measure. The U.N. human rights office said at least 351 civilians have been confirmed killed, but the true number is probably much higher. Ukraine's military is vastly outmatched by Russia's, but its professional and volunteer forces have fought back with fierce tenacity. In Kyiv, volunteers lined up Saturday to join the military. Even in cities that have fallen, there were signs of the resistance Zelensky requested. Onlookers in Chernihiv cheered as they watched a Russian military plane fall from the sky and crash, according to video released by the Ukrainian government. In Kherson, hundreds of protesters waved blue and yellow Ukrainian flags and shouted, ""Go home."" But the struggle to enforce temporary ceasefires in Mariupol and Volnovakha on Saturday showed the fragility of efforts to stop the fighting across Ukraine. A third round of talks between Russia and Ukraine will take place Monday, according to Davyd Arakhamia, a member of the Ukrainian delegation. He gave no additional details, including where they would take place. Previous meetings were held in Belarus. Those talks led to the cease-fire agreement that failed Saturday and was revived Sunday. Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Avrov. Capturing Mariupol could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that most other countries considered illegal. Meanwhile, the head of the Chernihiv region said Russia has dropped powerful bombs on residential areas of the city of the same name, which has a population of 290,000. Vyacheslav Chaus posted a photo online of what he said was an undetonated FAB-500, a 1,100-pound bomb. ""Usually this weapon is used against military-industrial facilities and fortified structures,"" Chaus said. Zelensky sought to rally support from U.S. lawmakers on Saturday, speaking to more than 300 members of Congress via a video link. He pleaded for additional help, specifically fighter planes to help secure the skies over Ukraine, even as he insisted Russia was being defeated. Russian troops were advancing on a third nuclear power plant, Zelensky said. They have already taken control of the Zaporizhzhia plant in Ukraine, as well as Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. President Biden called Zelensky early Sunday, Kyiv time, to discuss Russia sanctions and speeding U.S. assistance to Ukraine.

2022-03-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/dfw/news/russian-attacks-halt-plans-to-evacuate-ukrainian-civilians/,Russian Attacks Halt Plans To Evacuate Ukrainian Civilians,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — A second attempt to evacuate civilians from a besieged city in southern Ukraine collapsed on Mar. 6 during renewed Russian shelling, while Russian President Vladimir Putin shifted blame for the war to Ukraine and said Moscow's invasion could be halted ""only if Kyiv ceases hostilities."" Food, water, medicine and almost all other supplies were in desperately short supply in the port city of Mariupol, where Russian and Ukrainian forces had agreed to an 11-hour cease-fire that would allow civilians and the wounded to be evacuated. But Russian attacks quickly closed the humanitarian corridor, Ukrainian officials said. ""There can be no 'green corridors' because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom,"" Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram. The news dashed hopes that more people could escape the fighting in Ukraine, where Russia's plan to quickly overrun the country has been stymied by fierce resistance. Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine and along the coast, but many of its efforts have become stalled, including an immense military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv. Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy rallied his people to remain defiant, especially those in cities occupied by Russians. ""You should take to the streets! You should fight!"" he said Saturday on Ukrainian television. ""It is necessary to go out and drive this evil out of our cities, from our land."" Zelenskyy also asked the United States and NATO countries to send more warplanes to Ukraine, though that idea is complicated by questions about which countries would provide the aircraft and how those countries would replace the planes. He later urged the West to tighten its sanctions on Russia, saying that ""the audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal"" that existing sanctions are not enough. The war, now in its 11th day, has caused 1.5 million people to flee the country. The head of the U.N. refugee agency called the exodus ""the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II."" As he has often done, Putin blamed Ukraine for the war, telling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday that Kyiv needed to stop all hostilities and fulfill ""the well-known demands of Russia."" Putin launched his invasion with a string of false accusations against Kyiv, including that it is led by neo-Nazis intent on undermining Russia with the development of nuclear weapons. The Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday announced that its forces intend to strike Ukraine's military-industrial complex with what it said were precision weapons. A ministry spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, claimed in a statement carried by the state news agency Tass that Ukrainian personnel were being forced to repair damaged military equipment so that it could be sent back into action. Zelenskyy criticized Western leaders for not responding to Russia's latest threat. ""I didn't hear even a single world leader react to this,"" Zelenskyy said Sunday evening. ""The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the West that the sanctions imposed on Russia are not sufficient."" Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke about the nuclear situation in Ukraine, which has 15 nuclear reactors at four power plants and was the scene of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The men agreed in principle to a ""dialogue"" involving Russia, Ukraine and the U.N.'s atomic watchdog, according to a French official who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with the presidency's practices. Potential talks on the issue are to be organized in the coming days, he said. Putin also blamed the fire last week at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which Ukrainian officials said was caused by Russian attackers, on a ""provocation organized by Ukrainian radicals."" ""Attempts to shift responsibility for this incident onto the Russian military are part of a cynical propaganda campaign,"" he said, according to the French official. International leaders, as well as Pope Francis, appealed to Putin to negotiate. In a highly unusual move, the pope said he had dispatched two cardinals to Ukraine to try to end the conflict. ""In Ukraine, rivers of blood and tears are flowing,"" the pontiff said in his traditional Sunday blessing. After the cease-fire in Mariupol failed to hold Saturday, Russian forces intensified their shelling of the city and dropped massive bombs on residential areas of Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said. About eight civilians were killed by Russian shelling in the town of Irpin, on the northwest outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mayor Oleksander Markyshin. The dead included a family. Video footage showed a shell slamming into a city street, not far from a bridge used by people fleeing the fighting. A group of fighters could be seen trying to help the family. The handful of residents who managed to flee Mariupol before the humanitarian corridor closed said the city of 430,000 had been devastated. ""We saw everything: houses burning, all the people sitting in basements,"" said Yelena Zamay, who fled to one of the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists. ""No communication, no water, no gas, no light, no water. There was nothing."" British military officials compared Russia's tactics to those Moscow used in Chechnya and Syria, where surrounded cities were pulverized by airstrikes and artillery. ""This is likely to represent an effort to break Ukrainian morale,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said. Zelenskyy reiterated a request for foreign protectors to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which NATO so far has ruled out because of concerns such an action would lead to a far wider war. ""The world is strong enough to close our skies,"" Zelenskyy said Sunday in a video address. The day before, Zelenskyy pleaded with American lawmakers in a video call to help get more warplanes to Ukraine. U.S. officials say Washington is discussing ways to get the planes to Ukraine in a complex scenario that would include sending American-made F-16s to former Soviet bloc nations, particularly Poland, that are now members of NATO. Those countries would then send Ukraine their own Soviet-era MiGs, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly. But because of production backlogs on the U.S. warplanes, the Eastern European nations would essentially have to give their MiGs to the Ukrainians and accept U.S. promises that they would get F-16s as soon as that was possible. Adding to the difficulties is the fact that the next shipment of F-16s is destined for Taiwan, and the U.S. Congress would be reluctant to delay those deliveries. The Russian military has warned Ukraine's neighbors against hosting its warplanes, saying that Moscow may consider those counties part of the conflict if Ukrainian aircraft fly combat missions from their territory. The death toll remains lost in the fog of war. The U.N. says it has confirmed just a few hundred civilian deaths but also warned that the number is a vast undercount. Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said Ukrainian officials and international humanitarian organizations were working with Russia through intermediaries to establish humanitarian corridors from Bucha and Hostomel, which are Kyiv suburbs where there has been heavy fighting. Ukraine's military is greatly outmatched by Russia's, but its professional and volunteer forces have fought back with fierce tenacity. In Kyiv, volunteers lined up Saturday to join the military. Even in cities that have fallen, there were signs of resistance. Onlookers in Chernihiv cheered as they watched a Russian military plane fall from the sky and crash, according to video released by the Ukrainian government. In Kherson, hundreds of protesters waved blue and yellow Ukrainian flags and shouted, ""Go home."" Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Azov. Capturing Mariupol could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that most other countries considered illegal. The West has broadly backed Ukraine, offering aid and weapon shipments and slapping Russia with vast sanctions. But no NATO troops have been sent to Ukraine, leaving Ukrainians to fight Russian troops alone. Russia has become increasingly isolated in the days since the invasion began, closing itself off to outside sources of information as sanctions bite deeply into its economy. The ruble has plunged in value, and dozens of multinational companies ended or dramatically scaled back their work in the country. On Sunday, American Express announced it would suspend operations in Russia, as well as in Russian-allied Belarus. A few hours later, TikTok said Russian users would not be able to post new videos or see videos shared from elsewhere in the world. The company blamed Moscow's new ""fake news"" law, which makes it illegal, among other things, to describe the fighting as an invasion. Netflix also cut its service to Russia but provided no details. Facebook and Twitter have already been blocked in Russia, along with access to the websites of a number of major international media outlets. TikTok is part of the Chinese tech company ByteDance.

2022-03-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-bearing-down-on-second-week/,Russian Invasion Of Ukraine Bearing Down On Second Week,"LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - The Russian Invasion of Ukraine is bearing down on its second week as fighting rages across the country, destroying cities, neighborhoods and claiming lives in the process. Chilling new video has emerged from inside the control room of Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine while it was under attack from the Russian military. Over the public address system, workers frantically called out, ""Stop shooting immediately. You threaten the security of the whole world."" Outside, a fire raged, and video of the aftermath showed the damage, including what looked like shell casings. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack ""terror on an unprecedented level,"" and added that Russian tanks knew what they were firing at and directly aimed at the station. U.S. officials said that the world only narrowly avoided a nuclear catastrophe. Late Friday night, a massive explosion came in Chernihiv, which is north of the capital city of Kyiv. Many residential areas have been also been leveled after days of Russian shelling. In the southern port city of Mariupol, paramedics scrambled to save the lives of civilian victims caught up in the days of heavy fighting. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, accused Russian military of using banned weapons. ""We have seen the use of cluster bombs, which would be in violation of international law,"" Stoltenberg said. Aid groups from Southern California are also on the ground in Ukraine trying to help. Margaret Traub is with International Medical Corps, which is based in LA. ""The situation inside Ukraine is incredibly dire,"" she said. Traub's organization has a team of medical professionals, like doctors, nurses and psychiatrists, doing what they can to help in the war torn country. ""I think the random, indiscriminate bombings that people are seeing, where our own staff in Ukraine -- we had about 30 staff in Ukraine before the hostilities broke out -- and so these are people who are Ukrainian. These are people who are doing this work, but also have their own families to worry about and they are on the move and it's hard for us to be in touch with them. Communications are down, and so it's really frightening for them,"" she said of the situation. In Russia, Vladimir Putin is trying to hide the atrocities committed by the Russian military. The free media inside Russia has been mostly shut down. Facebook, Twitter and networks like CBS, CNN and the BBC have all stopped broadcasting. Putin's government is threatening to jail journalists who report on what Putin calls ""fake"" news about the invasion. In other words, journalists will be punished for telling the truth. Burbank Congressman and Chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff weighed on Putin's effort to spread misinformation. ""Putin is pushing out this lie that there's a genocide against Ukrainians by Ukrainians. It's absurd, and I think it shows why Putin is trying to shut down independent journalism in Russia. He doesn't want his people to learn the truth, but I think they are learning truth and they're certainly going to feel the economic impacts of Putin's folly."" The Russian military is even targeting journalists in Ukraine. A Sky News crew was ambushed outside of Kyiv, with dozen of bullets tearing through their vehicle and hitting the network's correspondent, though he survived.",47,2.5938114306194553,1.9488928494294637,0.6449185811899916,21

On Saturday, the rally was held at Bayfront Park. The demonstrators were holding signs, carrying Ukrainian flags as they chanted against the war. Local elected officials were also at the rally, including Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and Miami Commissioner Joe Carollo. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Russian forces had intensified their shelling in the port city of Mariupol. ""The city is in a very, very difficult state of siege,"" Vadym Boychenko, mayor of the city of Mariupol in Donetsk, told Ukrainian TV. ""Relentless shelling of residential blocks is ongoing, airplanes have been dropping bombs on residential areas."" Boychenko said that thousands of children, women and the elderly came under fire as they arrived in the morning for a possible evacuation through a safe passage corridor. Russia promised to stop the shelling of Mariupol, a port city of 430,000, and Volnovakha, a city in the east, but violated the cease-fire. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyyhas made a ""desperate"" plea to American lawmakers for the US to help get more warplanes to his military and cut off Russian oil imports as Kyiv tries to stave off the Russian invasion. Zelenskyy spoke with some 300 members of Congress and their staffs in an hour-long private video call on Saturday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said afterward that Zelenskyy wants the U.S. to facilitate the transfer of planes from Eastern European allies so Ukraine's military can protect its skies from Russian attack. Since the start of the invasion, 1.45 million people have fled the battered country, according to the U.N.-affiliated Organization for Migration in Geneva. The United Nations has predicted that the total number of refugees could swell to 4 million, to become the biggest such crisis this century. The U.N. Security Council will hold a meeting Monday afternoon on the escalating humanitarian needs that have arisen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. (© Copyright 2022 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Both sides agreed Russian forces control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine, but both blamed the other for the fire. Ukrainian authorities said Russian shelling sparked the blaze. At first they said Russian forces were keeping firefighters from reaching the flames but later said the Russians had relented. According to the Reuters news service, the Kremlin blamed Ukrainian saboteurs and called the fire a ""monstrous provocation."" No increases in radiation levels were detected and plant personnel were monitoring its operations, Ukrainian officials said. Russia's defense ministry said the plant was operating normally. In a video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of using ""nuclear terror."" ""No country has ever shot at nuclear blocks except for Russia,"" Zelensky said. ""First time ever. For the first time ever in our history, in the history of human kind, the terrorist country has reverted to nuclear terror."" During earlier televised comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin said operations in Ukraine were going according to plan despite international criticism over the targeting of highly populated residential areas.

2022-03-04,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cyber-reporting-bill-cisa-white-house-support/,White House backs bill requiring mandatory cyber reporting to CISA amid Ukraine crisis,"The White House has come out in full support of a bill requiring hospitals, power plants, water utilities, airports and other critical infrastructure to report cyber attacks to the Department of Homeland Security within 72 hours. The move comes amid the escalating war in Ukraine and concerns of possible Russian cyber threats to the U.S. In a statement confirming the White House's support, a spokesperson said the legislation is ""a part of the Administration's comprehensive effort to modernizing America's cyber defenses and complements the President's efforts to improve cybersecurity."" The White House underscored that the bill will ""ensure the Federal government rapidly receives information about cyber incidents affecting critical infrastructure which provide the essential services on which Americans rely,"" enabling the government to ""better investigate, mitigate, and further prevent cyber-attacks."" Yet in their statement, the White House left the door open to future changes, indicating it ""remains committed to working with the House, and exploring all options, to ensure that the legislation enables all relevant Federal agencies to receive and process these incident reports as quickly as possible to carry out their cybersecurity missions."" The statement came after top Justice Department officials claimed that failing to include the FBI in a bill requiring infrastructure companies to tell the government when they are hacked makes the country less safe, clashing with decisions made by Democrat-led committees. That criticism has taken lawmakers and congressional staffers by surprise, after the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee worked alongside the FBI and Department of Justice in crafting cyber incident reporting legislation for months, according to Senate committee aides. The bill passed with rare unanimous support in the Senate on Tuesday, just 24 hours after the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas urged lawmakers to act fast amid an escalating Ukraine-Russia crisis, as cyber threats loom over the U.S. homeland. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the bill ""as drafted leaves one of our best tools, the FBI, on the sidelines and makes us less safe at a time when we face unprecedented threats,"" and added the bill could be a ""game changer"" with the right changes. ""I applaud the momentum we're seeing toward mandatory breach reporting, but the current, well-intentioned bill has some serious flaws,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. ""In its current form, it would make the public less safe from cyber threats – slowing aid to victims, hampering identification of other companies the same attackers are targeting, and undercutting disruption operations against cyber threats."" Politico was the first to report on the Department of Justice and FBI's criticism of the bill. Congress has been working on the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act for the better part of a year. Senate aides made more than a dozen changes to address the concerns of the FBI and DOJ in recent weeks. After FBI officials first objected to an earlier iteration of the bill in November, lawmakers added language that requires the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to share incident reports with other agencies ""as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours"" after receiving them. Legislators also added a subsection to the bill granting the president – or a designee, such as the National Cyber Director – the power to set a deadline shorter than 24 hours. According to a Senate aide, that loophole could allow the FBI to receive contemporaneous access to all reports received by CISA, if greenlit by the White House. In response to a request by the FBI and DOJ, committee members also mandated consultation with the agencies during the rulemaking process. Despite the concessions, the committee received a second round of DOJ and FBI requested changes on Wednesday, following passage of the bill on Tuesday. ""This is the direction Congress wants to go,"" a Senate committee aide told CBS News. ""These guys are undermining national security over a bureaucratic turf war,"" the aide added, in reference to the FBI and DOJ. The FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department all see the legislation as critical in fighting back against cyber attacks. The DOJ and FBI want changes to ensure both DHS and the FBI are notified, not just DHS. The agencies also want to give businesses protection from their records being discovered through the Freedom of Information Act, which allows members of the public to request records. U.S. officials advocating for the changes proposed by the DOJ and FBI, tell CBS News they view them as relatively minor. But at public hearings and behind closed doors, critical infrastructure operators and lawmakers alike have expressed confusion over where incidents should be reported in the case of a major cyber breach. Notably, in May 2021, acting Director of CISA, Brandon Wales, told Senator Rob Portman of Ohio during a public hearing that CISA was notified of the Colonial Pipeline breach only after the FBI brought them into the investigation. Tuesday's passage of the cyber incident reporting bill by the Senate marks a long awaited victory following several setbacks and is championed by Homeland Security Committee Chair Gary Peters of Michigan and Portman. On Monday night, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appeared before lawmakers at the classified all-Senators briefing on the ongoing Ukraine-Russia crisis. Pressed about what Congress could do to support the federal government's ongoing efforts to safeguard the homeland, Mayorkas urged senators to pass the cyber incident reporting bill, as businesses and organizations ready themselves for the possibility of Russian cyber aggression or retaliation. The Department of Justice and FBI's statements came as a shock to lawmakers and congressional aides following months of deliberations and amid a heightened cyber threat environment. ""The suggestion that passing the first requirement to report cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure would make us less safe is completely false,"" said Jay Bhargava, a spokesperson for Chairman Peters in a statement to reporters. ""The requirement created in this bill will – for the first time ever – ensure that the federal government is getting timely information about substantial cyber-attacks so that they can take swift action to mitigate the damage and prevent ripple effects that threaten our national and economic security. ""The FBI and DOJ were consulted for months, changes were made to the bill to address their concerns – and 100 Senators came together and passed this bill unanimously to move forward with the most significant update to American cybersecurity defenses in our nation's history,"" Bhargava added. Kylie Nolan, a spokesperson for Portman, told CBS News the bill ""reflects changes from DOJ and FBI as well as many others to obtain the broad support it currently enjoys across government and the private sector."" Nolan called protests issued by the Justice Department and FBI ""shameful,"" noting they ""are out of sync with the rest of the country including, it seems, the Biden administration that they work for."" The FBI and Justice Department had expressed their discontent with the cyber reporting mandate to CISA before the Oversight Committee. In November, Bryan Vorndran, head of the FBI's Cyber Division said the agency was ""troubled"" that cyber incident reporting legislation ""does not explicitly account for the essential role that federal law enforcement, and notably the Department of Justice and the FBI, plays in receiving cyber incident reporting and actioning the information to assist victims and impose risk and consequences on cybercriminals."" Despite the ongoing debate, the bill is likely to be greenlit by the House and pass into law. A spokesperson for House Homeland Security Committee chair Bennie Thompson told CBS News in a statement, ""We take issue with how the DOJ and FBI are characterizing the bipartisan, bicameral agreement on cyber incident reporting."" ""The legislation would ensure that the federal government has timely access to information regarding cyber incidents to help identify malicious cyber campaigns early and enhance situational awareness within the government and private sector in a way that protects privacy, civil rights, or civil liberties,"" the spokesperson added. Congressman Andrew Garbarino, ranking member of the House homeland cybersecurity, infrastructure protection and innovation subcommittee, said that pending legislation to address cyber incident reporting ""has been in the works for close to a year with many opportunities to field concerns from public and private sector stakeholders."" ""As the lead federal civilian cybersecurity agency, CISA is best equipped to collect incident reporting data and share with the appropriate federal partners in a manner that will prevent cascading impacts across all 16 U.S. critical infrastructure sectors,"" he added. ""I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill across the finish line as soon as possible. We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines as the cyber threat landscape grows increasingly complex with threats from Russia and other foreign adversaries."" DHS' under secretary for policy Rob Silvers has repeatedly called cyber incident reporting the Biden administration's ""top legislative priority in cybersecurity for 2022.""",20,5.661216179206021,4.839771320905465,0.8214448583005565,16

Tens of thousands more have been displaced but remain inside Ukraine, including one mother and her three children who finally reached safety in the city of Lviv — more than 600 miles west of their home. Kateryna Stoyanova traveled to Lviv from Zaporizhzhia, where she said the Russian army was fast approaching. When they got ""really close,"" she said, they got on a train and left. ""The air raid sirens were permanently on and people were told to go to shelters,"" she told Reuters. ""For a few days me and my kids kept on going down to the shelters — I do not know how many times."" But making the decision to leave wasn't easy as many in Zaporizhzhia had decided to stay behind. ""Some people stay, wait for this to end,"" Stoyanova said. But she felt she couldn't risk it with her children. ""It has been going for eight years and I have no idea how long it will last,"" she said of the war that simmered in Ukraine's Donbas region after Putin's last invasion in 2014, before it erupted into a full-scale conflict with his latest assault a week ago. ""One would like it to end, but there is simply no end to it."" Women and children from all over the country have gathered in makeshift shelters in Lviv. Yana Balytska traveled there from Vyshneve, near the capital Kyiv. Russian forces are poised between 20 and 40 miles north of Kyiv, and the U.S. has warned they could move to surround it within a week, but like many of the country's major cities, it has already suffered major damage from shelling. ""We left because of the shooting. They were not shooting in our town, but Kyiv was under fire and areas nearby,"" Balytska told Reuters. ""Yesterday we were standing on a platform waiting for the commuter train and literally over my head, flew the missile that hit the TV tower.""

2022-03-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/cyberattacks-spark-cybersecurity-concerns-among-maryland-lawmakers/,Cyberattacks Prompt Maryland Lawmakers To Craft Security Bills,"BALTIMORE (WJZ) -- Maryland's House Speaker launched a push for a package of cybersecurity bills she says are critical. ""Vulnerabilities in our information technology systems will continue to cost our taxpayers, and that cost is high,"" Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Baltimore County Democrat, said. Recent cyberattacks have cost millions—an estimated more than $8 million dollars after Baltimore County Schools were hacked in 2020. Baltimore City paid out $6 million after hackers took over the city's systems that controlled everything from water bills to real estate fees in 2019. Last December, hackers demanded a ransom from the Maryland Department of Health. The attack stopped reporting of crucial COVID data as the Omicron variant was rapidly spreading. And in February, the Twitter account of Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby was hacked. ""As we rely more heavily on technology, it means more cyberattacks, particularly those targeting state and local governments,"" Jones said. The bills making their way through Maryland's General Assembly would improve cybersecurity training, statewide coordination, regular assessments of threats and hire an independent contractor to scour systems for security risks. You can read more about them here:   ""We are past day zero. We have already been attacked at the state level, at the local level,"" said Delegate Pat Young, who is sponsoring the legislation, of the urgency. The head of information technology in Montgomery County revealed there are attacks on their systems a staggering 15 million times each day. The cybersecurity push comes amid warnings Russia could target businesses and government agencies in the United States as retaliation over sanctions for its war with Ukraine. ""As the sanctions continue to lay waste to the Russian economy, it may become an economic necessity to bring money back into Russia,"" CBS News cybersecurity expert Chris Krebs said.",20,4.4535534718509675,4.726298364403117,-0.27274489255214984,6
2022-03-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine-dwindling-options-isolation/,Putin's dwindling options and isolation fuel fears about his next moves,"Washington — Western officials are warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin could resort to increasingly brutal and extreme tactics in Ukraine as Russian forces struggle to achieve their military objectives and questions arise about Putin's grip on power. A senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Wednesday that Russian forces advancing toward Kyiv ""appear to be stalled"" and were suffering overall from ""logistical and sustainment problems as well as integration problems."" ""The Russians will learn from these missteps and try to overcome them,"" the official said. President Biden said Wednesday that the Russian leader was ""isolated from the world more than ever,"" as a raft of sanctions destabilizes the Russian economy and Moscow's invasion is met with near-global condemnation. Observers of the Kremlin have noted that Putin, a former intelligence officer previously known for his restraint, has appeared uncharacteristically agitated, delivering meandering screeds and publicly lashing out at his aides. ""He was always cold, calculating and ruthless. You know, a KGB man through and through,"" said Mike Vickers, a former undersecretary of defense for intelligence, special operations officer and CIA officer who played an instrumental part in arming the Afghan insurgency during the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s. ""But he's now more emotional, more erratic, more rambling, I think more reckless, perhaps from increasing self-isolation and confidence in himself."" ""This looks like a major strategic blunder that the potential losses way outweigh the gains,"" Vickers added during a recent episode of CBS News' ""Intelligence Matters"" podcast. ""And so I think in that sense, he really is a different man now, and therefore potentially more dangerous."" Current and former officials and people briefed on U.S. intelligence say agencies have assessed that Putin is an experienced, calculating and rational actor with a distinct worldview, but who has in recent years — and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic — become more isolated and unpredictable, relying on a dwindling circle of advisers and aides. Sources who spoke with CBS News were not aware of credible information that Putin, apart from being nearly 70 years old, is physically ailing or suffering from neurological issues that would leave him detached from reality. U.S. policymakers are asking for fresh insights into his thinking from the CIA and other agencies, where leadership analysts are tasked full-time with profiling world leaders like Putin and other decision-makers in foreign governments. Their roles involve combining and analyzing different types of collected intelligence — information obtained from human sources, intercepted communications, and via other means — to determine leaders' motivations and their potential vulnerabilities. Some Western officials have argued that Putin, while less restrained, has for decades made no secret of his agenda, motivations or frustrations. ""I think there's been a logical, methodical plan that goes back a very long way, at least to 2007 when he put the world, and certainly Europe, on notice that Moscow would not accept the further expansion of NATO,"" Fiona Hill, a longtime Russia expert and former National Security Council official, recently told Politico Magazine. Former Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who now serves as a member of the European Parliament, compared the current situation to the years leading up to World War II. ""Identical to the 1930s ... the leader of a major nation-state was telling us publicly that he has a plan of conquest. And our mistake was to think, 'This is too nuts; he can't possibly mean it.' Both of them did mean it,"" Sikorski told CBS News in a recent interview. ""[Putin] wants to undo the collapse of the Soviet Union, and he's been clear about that,"" he added. The French news agency AFP quoted an anonymous official in French President Emmanuel Macron's office as saying that Putin is now ""more rigid and isolated"" than he has been in the past. ""The Putin that [Macron] met at the Kremlin was not the same that he had seen in December 2019,"" the official said, referring to Macron's February meeting with Putin at the Kremlin. Concerns that Russia may soon employ prohibited weapons such as cluster munitions or thermobaric ""vacuum"" bombs have risen as unverified videos circulate on social media of their positioning on Ukrainian soil. The International Criminal Court said Wednesday it would open an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine, after 38 nations signed onto a referral for an expedited inquiry. Speaking in Vienna, Michael Carpenter, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said in a speech on Thursday that the U.S. had credible information the Russians were keeping lists of Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation. ""Given what we have seen in past Russian operations, we expect that the Russian Federation will try to force the population to cooperate through intimidation, abuse, and repression—including through targeted killings, kidnappings, detentions, and physical abuse,"" he said.

2022-03-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-cyberattack-chris-krebs/,"Ukraine war sanctions could spur Russian cyberattacks on U.S., expert warns","As Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine last week, military and security experts anticipated both conventional warfare attacks — missiles, bombs, gunfire — and devastating cyber strikes targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure as well as digital networks in allied countries. Indeed, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a ""shields up"" alert well ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 23, warning IT departments everywhere to monitor for suspicious activity that could disrupt their business or government operations. The technology consulting firm Wedbush affirmed the alert and issued a report warning U.S. financial institutions, enterprise data centers and logistics companies to prepare for Russia-directed cyberattacks. Aside from a handful of denial of service attacks and wiper malware that deletes data, the Kremlin's formidable hacker army has remained relatively quiet since the invasion. But don't expect Russian restraint to last, said Chris Krebs, partner at the Krebs Stamos Group and former head of CISA. As the West's economic sanctions intensify and damage Russia's economy, Krebs explained, ""you may see retaliation where the Russian government says, 'Hey, you're hitting our banks, so we're gonna go hit your banks.' It could be different techniques or even different actors, outside of official agencies"" like ransomware gangs. CBS MoneyWatch spoke with Krebs, who said Russian cyberattacks are not limited to Ukraine. ""The internet has collapsed the spaces between us. So even though Ukraine seems very far away, every company should be on high alert."" The interview below has been edited for clarity and brevity. How might Russia target the U.S. with cyberattacks? Chris Krebs: It's important to start off with the fact that there is no specific intelligence, as far as I know, to indicate any sort of attack is imminent. They're basing these advisories on a historic understanding of Russian cyber activity targeting the West. In Ukraine, they've gone after the power grid. In 2015 and 2016, the Russians disabled the electric grid in the dead of winter. Russia has also used other techniques, including using software supply-chain attacks. For example, the Russians were able to exploit accounting software and tunnel their way into global businesses. There's a lot of talk about 'cyberwar' right now. How real is this threat? I think there's been a lot of mythology built up around a Cyber Pearl Harbor and a Cyber 9/11, trying to evoke images of exploding pipelines and buildings. At this point in the Russia and Ukraine conflict, cyber as a military capability is obviously nowhere near the kinetic world with bombs. Cyber's not killing people right now. I think we need to step back, maybe take a deep breath about how severe and significant the threat is. There's no question that there's a risk, there's a threat. But obviously on the order of missiles and fighter jets and things like that, cyber is nowhere near that level. But speaking to the broader attack surface — whether it's your phones, your computers, your servers, cloud-based software — those are things that a bad guy could exploit. That could mean stealing sensitive data including intellectual property, and it could mean locking up a network with ransomware. The United States is a leading technology innovator, globally. And as a result, we are at the very tip of the spear in terms of connecting devices to the internet. I hear a lot of questions about how vulnerable we are. You know, everyone has some degree of exposure. I think the important question we have to ask is ""how resilient are we?"" Realistically, it's all about doing the best you can on the prevention and the protection side, but understand that everyone has bad days. Importantly, how quickly can you spot, isolate and respond to security incidents? Can you continue to operate and perform critical functions? It's not about stopping every single threat. There are reports by CBS News, the Associate Press and other news agencies that Russia has launched propaganda campaigns across social media. How resilient are U.S. social networks to disinformation? I recognize some of the efforts of the social media platforms — Facebook, Twitter — that have increased their monitoring to identify campaigns and inauthentic behavior. This includes both covert, meaning they're attempting to look like someone else, and overt, where you have state media that posts information that's false. So, U.S. social networks have done a great job so far: Facebook last week announced they had identified covert activity where hackers based out of Belarus were trying to compromise government officials and journalist accounts in Ukraine, then take over those accounts and post fake videos and fake news of Ukrainian soldiers. So that's an example of these techniques being in play. And you have another aspect, where the social media platforms are taking actions to reduce the viewership of RT and Sputnik, which are the two of the well-known, state-sponsored media outlets from Russia. Microsoft President Brad Smith last week announced steps that included de-ranking or delisting state media in Bing search results. These are important steps that technology firms can take. What lessons should business and government agencies learn from this moment of heightened cyber activity? Let's be perfectly clear: We are in uncharted territories. This is not a business-as-usual situation. I'm not sure that there are many companies that have well developed playbooks for an event of such geopolitical gravity as we're seeing right now. You're seeing consumer brands really responding. Formula 1 canceled its Russian circuit. FIFA suspended Russia from World Cup participation in 2022. Same with Russia and Eurovision, the popular music show. In terms of the hard infrastructure, security researchers and what I call ethical hackers are mapping out Russian supply-chain connections. If anyone is profiteering off war, they're going to get called out. Business leaders should really be thinking long and hard about if you have any connectivity, what sort of engagement you have with Russia. I think the real responsible corporate leaders are making a move in support of Ukraine now, because history's going to judge all of us, one way or another. You want to be on the right side of history here. What does the future of cyber conflict look like? As Thomas Friedman says, the world is flat. The internet has collapsed the spaces between us. So even though Ukraine seems very far away, every company should be on high alert. We're connecting with the citizens of Ukraine on a very personal level. And so we need to be careful that we're also not falling prey to some of the disinformation that's flowing around. It's not just the government agencies and it's not just the large companies that are potential targets of bad cyber actors. I think it's entirely possible that as the sanctions continue to ratchet down on the Russian economy, that you could see ransomware actors lash out in retaliation. There have been some indications that one group in particular said that if you attack us, Russia, we're going to respond; we're going to go after your critical infrastructure. The challenge here is that the actors are not necessarily strategic. They're not necessarily going after just the people with money, or the organizations with money. They're opportunistic. And so, whether it's someone in New York City or it's someone in Omaha, Nebraska, if you're connected to the internet there is a degree of risk exposure.",20,5.346184385215997,2.1127798359768812,3.2334045492391157,24
2022-03-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/what-would-a-cyberattack-on-the-u-s-look-like/,What Would A Cyberattack On The U.S. Look Like?,"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) - As war rages on in Ukraine, concerns that the U.S. could come under attack are rising. The battlefield however would be online. Chaos continues on the ground in Ukraine this week after a missile strike targeted a TV tower. Explosive weaponry isn't the only way Russia is fighting its neighbor, though. The Kremlin has targeted banks and energy sectors digitally. ""I'm not surprised that a portion of this war is being fought in a cyber-battlefield,"" said Mark Lanterman, chief technology officer for Computer Forensic Services. What would a cyberattack on the U.S. look like? ""What we need to be concerned about is cyberattacks against our power grid, against our water processing plants, against our hospitals, our banks, news media,"" Lanterman said. All of that critical infrastructure is connected to networks and could be vulnerable. It happened in 2021 when Russians hacked the Colonial Pipeline, creating a brief gas shortage in the southeast that had drivers scrambling to fill up while also grounding flights. ""What that taught us is that there is no such thing as perfect security, and we can't be so arrogant as to think it won't happen to us,"" Lanterman said. Xcel Energy tells WCCO it is closely monitoring potential threats to its grid connected to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and that protecting its system from cyber and physical attacks is a top priority. How can the average person prepare for a cyberattack? ""We have to take responsibility for our own security,"" Lanterman said. Here's a few tips he shared to better secure your private information online: - Have a unique username or password for all websites that require one. - Disable location services and Bluetooth on your phone or laptop when not needed. - Regularly update your phone and computer. - Think before your click. ""All it takes is a hacker to trick a business owner into clicking on a link in an email, downloading ransomware, encrypting all of that business' data,"" Lanterman said. ""It's gonna spread throughout the network."" Another idea is to avoid using public Wi-Fi. Lanterman said cyberattacks have occurred on public Wi-Fi networks at coffee shops and libraries. He suggests using your mobile hotspot on your phone in those locations. Late last month, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned businesses and organizations to prepare for potential cyberattacks. CISA at the time said there was no specific, credible threat, however it wants them to be prepared. It advised them to enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching users, update software, and to have antivirus/antimalware software conduct regular scans.",20,3.3354692837514808,4.319984076690232,-0.984514792938751,16

Prosecutor Karim Khan said in a statement that the investigation will look at alleged crimes committed before the Russian invasion, but added that ""given the expansion of the conflict in recent days, it is my intention that this investigation will also encompass any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of my office that are committed by any party to the conflict on any part of the territory of Ukraine."" The court already has conducted a preliminary probe into crimes linked to the violent suppression of pro-European protests in Kyiv in 2013-2014 by a pro-Russian Ukrainian administration and allegations of crimes in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where Russia has backed rebels since 2014. In December 2020, then-ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said the probe uncovered indications that ""a broad range of conduct constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity within the jurisdiction of the Court have been committed"" in Ukraine. However, the court's prosecutors had not yet sought permission from judges to open a full-scale investigation. Khan says he now wants to open the investigation envisaged by his predecessor and broaden it to include crimes committed in fighting since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last week. Khan said he would continue to monitor developments in Ukraine, where there have been reports of civilian casualties, and he called for ""restraint and strict adherence to the applicable rules of international humanitarian law."" U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet says her office has confirmed that 102 civilians, including seven children, have been killed in the Russian invasion and 304 others wounded in Ukraine since Thursday. She cautioned that the tally was likely a vast undercount. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is among the court's 123 member states, but Ukraine has accepted the court's jurisdiction, which empowers Khan to investigate. Khan has told his team to explore how to preserve evidence of crimes and said that the next step is to seek authorization from the court's judges to open an investigation. However, he added that the process would be speeded up if a member nation of the court were to ask for an investigation in what is known as a referral.

2022-02-27,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/russia-nuclear-forces-ukraine-fighting/,Putin puts Russia's nuclear forces on alert as fighting in Ukraine continues,"Kyiv — In a dramatic escalation of East-West tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear deterrent forces put on alert Sunday in response to what he called ""aggressive statements"" by leading NATO powers. The move means Putin has ordered Russia's nuclear weapons prepared for increased readiness to launch, raising the threat that the tensions could boil over into a nuclear war. In giving it, the Russian leader also cited hard-hitting financial sanctions imposed by the West against Russia, including Putin himself. Amid the worrying development, the office of Ukraine's president said a delegation would meet with Russian officials as Moscow's troops drew closer to Kyiv. Putin, in giving the nuclear alert directive, cited not only the alleged statements by NATO members but the hard-hitting financial sanctions imposed by the West against Russia, including the Russian leader himself. Speaking at a meeting with his top officials, Putin told his defense minister and the chief of the military's General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a ""special regime of combat duty."" ""Western countries aren't only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,"" Putin said in televised comments. Putin threatened in the days before Russia's invasion to retaliate harshly against any nations that intervened directly in the conflict in Ukraine, and he specifically raised the specter of his country's status as a nuclear power. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield denounced the move as a ""totally unacceptable"" escalation, telling ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday morning that the U.S. will ""continue here at the United Nations and around the world to use every possible lever we have at our disposal to expose his actions."" ""President Putin is continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable, and we have to continue to condemn his actions in the strongest possible way,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. The practical meaning of Putin's order was not immediately clear. Russia and the United States typically have the land- and submarine-based segments of their strategic nuclear forces on alert and prepared for combat at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not. If Putin is arming or otherwise raising the nuclear combat readiness of his bombers, or if he is ordering more ballistic missile submarines to sea, then the United States might feel compelled to respond in kind, according to Hans Kristensen, a nuclear analyst at the Federation of American Scientists. That would mark a worrisome escalation and a potential crisis, he said. The alarming step came as street fighting broke out in Ukraine's second-largest city and Russian troops squeezed strategic ports in the country's south, advances that appeared to mark a new phase of Russia's invasion following a wave of attacks on airfields and fuel facilities elsewhere in the country. The capital, Kyiv, was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault. ""The past night was tough – more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. ""There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn't consider as admissible targets."" Following its gains to the east in the city of Kharkiv and multiple ports, Russia sent a delegation to Belarus for peace talks with Ukraine, according to the Kremlin. Zelensky suggested other locations, saying his country was unwilling to meet in Belarus because it served as a staging ground for the invasion. Until Sunday, Russia's troops had remained on the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million about 20 kilometers 12.4 miles south of the border with Russia, while other forces rolled past to press the offensive deeper into Ukraine. Videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv and Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. One showed Ukrainian troops firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby. The images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine's bigger cities. Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces. Huge explosions lit up the sky early Sunday near Kyiv, where terrified residents hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault. Putin hasn't disclosed his ultimate plans, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraine's government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow's Cold War-era influence. The pressure on strategic ports in the south of Ukraine appeared aimed at seizing control of the country's coastline stretching from the border with Romania in the west to the border with Russia in the east. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said Russian forces had blocked the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea. He said the Russian forces also took control of an airbase near Kherson and the Azov Sea city of Henichesk. Ukrainian authorities also have reported fighting near Odessa, Mykolaiv and other areas. Cutting Ukraine's access to its sea ports would deal a major blow to the country's economy. It also could allow Moscow to build a land corridor to Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014 and until now was connected to Russia by a 19-kilometer 12-mile bridge, the longest bridge in Europe which opened in 2018. Flames billowed from an oil depot near an airbase in Vasylkiv, a city 23 miles south of Kyiv where there has been intense fighting, according to the mayor. Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, prompting the government to warn people to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze as protection from smoke, the president's office said. Ukrainian military deputy commander Lt.-Gen. Yevhen Moisiuk sounded a defiant note in a message aimed at Russian troops. ""Unload your weapons, raise your hands so that our servicemen and civilians can understand that you have heard us. This is your ticket home,"" Moisiuk said in a Facebook video. The U.S. pledged an additional $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, body armor and small arms. Germany said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to the besieged country and that it would close its airspace to Russian planes. The U.S., European Union and United Kingdom agreed to block ""selected"" Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system, which moves money around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions worldwide, part of a new round of sanctions aiming to impose a severe cost on Moscow for the invasion. They also agreed to impose ""restrictive measures"" on Russia's central bank. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said Sunday that his country is committing 100 billion euros, or $112.7 billion, to a special fund for its armed forces, raising its defense spending above 2% of gross domestic product. Scholz told a special session of the Bundestag the investment was needed ""to protect our freedom and our democracy.""",47,2.5128191487760976,2.648003556819989,-0.1351844080438913,7
2022-02-27,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/dfw/news/kyiv-mayor-proud-of-citizens-spirit-anxious-about-future/,"Kyiv Mayor Proud Of Citizens' Spirit, Anxious About Future","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv's mayor is filled with pride over his citizens' spirit yet anxious about how long they can hold out. In an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv. ""We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,"" he finally said. ""Right now we are encircled."" The AP was not able to immediately verify the mayor's report that Kyiv was encircled by Russian forces or how wide an area that would encompass due to a strict curfew Sunday on movement in the city. Klitschko himself later backed away from that assessment, saying on his Telegram channel that ""In the evening, Russian Internet publications spread information with reference to me that Kyiv is allegedly surrounded and evacuation of people is impossible. ... Do not believe lies! Trust information only from official sources."" When Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the capital city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters. The mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child. A Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside during this time could be considered a saboteur. ""We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,"" Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian saboteurs were killed Saturday night. Russian troops' advance on the city has been slower than many military experts had expected but the overall Russian military advantage is well-known to all. ""Ï just talked to the president (Volodymyr Zelenskyy). Everybody is not feeling so well,"" Klitschko said, adding that city government employees were in shock but not depressed. ""We show our character, our knowledge, our values."" In the last few days, long queues of people — both men and women — were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the Ukrainian capital after authorities decided to distribute arms freely to anybody ready to defend the city. There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists. ""To be honest, we don't have 100% control,"" said Klitschko. ""We built this territorial defense (system) in a short amount of time — but these are patriotic people."" ""Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,"" he added. Responding to a question about the city's capacity to replenish dwindling stocks of food and medicine, Klitscho's view darkened, however. ""We are at the border of a humanitarian catastrophe,"" he said. ""Right now, we have electricity, right now we have water and heating in our houses. But the infrastructure is destroyed to deliver the food and medication."" Then, in the same breath, he rallied like the world heavyweight boxing champion he once was. ""That's why the message for everyone is support Ukraine together ... we are strong,"" he said. ""Every Ukrainian is proud to be independent, proud to be Ukrainian, and we are proud to have our own country."" (© Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

2022-02-27,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ukraine-invasion-russia-resistance-slowed-advance/,"Russian advance slowed by Ukrainian resistance and logistical setbacks, U.S. defense official says","The Russian forces invading Ukraine have faced more resistance than the U.S. believes Russia anticipated, a senior defense official said Sunday morning. The Russian forces have advanced toward three cities, including Kyiv, but have not yet captured a city since invading. ""The Ukrainians are putting up a very stiff and brave and heroic resistance, but we are only in Day Four, and I would be reluctant to provide an estimate of how many more days there are and what those days are going to look like,"" the senior defense official said. The U.S. Defense Department estimates about two-thirds of the combat power Russia had arrayed around Ukraine's borders have now been committed inside Ukraine. That leaves about one-third that have yet to enter the country, which is a significant amount of power still at the ready. The Russian advances on both Kharkiv and Kyiv have been slowed by fuel and logistical shortages and by the stiff and ""creative"" resistance by the Ukrainians, according to the official. The Russian advance forces are still about 30 kilometers outside of Kyiv. There are indications that some reconnaissance elements are inside Kyiv's city center putting up a fight but the main forces are still 30 kilometers away, which is about where the forces were on Saturday too. One change that concerns U.S. officials is the first indications the Russians are adopting siege tactics in Chernihiv, on the way to Kyiv, for a full out effort to capture it. The Russians have started firing rockets, which are imprecise weapons, inside the city that risk hitting civilian infrastructure. On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert in response to statements by Western countries and NATO. The senior defense official said the move was ""unnecessary and escalatory"" since Russia is not under threat by NATO or Ukraine. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin learned of Putin's decision from his announcement, the defense official said. Putin's announcement came just before Austin hosted an operations and policy synchronization meeting attended by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, combatant commanders, as well as senior policy leaders. The leaders discussed Putin's announcement during the meeting. The Russian invasion into Ukraine advances along three lines of assault. One, north to south, from Belarus towards Kyiv. Another, northeast to south, towards Kharkiv. And a third from the South towards central Ukraine. The southern advance has forked, with some Russian forces headed northwest towards Kherson and others splitting off northeast towards Mariupol. On Saturday, the Russians used an estimated four landing ships to conduct an amphibious assault about 70 kilometers from Mariupol with several thousand naval infantry troops. They have advanced about 20 kilometers since then, and are about 50 kilometers out from Mariupol. The U.S. government on Sunday advised Americans in Russia to ""leave immediately,"" according to an advisory posted by the State Department. The State Department is urging citizens to leave Russia now because an increasing number of airlines are canceling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines",7,1.9589868087467641,3.9048863993393654,-1.9458995905926013,27

Hutchison, who also served as a Republican U.S. Senator of Texas warned Friday that more trouble could be ahead if the United States and its European allies don't come down hard on Russia now. ""Right now, we are seeing a Cold War. But what we need to do is prevent a hot war. And how we act in this Cold War period with Ukraine will determine if we are going to get into a hot war, which would be so much more dangerous for America.""

They looked at how we handled Afghanistan and I think that emboldened our adversaries to think that well, maybe we would just go away."" Ukraine is a NATO partner not a member, so the United States and NATO won't send troops to defend that nation. If Russia were to invade another country that is a NATO member, Hutchison said American troops would be among those sent to defend that country from Russia. ""Any invasion of a NATO country will cause that to happen. So we're looking out ahead, and the Europeans need to come to the table with us."" She said Europe must join the U.S. in imposing even tougher sanctions against Russia. ""I think we need to go into the heaviest sanctions against Russia to really hobble their economy, we need to have trade controls that will keep them from being able to sell their Russian oil and gas."" Hutchison also believes the U.S. should sell its liquified natural gas to Europe.

CBS 11 emailed the U.S. Department of Energy Friday afternoon to see if the U.S. is considering exporting liquified natural gas to Europe but we didn't hear back. Hutchison said Putin needs to pay a price for his invasion into Ukraine and said that didn't happen after he invaded Georgia in 2008 and annexed Crimea in 2014. ""There were no real consequences.

2022-02-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-conflict-explainer/,EXPLAINER: What Does Russian President Vladimir Putin Want In Ukraine?,"(CNN) -- After months of military buildup and brinkmanship on its border with Ukraine, Russia invaded its ex-Soviet neighbor with a multi-pronged attack, threatening to destabilize Europe and draw in the United States. A whirlwind of diplomatic efforts to stave off a Russian invasion in recent weeks failed to defuse tensions that had mounted over months. Russia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep. The escalation in the years-long conflict between Russia and Ukraine has triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia's attacks on several parts of Ukraine raise the specter of a dangerous showdown between Western powers and Moscow. So how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know. Several areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a ""special military operation"" and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms. The move came after months of speculation about what Moscow's intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. More than 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials. Some of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv. The coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation. The territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia's intended creep into Ukraine. Russia repeatedly denied it was planning an assault, but an escalation in shelling in eastern Ukraine heightened fears that it could be stoking the violence to justify a wider conflict. As the situation on Ukraine's border has intensified, NATO has raised the readiness of its rapid response force, while member countries put troops on standby and deployed battalions, planes and ships to the region. US President Joe Biden said Thursday the US would deploy additional troops to Germany and redeploy some forces already in Europe to NATO eastern flank allies. In recent weeks, the US has sent several thousand soldiers into NATO countries in Eastern Europe. The US says it has no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. On Thursday, NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a ""grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security."" Also on Thursday, the US unveiled new sanctions that will cut off certain strategic imports to Russia, adding to a ""first tranche"" of measures targeting two large financial institutions, the country's sovereign debt, and Russian elites and their family members. Biden has vowed the world will ""hold Russia accountable"" for the invasion, and is expected to spell out a set of additional sanctions, which were once meant to deter such an assault. Biden and European leaders have previously warned that Russia would suffer serious consequences should Putin move ahead with a wider invasion. But that has not stopped Russia from continuing to bolster its military positions. In late 2021 and early 2022, satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow's closest international ally. Despite receiving funding, training and equipment from the US and other NATO member countries, experts say Ukraine would be significantly outmatched by Russia's military, which has been modernized under Putin's leadership. If an all-out war broke out between the two countries, tens of thousands of civilians could die and up to 5 million could be made refugees, according to some estimates. Ukraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future -- crossing a red line for Russia. Putin sees NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act"" -- a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine's aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia. In interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe. In early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. In the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create ""a pretext for an invasion."" In a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people,"" and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia's orbit through a ""forced change of identity."" That type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin's emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation on Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine's own sovereignty. But Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West's ""puppet."" In fact, Putin's efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance. In December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe -- proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters. Putin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. ""It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,"" he said at his annual news conference late last year. ""Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep."" High-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe's leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine's east -- known as the Normandy Format talks -- could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis. In a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a ""genocide"" against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress -- echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea. But less than a week later, after Russia's upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements ""no longer exist,"" adding: ""What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?"" The agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 -- which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine -- have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved. Moscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and -- although unclear in what sequence -- would also restore the Ukrainian government's control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics. Putin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. ""Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,"" Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: ""We are not his."" President Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country. ""Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we've been building, everything we are living for,"" Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page. In Kyiv, where Ukrainians had continued to go about their daily business while Russian troops sat at their borders, the streets were empty on Thursday. Across the country, residents have been preparing for the worst -- packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists. Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN. Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline -- connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany -- as a threat to its own security. Nord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea -- in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe. After requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin's decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 is just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky's government. The former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, has had a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019. His government's popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy. Many Ukrainians are unhappy that the government has not delivered on the promises that brought it into power, including cracking down on corruption in the country's judicial system. But the more pressing concern is Zelensky's failure so far to bring peace to the country. (The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

(CBS4)- Thousands of miles away in Colorado, it's easy to think the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a European problem, but just like the internet can give you a front-row seat to the fighting, it can also expose you to cyberattacks. ""Russia may well look to retaliate to the U.S. and Western allies as a response to economic sanctions,"" said Dr. Iain Boyd, the Director for The Center for National Security Initiatives at The University of Colorado Boulder.

""They would like to put pressure on the U.S. government to relax those or remove those sanctions,"" he says. It's not just hard targets like financial institutions, defense companies, large-scale infrastructure, utilities, or large companies that should be concerned. Dr. Boyd says cyber attackers will go after soft targets like schools, media companies and even individuals to sew as much chaos as possible. Luckily you are your own best line of defense. Boyd says make sure you have up to date malware and antivirus software on your computer, enable two factor authentications for your accounts, back up your files, change your passwords often and be careful what links you click on even if it seems legit.

He said his family members are safe, he said, but they have had to hide for safety during attacks. He said they can hear the explosions and see the aftermath.

A parallel, less visible attack is also being monitored online. ""Every company out there should think that they are in crisis mode,"" James Turgal said. Turgal oversees the cyber risk division for Optive Security in Denver, his background includes years as the Assistant Director of the FBI's information and technology branch. He says Russia's use of cyber-attacks will continue, and likely increase in severity. ""It's absolutely going to be utilized. Those same types of attacks are going to be used here as the U.S. starts to put political pressure on that government,"" he said. The likely targets in the U.S. would be our critical infrastructures like power grids or financial intuitions. Colorado Congressman Ken Buck says it's a possibility lawmakers have considered. ""Of course it is vulnerable and yes we have thought about it and yes the government is taking action to do our very best to be able to bring something back up very quickly but the reality is that is an act of war and when you engage in war with a nuclear power, a power that has far greater cyber capabilities than you do, Putin would be foolish to go down that road,"" he said. While personal accounts online are at less risk of being hacked, there is widespread agreement that Russia will utilize social media and its reach, in their fight. ""You're going to see them utilizing those platforms to either spread disinformation or some other type of propaganda that would help the invasion or help the regime,"" Turgal said. ""Vladimir Putin is a child of the KGB, he absolutely understands the value of propaganda,"" Buck said. Turgal says all companies especially those doing business in Europe should be proactive in protecting their networks, increasing security with encryption and two-factor authentication.",20,3.1960803672016453,5.196733691053576,-2.000653323851931,28

2022-02-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/cyber-advice-to-prevent-cyber-hacking/,Cyber Security Experts Provide Advice To Better Protect Everything On Your Computer From Possible Russian Cyber Hacking,"CHICAGO (CBS) -- One of the first ways Americans may feel the effects of Russia's war against Ukraine is online. Experts say Russian cyber hackers have upped their game in recent years. That could put everything from planes in the sky to family photos on your computer at greater risk. CBS 2's Chris Tye reports what you can do and what may set this all into motion. Experts say watch the sanctions. When German sanctions targeted a gas pipeline crucial to Russia, the energy sector braced for sharper cyberattacks. Economic sanctions put banks on high alert. And the longer this goes on, experts say, the more likely consumers are to become targets too. ""The first thing that could happen, if it was ransomware, your computer can be encrypted. So, everything on your computer you could lose everything-- from family photos to sensitive documents."" Rick Holland monitors cyber-crime for cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows. And a spike, he says, seems likely soon. ""This isn't a cyber Pearl Harbor, but this is something we do need to track,"" Holland said. Already tracking more aggressively: Companies with Russian connections or connections to areas where sanctions are at play. ""The more specific and targeted they are, the chance for a tit for tat Russian response increases,"" Holland said. ""Every company out there should think that they are in crisis mode."" Consumers, while not in crisis yet, should put their antenna up and firm up online security routines. ""Number one is to use unique passwords to things that you log into,"" Holland said, ""Another thing that you can do is make sure the antivirus is running on your machine and that it's up to date."" ""And then of course the eternal advice is don't click on links. If you get an email, even if someone you know, don't go to the link for the retailer or whoever it is. Go directly to the website itself to confirm what that email is saying."" Failing to do so could give cyber-criminals access to not just what's on your computer, but what's in your bank accounts and other private information. ""Right now we haven't seen tit for tat on this, something we are tracking for the next few weeks."" The other piece of online manipulation is social media. As we saw on display in the presidential elections of 2016 and 2020, misinformation presented on our personal feeds from sources that have all the earmarks of being people we know and trust. Often, the FBI says, the work of Russian operatives.",20,4.624256309305835,4.940311149211542,-0.31605483990570704,16

""When President Biden addressed the nation today, he said that Putin wants a new Soviet Union. Is there intelligence to suggest that President Putin will advance beyond Ukraine?"" ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell asked Blinken in an interview on Thursday. ""You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants,"" the top U.S. diplomat said. ""He's made clear that he'd like to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. And short of that, he'd like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral."" But Putin would face intense resistance from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in doing so, he said. ""Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine's borders, there's something very powerful standing in his way,"" Blinken added. ""That's Article 5 of NATO — an attack on one is an attack on all. It's exactly why we've been reinforcing NATO's eastern flank."" The Biden administration has been adamant that it will not send U.S. troops into Ukraine, which is not part of NATO, though it is stationing troops in nearby countries. Instead, the U.S. is arming Ukraine with weapons and has unleashed a series of sanctions against Russia. When asked what the U.S. was doing to lower the risk of an accidental escalation between U.S. troops in nearby countries and Russian forces, Blinken said the Biden administration wants to have ""communication with Russia on a military basis to make very clear what it risks if it miscalculates."" As Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, Putin warned that countries that stood in its way would face severe consequences that have never been seen in history, raising concerns that he was threatening a nuclear attack. ""I can't begin to get into his head and to say exactly what he means by that,"" Blinken said. ""We've prepared for whatever course that he chooses to take.""

""We know that Ukraine has been a test bed for Russian cyberattacks for at least the last half decade,"" said Dan Patterson with CBS News Technology. On Wednesday, there were several more of those so-called nuisance cyberattacks, targeting multiple Ukrainian government websites and even banks. ""These aren't real deep systems or critical infrastructure attacks, rather they launch distributed denial of services these are DDoS attacks designed to take websites offline, some defacement attacks, and they did launch a few wipers, meaning they erase data on hard drives,"" added Patterson. The attacks prompted the National Cyber Security Center to issue warning, one of them to British organizations urging them to bolster their online defenses.

""According to the FBI and other law enforcement, we have not seen acts of Russian aggression targeting United States critical infrastructure. That is not to say they're not capable of it,"" Patterson went on. Last year after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Joe Biden addressed the nation about their conversation, which included cybersecurity. ""I talked about the proposition that certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack, period. By cyber or any other means, I gave them a list, if I'm not mistaken, I don't have it in front of me, with 16 specific entities,"" the president said.

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is the site of the heaviest fighting, the official said.

Kathy Hochul: New York City on ""heightened alert"" for attacks by Russian hackers","NEW YORK -- The Big Apple could very well be Vladimir Putin's next target, and he wouldn't even have to fire a single bullet. The battlefield could end up being cyberspace. As CBS2's Marcia Kramer reported Thursday, officials here are on high alert for a possible attack as a tit-for-tat response to the imposition of tough sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine. It's just under 5,000 miles from Red Square to Times Square, but the faint tentacles of cyberhackers could reach here in minutes, causing untold havoc in a target-rich city like New York. Already, Gov. Kathy Hochul is marshalling state cyberwarriors to repel the Russians. ""We are on heightened alert with respect to cybersecurity and our own defenses,"" Hochul said. The governor says she is working with the feds and local governments to detect and prevent cyberattacks related to the Russian military advances in Ukraine. Just days ago she and Mayor Eric Adams opened a joint cybersecurity command center in downtown Brooklyn. ""First time in our nation there's been this level or coordination,"" Hochul said. The Russian threat is serious, especially after reports that some Ukrainian computers were hit by data-wiping software as the invasion was launched. ""The bottom line is we have to be strong and vigilant in every area. Who knows what the heck Putin will do?"" Sen. Chuck Schumer said. Security expert Manny Gomez says vigilance now is imperative. ""New York is the number one target with all its financial centers -- the Dow Jones, the stock exchange, the AMEX, the NASDAQ. If he takes out New York, it's going to be sure chaos. Plus, the repercussions of that because it's New York City, it is the capital of the world internationally, it's going to have a huge impact,"" Gomez said. And its not just Wall Street. The city has a subway system that moves millions of people a day, major corporate headquarters, and some of the world's top teaching hospitals. ""As a security expert, what's your biggest worry for New York State and New York City?"" Kramer asked Gomez. ""My biggest worry are the energy grids because you take one or more of those out, you don't have to take out a single entity like the MTA or a hospital of the stock market. You take them all out,"" he said. Officials have said that hackers make hundreds of attempts to get into our systems every day. Last year, the city Law Department was breached. A hacking group believed to have links to the Chinese government penetrated the MTA last April. A spokesman for Mayor Adams told CBS2 that the former cop is getting regular briefings. ""We're remaining vigilant,"" the spokesman said, ""but we haven't seen any new credible threats at this time.""",20,5.034639470567763,4.946524894142378,0.08811457642538478,24

Beijing has trod a cautious line on Ukraine as Moscow has massed thousands of troops along the neighboring nation's borders. China criticized the West for imposing more sanctions after Russia ordered troops into two breakaway Ukrainian regions that Moscow now recognizes as independent. President Joe Biden earlier stressed that the penalties were only a ""first tranche,"" adding that more sanctions would come if Russian President Vladimir Putin extended his country's military grip beyond the two territories in the eastern Donbas region. China and Russia have grown closer in recent years as they've become more estranged from the West, and more at odds with the U.S. Earlier this month, Putin traveled to Beijing and met with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping as the Russian leader massed forces around Ukraine's borders. On Wednesday, China lashed out at Washington over the new sanctions against Russia and said it was raising tensions by sending weapons to Ukraine. The U.S. actions were ""raising tensions, creating panic, and even playing up the schedule of war,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters. ""If someone is adding fuel to the fire while blaming others... then that behavior is irresponsible and immoral,"" she added, turning the spotlight on the United States in response to a question on China's role in resolving the situation. She said China had ""called on all parties to respect and attach importance to each other's legitimate security concerns, strive to resolve issues through negotiation and consultation, and jointly maintain regional peace and stability."" Asked if China would impose sanctions on Russia, Hua added that Beijing believes ""sanctions have never been a fundamental and effective way to solve problems."" Apart from the United States, Britain, the European Union, Japan and Australia also announced penalties following Putin's announcement that he would send soldiers into Donetsk and Luhansk. On Tuesday, President Biden said Washington would continue to supply ""defensive"" weapons to Ukraine against a Russian invasion, and deploy U.S. troops to reinforce NATO allies in Eastern Europe.

Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams have opened a first-of-its-kind command center in Brooklyn to oversee cybersecurity across the state. As CBS2's Marcia Kramer reported Tuesday, it's especially important after both the MTA and the city Law Department were hacked last year. We have a subway system that moves millions of people a day, Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange, a sensitive electric grid, the headquarters of many major corporations. The city is a target-rich environment that, given the rising tensions in Eastern Europe, could prove hard to resist for Russian cyberhackers intent on payback. ""The threat of cyberattacks is very real, particularly now. That is the warning we are receiving out of Washington, particularly for a place like New York,"" Hochul said. ""If we don't get a handle on cybersecurity, what COVID did to our bodies, cybersecurity is going to disrupt the anatomy of our city and our state,"" Adams added. Shortly after President Joe Biden announced heavy sanctions against Russia, Hochul, Adams and mayors from across the state announced the opening of a joint security operations center in Brooklyn to combat cyberthreats. Hochul said she has been in constant contact with Washington to discuss the real concern that Russian hackers will try to disrupt things here. ""Sometimes, for every action there's a reaction. Shame on us if we're not anticipating and watching what's happening across the globe,"" Hochul said. The governor made the comparison to the terror attacks on 9/11, equating the efforts we made to ward of physical terror attacks to the need to protect our businesses and critical infrastructure. ""We're on notice what they can do to dismantle our communications systems, our 911 system, our transportation network. They all run on technology. You disrupt that technology, that connectivity, there is an opportunity for rather cataclysmic consequences,"" Hochul said. The joint command center will have 117 desks for state, local and federal officials to assess and monitor potential threats in real time. They will also be able to streamline threat intelligence and responses in the event of a significant cyberattack. Officials say hackers make hundreds and hundreds of attempts to get into our systems every day. Last year, the city Law Department was breached.

""This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine ... so I'm going to begin to impose sanctions in response,"" Mr. Biden said at the White House, in response to Putin's decision to send ""peacekeeping"" forces into Ukraine's eastern breakaway regions hours after he formally recognized Luhansk and Donetsk as independent from Ukraine on Monday. Mr. Biden said the sanctions, closely coordinated with allies and partners, will target two large banks in Russia and its sovereign debt. ""That means we cut off Russia's government from western financing,"" the president said. A White House official said the sanctions the president announced Tuesday would be ""swift and severe."" The U.S. is imposing sanctions on Russia's elite and their family members, and a senior administration official told reporters on a call Tuesday that export controls are also being considered. Additionally, the U.S. is moving its forces already deployed in Europe to NATO countries bordering Russia on the west, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in response to Putin's refusal to withdraw troops from Belarus. The move is intended to reassure those countries that they will be protected if Russia attacks. ""Let me be clear — these are totally defensive moves on our part,"" Mr. Biden said. ""We have no intention of fighting Russia."" The president added, ""Whatever Russia does next, we're ready to respond with unity, clarity and conviction."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that a previously scheduled meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, would no longer take place ""now that we see the invasion beginning."" The meeting was intended to lay the groundwork for a potential diplomatic solution — or at least see if it was possible for Mr. Biden and Putin to hold a summit. ""Now that we see the invasions beginning in Russia ... it does not make sense to go forward with that meeting at this time,"" Blinken said. ""I consulted with our allies and partners all agree."" He said he sent a letter to Lavrov Tuesday informing him of this. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday would not say what Russian action would trigger the fullest extent of U.S. sanctions. The recognition of the breakaway territories as independent was soon followed by new U.S. sanctions ordered by Mr. Biden Monday night. The executive order he signed Monday bars new investment and trade and financing by individuals in the U.S. in Luhansk and Donetsk, both in the Donbas region in Eastern Ukraine. European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders called Russia's declaration of Donetsk and Luhnask's independence — and the decision to send forces into the breakaway regions — an ""act of war."" Meanwhile, Germany has halted the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was constructed under the Baltic Sea to bring natural gas directly from Russia to Germany. Mr. Biden had said there wouldn't be a Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine, but that decision ultimately rested with Germany.

The Biden administration quickly imposed limited new sanctions on Russia Monday evening after Putin formally recognized the rebel-held Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent from Ukraine — a move blasted by many nations as a violation of both international law and Ukraine's sovereignty. ""The darkness of uncertainty has fallen,"" Ukraine's Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov said in a written statement on Tuesday. ""The Kremlin has taken another step towards the revival of the Soviet Union… There are difficult challenges ahead. There will be losses. We will have to go through pain, overcome fear and despair."" On Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it would soon evacuate its embassy staff from Ukraine ""to protect their lives and safety,"" alleging that the Russian embassy and consulates general in Ukraine had faced ""repeated attacks"" since 2014. The Western response to Putin's escalating aggression against Ukraine carries risk in itself: The U.S. and its allies are walking a tightrope, trying to keep diplomatic efforts afloat while preventing Putin from cleaving off yet another chunk of an eastern European democracy for Russia. Western leaders have warned that if negotiations with Russia fail, it could lead to the bloodiest military conflict in Europe since World War II — and send already-high energy prices through the roof, threatening economies from Kyiv to Washington. European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders called Russia's unilateral declaration of Donetsk's and Luhnask's independence — and Putin's decision to send so-called peacekeeping forces into the breakaway regions — an ""act of war."" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield dismissed the notion that Russia was carrying out any sort of peacekeeping mission there as ""nonsense."" ""We know what they really are,"" she said of the Russian forces during an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council convened late on Monday evening. She said Russia was trying to ""create a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine."" ""We will continue to consult with our allies and partners in the coming hours on the way forward,"" a U.S. State Department spokesperson said. ""We are committed to finding a diplomatic resolution that avoids a brutal and costly conflict, but diplomacy cannot succeed unless Russia changes course."" On Tuesday, the Biden administration backed away from plans for Secretary of State Antony Blinken to hold a direct meeting on Thursday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. Blinken said Tuesday that the meeting — which was intended to lay the groundwork for a potential diplomatic solution — would no longer take place ""now that we see the invasion beginning."" ""It does not make sense to go forward with that meeting at this time,"" Blinken said. European nations, including some that rely directly on Russian natural gas supplies to heat homes, tried to show a unified front on Tuesday. In a significant move, Germany took steps to halt the certification of the brand new ""Nord Stream 2"" pipeline, a multi-billion dollar project intended to double the amount of gas pumped directly from Russia to Germany. Owned by Russia's state-backed energy company Gazprom, the pipeline has always been controversial because it circumvented Ukraine and would thus deprive Kyiv of fees it charges for the transit of Russian gas to Western Europe. The U.S. has long voiced opposition to Germany switching on the pipeline, saying it would increase the ally's dependence on Russia for energy and potentially give Russia new leverage over Europe. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised, meanwhile, to ""immediately institute a package of economic sanctions"" against Russia, and officials from major EU economies were set to gather in Paris to discuss the same. ""This is, I should stress, just the first barrage of U.K. economic sanctions against Russia, because we expect, I'm afraid, that there is more Russian irrational behavior to come,"" Johnson said in London. U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace called Russia's actions in eastern Ukraine ""incredibly serious."" ""This is a sovereign state that has now had some of its land effectively annexed from it. This is a sovereign state that is a democratic state in Europe, all of us in Europe should worry,"" Wallace said. ""We should not hesitate to take whatever action we need to to deter President Putin from undermining both NATO, but also Europe, and more importantly, our values."" ""Everything is on the table,"" the EU's Reynders told Belgian broadcaster RTBF on Tuesday morning about the sanctions the bloc was ready to impose. The West has threatened Putin and his government with sanctions for months, but the threats have failed to deter him from marching steadily down the path toward another invasion of Ukraine. Asked on Tuesday whether his country's Western partners were doing enough to support Ukraine and dissuade Putin from a full-scale invasion, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov would only say: ""We will see."" Putin last sent troops over the border in 2014, when he annexed the Crimean Peninsula away from Ukraine. His government has supported the separatists in the breakaway regions since then, framing the conflict as a struggle by ethnic Russians in Ukraine against tyrannical leaders in Kyiv — even claiming that Ukraine's government is carrying out a ""genocide"" in the area. Last week, the U.S. laid out the steps it feared Putin would take, starting with ""false-flag"" incidents and dramatic claims to create a pretext for invasion, and leading up to a possible attempted military overthrow of Kyiv. With as many as 190,000 Russian forces massed around Ukraine's borders, Moscow and the rebels who are effectively Putin's proxy forces in eastern Ukraine continue to accuse Ukrainian troops of shelling in the region. Ukraine denies attacking the breakaway areas or sending any troops across the border to carry out ""sabotage"" attacks in Russia, as Moscow claimed it was doing on Monday. At the emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Monday, Russia's Ambassador said Russia was still open to diplomacy, but would not allow ""a new bloodbath in the Donbas."" With video showing apparent Russian forces moving in to bolster the rebels, it remained unclear how many more might follow in the coming days.

2022-02-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-breakaway-regions-russia-donbas-donetsk-luhansk/,"What to know about Ukraine's separatist republics, Donetsk and Luhansk, in the Donbas region","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized the independence of Moscow-backed rebel regions in eastern Ukraine, a move that will further fuel tensions with the West amid fears of Russian invasion. Putin's move follows days of heightened tensions in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, where Ukrainian forces are locked in a nearly eight-year conflict with Russia-backed separatists that has left more than 14,000 people dead. Here is a look at the history behind the rebel-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine: When Ukraine's Moscow-friendly president was driven from office by mass protests in February 2014, Russia responded by annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. It then threw its weight behind an insurgency in the mostly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine region known as Donbas. In April 2014, Russia-backed rebels seized government buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, proclaimed the creation of ""people's republics"" and battled Ukrainian troops and volunteer battalions. The following month, the separatist regions held a popular vote to declare independence and make a bid to become part of Russia. Moscow did not accept the motion, but used the regions as a tool to keep Ukraine in its orbit and prevent it from joining NATO. Ukraine and the West accused Russia of backing the rebels with troops and weapons. Moscow denied that, saying any Russians who fought there were volunteers. Amid ferocious battles involving tanks, heavy artillery and warplanes, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. An international probe concluded that the passenger jet was downed by a Russia-supplied missile from the rebel-controlled territory in Ukraine. Moscow still denied any involvement. After a massive defeat of Ukrainian troops in August 2014, envoys from Kyiv, the rebels and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe signed a truce in the Belarusian capital of Minsk in September 2014. The document envisaged an OSCE-observed cease-fire, a pullback of all foreign fighters, an exchange of prisoners and hostages, an amnesty for the rebels and a promise that separatist regions could have a degree of self-rule. The deal quickly collapsed and large-scale fighting resumed, leading to another major defeat for Ukrainian forces at Debaltseve in January-February of 2015. France and Germany brokered another peace agreement, which was signed in Minsk in February 2015 by representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the rebels. It envisaged a new cease-fire, a pullback of heavy weapons and a series of moves toward a political settlement. A declaration backing the deal was signed by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. The 2015 peace deal was a major diplomatic coup for the Kremlin, obliging Ukraine to grant special status to the separatist regions, allowing them to create their own police force and have a say in appointing local prosecutors and judges. It also envisaged that Ukraine could only regain control over the roughly 125-mile border with Russia in rebel regions after they get self-rule and hold OSCE-monitored local elections — balloting that would almost certainly keep pro-Moscow rebels in power there. Many Ukrainians see it as a betrayal of national interests and its implementation has stalled. The Minsk document helped end full-scale fighting, but the situation has remained tense and regular skirmishes have continued. With the Minsk deal stalled, Moscow's hope to use rebel regions to directly influence Ukraine's politics has failed. But the frozen conflict has drained Kyiv's resources and effectively stymied its goal of joining NATO — which is enshrined in the Ukrainian constitution. Moscow also has worked to secure its hold on the rebel regions by handing out more than 720,000 Russian passports to roughly one-fifth of their population of about 3.6 million. It has provided economic and financial assistance to the separatist territories, but the aid has been insufficient to alleviate the massive damage from fighting and shore up the economy. The Donbas region accounted for about 16% of Ukraine's GDP before the conflict. Amid soaring tensions over the Russian troop concentration near Ukraine, France and Germany embarked on renewed efforts to encourage compliance with the 2015 deal, in hopes that it could help defuse the current standoff. Facing calls from Berlin and Paris for its implementation, Ukrainian officials have strengthened their criticism of the Minsk deal and warned that it could lead to the country's demise. Two rounds of talks in Paris and Berlin between presidential envoys from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany have yielded no progress. The lower house of the Russian parliament, meanwhile, urged Putin last week to recognize the independence of Ukraine's rebel regions. Putin's recognition of the rebel-held territories' independence effectively shatters the Minsk peace agreements and will further fuel tensions with the West. The move follows several days of shelling that erupted along the line of contact in Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine and the West accused Moscow of fomenting the tensions to create a pretext for an invasion. Russia, in turn, accused Ukraine of trying to reclaim the rebel-held territories by force, a claim that Kyiv strongly rejected. On Friday, separatist leaders released video statements announcing the evacuation of civilians in the face of what they described as a Ukrainian ""aggression."" The data embedded in the video indicated that their statements had been pre-recorded two days earlier when the situation was still relatively calm, suggesting a deliberate plan to try to sever the regions from Ukraine. The rebel chiefs put out new video statements Monday urging Putin to recognize their regions' independence, and the Russian leader responded quickly by convening a carefully orchestrated meeting of his Security Council and then signing the recognition decrees in a televised ceremony.",4,3.419072403834358,2.358985511082302,1.060086892752056,7
2022-02-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-putin-summit-russia-ukraine-invasion/,"Possible Biden-Putin summit on the table as U.S. warns Russia preparing ""full-scale assault"" on Ukraine","Kyiv, Ukraine — U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in principle on Sunday to meet, either in person or via video link, as diplomatic efforts to ease the crisis on Ukraine's borders took on new urgency with U.S. officials telling CBS News that Putin had ordered his troops to proceed with plans to invade. A U.S. official told CBS News that intelligence indicated Russian commanders had received orders to proceed with an invasion of Ukraine and were making specific plans for how to maneuver on the battlefield. The White House made it clear on Sunday that a Biden-Putin summit would not happen if Russia did invade Ukraine. The Kremlin said Monday that it was ""premature"" to discuss any concrete plans for a summit, but confirmed that Putin was ready to meet Mr. Biden if the two countries' top diplomats are able to lay the groundwork. ""The meeting is possible if the heads of state consider it appropriate. Now there is a clear, concrete understanding of the need to continue the dialogue at the level of the ministers,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov are scheduled to meet Thursday — if Russia doesn't launch an invasion before then. ""We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement late Sunday. ""Currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon,"" she added. The announcement of a possible summit between the U.S. and Russian leaders was made by the office of French President Emmanuel Macron, who spent Sunday on the phone with both presidents brokering the tentative agreement. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Monday requested an urgent meeting of U.N. Security Council nations — not necessarily a meeting at the Council — to discuss ways to de-escalate the crisis in the region, as well as the security of his country, reports CBS News' Pamela Falk. CBS News' Pamela Falk at U.N. headquarters said as Russia currently holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council, Moscow gets to decide whether to convene the meeting — unless a Security Council member nation - which Ukraine is not - joins Ukraine's call for it to happen. If that happens, diplomats told Falk that Russia is likely to try to block the meeting. Shelling has intensified, meanwhile, in eastern Ukraine along the line of contact between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists. The conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region has simmered for almost eight years, claiming about 14,000 lives, according to Ukrainian officials. But the crossfire increased significantly about a week ago amid warnings from U.S. officials that Russia could stage ""false-flag"" operations — incidents blamed on Ukrainian forces that Moscow could use as a pretext to invade. The Russian-backed rebels claimed on Monday that four civilians had been killed in their territory in Donbas over the last 24 hours, according to The Associated Press. Russian security officials were quoted by the country's media, meanwhile, as saying a shell from Ukraine had struck a guard post just across the border, inside Russia's Rostov region. There were no casualties reported in that alleged strike, but then there was a more serious accusation. Russia's military claimed that two vehicles carrying Ukrainian ""saboteurs"" into Russia had been destroyed, and that ""as a result of clashes, five people who violated the Russian border"" were killed. It was the first claim by Russia that Ukrainians had breached the country's border — a claim that was quickly labeled ""fake news"" by Ukraine's government, which said there were no Ukrainian forces operating in Russia's Rostov border region. Thousands of ethnic Russian civilians from Ukraine's rebel-occupied Donbas region have poured across the border into Rostov in recent days after being urged to do so by the separatist administrations there. The rebels said the evacuation of women and children was necessary due to purported Ukrainian shelling and plans to attack the region. Ukraine has denied attacking rebel-held territory, or firing any shells into Russian territory, saying instead that the separatists have been ""cynically firing from residential areas using civilians as shields."" The Ukrainian military's policy for years has been not to return fire along the front line unless there's deemed to be an imminent threat to life.",4,2.32846768403257,2.495914410290414,-0.16744672625784407,26
2022-02-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-shelling-donbas-nerves-fraying-in-kyiv/,"As fighting escalates with Russian-backed rebels, rising concern is testing Ukrainians' sense of calm","Kyiv, Ukraine — For millions of Ukrainians, there is no evacuation plan if Russia does invade their country. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, people across Ukraine have been on edge for weeks, hoping for any sign of a peaceful resolution to the crisis on the country's borders. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the possibility of a summit between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, saying he hoped it might lead to Russia pulling back the estimated 170,000-190,000 troops massed around his country's northern, eastern and southern borders. But the glimmer of hope for diplomacy came at the end of a weekend full of dramatic developments. As D'Agata reports, Russia made its most elaborate and choreographed show of force to date, holding nuclear military drills by land, sea and air. And while President Putin was on hand to observe the war games personally, his government knew full well it wasn't just Putin watching. Far more worrying, however, was the announcement that tens of thousands of Russian troops in Belarus — poised to strike from just across Ukraine's northwest border — will remain in the country indefinitely despite previous pledges from Moscow to bring them home after exercises there concluded on Sunday. Meanwhile, there has been a dramatic escalation in shelling by Russian-backed separatists on the front lines in eastern Ukraine. All this while the rebel leaders ramped up the propaganda war, warning of an alleged impending assault by Ukrainian forces. The rebels say tens of thousands of civilians have been evacuated from their territory into Russia, for their own safety. That has raised fears that Putin might use the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians to justify an invasion of Ukraine. Despite the ominous developments over the weekend, however, it was still business as usual in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv on Monday. But D'Agata says the prevailing calm in the city is being tested more every day by a rising sense of concern. ""Of course I am worried about my safety, of my family and my children, of course,"" Kyiv resident Maria told CBS News. But Alexei, who also lives in the capital, said he had no plans to leave the city yet, ""because I think many, many, many information in internet, in social media, is just fake."" He said he wished people would ""keep calm and believe in Ukraine."" Natalia, who also spoke to CBS News on the streets of Kyiv, admitted to being afraid, however. ""This is our motherland, our people, our children, and that's why I'm afraid,"" she told D'Agata. Hundreds of women took part in survival and self-defense courses over the weekend in Kyiv, but they, like all Ukrainians, know their country's forces are no match for the military might of Russia. Nobody in Ukraine wants to believe a full-scale invasion is either imminent or inevitable. The sharp escalation in fighting in the east is the most pressing concern in Kyiv right now. Over the weekend, D'Agata and his team went to the front line of the conflict that has simmered already for eight years, visiting a location not far from a recent artillery attack. Ukrainian commanders there told CBS News the escalation was like nothing they'd seen in years.",4,3.4397923033336815,1.4454329311371823,1.9943593721964992,21

The Security Council meeting comes as it's announced that a sizable number of Russian troops will remain in Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbor, following multinational military exercises that were initially scheduled to conclude over the weekend. Mr. Biden told reporters on Friday at the White House that he is ""convinced"" Russian President Vladimir Putin has already decided to attack its neighbor. That sentiment was further reiterated by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who said on Saturday that Russian forces ""are uncoiling and are now poised to strike."" CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reported Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that American intelligence believes Russian military commanders have received orders to proceed with an invasion of Ukraine. Top U.S. government and military officials have recently made public potential Russian strategies to justify an invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, Russia continued to amass troops along the Ukrainian border. Russian President Vladimir Putin denies he plans to invade Ukraine. In an interview Sunday on 60 Minutes, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told correspondent Lesley Stahl, ""We still see a room for diplomacy."" Stahl's interview with Kuleba came after a kindergarten was shelled in Ukraine's Donbas region, where the Ukrainian military has periodically exchanged fire with Russian-backed separatists since 2014. ""The situation on the ground is very fragile,"" Kuleba told 60 Minutes. ""Any returned fire can be considered as a provocation, as an attack. So we diligently follow rules. But, of course, we will not allow Russia to kill our soldiers, to kill our civilians. We will be defending our country."" Putin has stated repeatedly in recent years that he would use the Russian military to protect any Russian speakers around the world. It is one of the pretexts that U.S. officials have warned that Putin could use to attack Ukraine. Foreign Minister Kuleba told 60 Minutes that Ukraine is a bilingual country and that, ""The language issue is politicized but it's not actually an issue in our domestic life."" ""It doesn't make difference in Ukraine which language do you speak,"" Kuleba said to Stahl. ""It's a choice between democracy and authoritarian regime. It's a choice between belonging to a country that defends what it stands for and belonging to a country that attacks those who, in the view of that country, pose a threat to them.""",4,2.4792529112399784,1.4265102001193157,1.0527427111206626,26

As the likelihood of war between Russia and Ukraine inches closer and closer, people in Philadelphia say they've been anxiously watching and waiting to see what move Russia makes. ""My heart is broken,"" Marlyn Harris said. ""There are so many innocent people actually on both sides."" ""It does seem like they'll be war,"" she added. ""I don't know if Russia is just threatening, but when he speaks he has so much confidence and that's what worries me."" Harris' concerns echo throughout the local Ukrainian community. Outside of the Ukrainian Cultural Center in Jenkintown, signs saying ""Support Ukraine"" and ""Stop Russian Aggression"" hang clearly on windows near the entrance. On Sunday, a group went to Washington D.C. to ask President Joe Biden for more support. ""A more concerted action on the ground,"" Florence Speiser said. ""It seems like that would be more effective but no one wants to go there."" Eyewitness News caught up with people at the Bells Market, a Russian-Ukrainian store in Philadelphia. Many say while this may seem like a European issue, everyone should sympathize with the effects a war could have on a nation. ""A lot of people will be displaced again,"" one man said. ""And people are so, so far away from what's happening over there they can't really grasp the situation over there."" ""I feel for the people here in America who are so worried about their family over there,"" Harris said. The U.S. has intel that Russian commanders have been given orders to proceed with an invasion of Ukraine. The Associated Press reports Biden has agreed to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was brokered by France, if Russia doesn't invade Ukraine. Many, desperately hope diplomacy can quell the conflict. New U.S. intelligence sources confirm Russian troops have been ordered to invade Ukraine. Nearly 200,000 currently surround the county. But while Russia says military drills near the border will continue, it denies claims of an imminent attack. ""Everything we're seeing tells us that the decision we believe President Putin has made to invade is moving forward,"" Antony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, said. Russia intends to strike Ukraine's capital, but things remain relatively calm. On Sunday, Biden called an emergency meeting with his national security team. ""We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe,"" Vice President Kamala Harris said. As Russia's leader blames Ukraine for escalating tensions and NATO for providing Ukraine with weapons and ammunition, U.S. state officials say Russia must be stopped now to prevent future power plays, calling this one of the greatest threats to peace since the end of the Cold War.

2022-02-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/dfw/news/us-extended-russian-deployment-part-of-invasion-playbook/,US Claims Russia Has Ordered Final Preparations For Invasion Of Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine (CBSDFW.COM/AP) — Russia on Sunday rescinded earlier pledges to pull tens of thousands of its troops back from Ukraine's northern border, a move that U.S. leaders said put Russia another step closer to launching what they said was the planned invasion of Ukraine. Residents of Ukraine's capital filled a gold-domed cathedral to pray for peace. Russia's action extends what it said were military exercises, originally set to end Sunday, that brought an estimated 30,000 Russian forces to Belarus, Ukraine's neighbor to the north. They are among at least 150,000 Russian troops now deployed outside Ukraine's borders, along with tanks, warplanes, artillery and other war materiel. The continued deployment of the Russian forces in Belarus raised concern that they could be used to sweep down on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, a city of about 3 million people less than a three-hour drive away. In Kyiv, life outwardly continued as usual for some on a mild winter Sunday, with brunches and church services, ahead of what U.S. President Joe Biden said late last week was an already decided-upon Russian attack. Katerina Spanchak, who fled a region of eastern Ukraine when it was taken over by Russian-allied separatists, was among worshippers crowded into the capital's St. Michael's monastery, smoky with the candles burned by the faithful, to pray that Ukraine be spared. ""We all love life, and we are all united by our love of life,"" Spanchak said, pausing to compose herself. ""We should appreciate it every day. That's why I think everything will be fine."" ""Our joint prayers will help to elude this tragedy, which is advancing,"" said another worshipper, who identified himself only by his first name, Oleh. A U.S. official said Sunday that Biden's assertion that Putin has made the decision to roll Russian forces into Ukraine was based on intelligence that Russian front-line commanders have been given orders to begin final preparations for an attack. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sensitive intelligence. Russia held nuclear drills Saturday as well as the conventional exercises in Belarus, and has ongoing naval drills off the coast in the Black Sea. The announcement that Russia was reversing its pledge to withdraw its forces from Belarus came after two days of sustained shelling along a contact line between Ukraine's soldiers and Russian-allied separatists in eastern Ukraine, an area that Ukraine and the West worry could be the flashpoint in igniting conflict. The United States and many European countries have charged for weeks that Russia is trying to create pretexts to invade. They have threatened massive sanctions if it does. Biden convened the National Security Council at the White House on Russia's military buildup around Ukraine. White House officials released no immediate details of their roughly two hours of discussion. ""We're talking about the potential for war in Europe,"" U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said earlier Sunday at a security conference in Munich, Germany, that saw urgent consultations among world leaders on the crisis. ""It's been over 70 years, and through those 70 years ... there has been peace and security."" European and U.S. officials insisted they were still pursuing what U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken depicted as last-ditch diplomacy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday appealed on Twitter for a cease-fire. Russia has denied plans to invade, but the Kremlin did not respond to Zelenskyy's offer Saturday to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. After a call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Putin blamed Ukraine — incorrectly, according to observers there — for the escalation of shelling along the contact line and NATO for ""pumping modern weapons and ammunition"" into Ukraine. The Kremlin statement mentioned a cease-fire only in passing and made no mention of Zelenskyy's call for a meeting. Macron, who has been prominent in European diplomatic efforts with Putin, spoke separately to Zelenskyy and to Biden after his talks Sunday with Putin. Macron's office said both the Ukrainian and Russian leaders had agreed to work toward a diplomatic solution ""in coming days and coming weeks."" Blinken also renewed his offer to meet one-on-one with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov next week — on the condition, he said, that Russia had not invaded by then. ""Up to the last minute, there is still an option for him to pull back,"" Blinken told NBC's Meet the Press. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow issued an advisory urging greater caution by Americans in Russia overall. ""Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance,"" it warned. In the eastern Ukraine regions of Lugansk and Donetsk, separatist leaders have ordered a full military mobilization and sent more civilians to Russia, which has issued about 700,000 passports to residents of the rebel-held territories. Claims that Russian citizens are being endangered might be used as justification for military action. Officials in the separatist territories claimed Ukrainian forces launched several artillery attacks over the past day and that two civilians were killed during an unsuccessful assault on a village near the Russian border. Ukraine's military said two soldiers died in firing from the separatist side on Saturday. Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. ""When tension is escalated to the maximum, as it is now, for example, on the line of contact, then any spark, any unplanned incident or any minor planned provocation can lead to irreparable consequences,"" Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in an interview that aired Sunday on Russian state television. On the front lines, Ukrainian soldiers said they were under orders not to return fire. Zahar Leshushun, peering into the distance with a periscope, had followed the news all day from a trench where he is posted near the town of Zolote. ""Right now, we don't respond to their fire because ..."" the soldier said before being interrupted by the sound of an incoming shell. ""Oh! They are shooting at us now. They are aiming at the command post.""",4,1.3473269870463014,1.359822799979989,-0.012495812933687622,26

The orders don't mean a invasion is a certainty, as Russian President Vladimir Putin could still change the orders if he changes his mind, the official said. After weeks of warning that an invasion of Ukraine was imminent, President Biden told reporters on Friday that he was ""convinced"" Putin had made the decision to invade Ukraine and said the U.S. believed Russian forces intended to attack in the ""coming days."" Mr. Biden has agreed ""in principle"" to meet with Putin in the near future, provided an invasion has not begun, the White House announced Sunday night. The exact timing and location of such a talk have not been determined, but if it does happen, it would occur sometime after a meeting scheduled for this week between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Blinken told ""Face the Nation"" that the U.S. still believes Russia is ""moving forward"" with plans to invade, despite denials from Moscow that Russia is preparing to launch an attack. ""Everything we're seeing tells us that the decision we believe President Putin has made to invade is moving forward,"" Blinken said. ""We've seen that with provocations created by the Russians or separatist forces over the weekend, false flag operations, now the news just this morning that the 'exercises' Russia was engaged in in Belarus with 30,000 Russian forces that was supposed to end this weekend will now continue because of tensions in eastern Ukraine, tensions created by Russia and the separatist forces it backs there."" Russia has massed roughly 150,000 troops, warplanes and equipment on Ukraine's three sides, escalating tensions with the neighboring country. The defense minister of Belarus also announced Russia will be extending military drills taking place in the country near Ukraine's northern borders, which brought a large contingent of Russian troops to Belarus. In anticipation of an attack, the U.S. and other allies, most recently Germany and Austria, have urged their citizens to leave the country. The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine also temporarily relocated its operations from Kyiv to Lviv due to the acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow issued a security alert on Sunday warning that ""according to media sources, there have been threats of attacks against shopping centers, railway and metro stations, and other public gathering places in major urban areas, including Moscow and St. Petersburg as well as in areas of heightened tension along the Russian border with Ukraine."" The alert from the State Department urges U.S. citizens in Russia to take several actions, including avoiding crowds and having evacuation plans that don't rely on federal government assistance. While top U.S. officials have warned Russia is poised to strike Ukraine and the Pentagon has sent roughly 5,000 troops to Eastern Europe to bolster NATO forces, the Biden administration continues to keep a diplomatic option on the table. The president has stressed no American forces would go into Ukraine if Russia invades. ""My job as a diplomat is to leave absolutely no stone unturned and see if we can prevent war, and if there's anything I can do to do that, I'm going to do it,"" Blinken said Sunday. ""President Biden has made very clear that he's prepared to meet President Putin at any time in any format if that can help prevent a war. Even if the die is cast, until it's settled, until we know that the tanks are rolling, the planes are flying, and the aggression has fully begin, we're going to do everything we can to prevent it but we're prepared either way."" Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., said Ukrainian officials are using ""every possibility"" to force Russia to choose the diplomatic path rather than an attack. ""We are calling not only on [the] aggressor, which is Russia, but also on all of our friends and allies to get together and use every opportunity to still deter Russia from invading,"" she told ""Face the Nation."" Markarova said that while Ukraine will ""work day and night to make use of any possibility to still prevent Russia from invading,"" events of the past few days indicate that an escalation is likely, contrary to comments from Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Antonov that there is no plan for Russia to invade. ""What we see right now are all the strong messages are yet to get Russia not only to get out from the borders of Ukraine but they also, during the past three days, started an offensive,"" she said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, too, has called on Putin to meet with him to work to resolve the crisis, but he also criticized Western leaders gathered at a security conference in Munich on Saturday, arguing they should not wait for an attack to hit Russia with sanctions. The Biden administration has warned that if Putin orders an attack on Ukraine, there would be steep consequences for Russia, and Blinken said Sunday that slapping Russia with sanctions now would mean the loss of the ""deterrent effect."" ""Once you trigger the sanctions, you lose the deterrent effect,"" he said. ""As long as there is still even a minute's worth of time in which we can deter and prevent a war, we're going to try to uses it."" Blinken added that the U.S. doesn't want to detail its plans publicly, as ""that will forewarn Russia.""",4,1.184881096743804,1.350477988651001,-0.16559689190719706,26

""We don't need your sanctions after the bombardment will happen, and after our country will be fired at or after we will have no borders or after we will have no economy or parts of our country will be occupied. Why would we need those sanctions then?"" he said. Asked why a meeting between Putin and Zelensky hasn't happened if Russia claims it is interested in diplomacy, Antonov demurred, but asked, ""Why are you all looking just only on the one side? Why you prefer to ignore the second one? Why you are ignoring Russian concerns on security?"" Despite the build-up of forces and military equipment around Ukraine, Antonov said Russia does ""not threaten anyone,"" and Russia has a ""legitimate right to have our troops where we want on Russian territory."" ""We are not threaten[ing] to anybody. We are not threaten[ing] to United States. We are not threaten[ing] to Ukraine. It's very easy to solve this crisis,"" he said. ""If you persuade Kyiv to sit at the table of negotiations when Luhansk and Donbas people, so there will be no fighting, there will be peace, there no will be any casualties. It's so easy."" Moscow, Antonov said, is concerned with the weapons and security assistance the U.S. and allies have provided to Ukraine. He reiterated that Russia is opposed to an expansion of NATO, and wants the U.S. to withdraw troops and weaponry from its neighboring countries. ""We would like to put everything on the paper, we would like to see legally binding guarantees for Russian security,"" he said. ""We sent our package of proposals, what should we do?

Zelensky, in comments before the conference, also questioned the West's refusal to allow Ukraine to join NATO immediately. Putin has demanded that NATO not take Ukraine as a member. Harris stood by the U.S. decision to hold off on sanctions but said she wouldn't second guess Zelensky's ""desires for his country."" In new signs of fears that a war could start within days, Germany and Austria told their citizens to leave Ukraine. German air carrier Lufthansa canceled flights to the capital, Kyiv, and to Odessa, a Black Sea port that could be a key target in an invasion. NATO's liaison office in Kyiv said it was relocating staff to Brussels and to the western Ukraine city of Lviv. President Biden said late Friday that based on the latest American intelligence, he was now ""convinced"" that Putin has decided to invade Ukraine in coming days and assault the capital. Lines of communication between Moscow and the West remain open: the American and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Putin on Sunday for nearly two hours before a call with the Ukrainian president. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week. Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. Ukraine and the separatist leaders traded accusations of escalation. Russia on Saturday said at least two shells fired from a government-held part of eastern Ukraine landed across the border, but Ukraine's foreign minister dismissed that claim as ""a fake statement."" Top Ukrainian military officials came under a shelling attack during a tour of the front of the nearly eight-year separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. The officials fled to a bomb shelter before hustling from the area, according to an Associated Press journalist who was on the tour. The military on Sunday closed a key checkpoint leading to the separatist region after it came under repeated shelling. Elsewhere on the front lines, Ukrainian soldiers said they were under orders not to return fire. Zahar Leshushun, peering into the distance with a periscope, had followed the news all day from a trench where he is posted near the town of Zolote. ""Right now, we don't respond to their fire because ..."" the soldier started to explain before being interrupted by the sound of an incoming shell. ""Oh! They are shooting at us now. They are aiming at the command post."" Sporadic violence has broken out for years along the line separating Ukrainian forces from the Russia-backed separatists, but the spike seen in recent days is orders of magnitude higher than anything recently recorded by international monitors: nearly 1,500 explosions recorded in 24 hours. Denis Pushilin, the head of the pro-Russia separatist government in Ukraine's Donetsk region, cited an ""immediate threat of aggression"" from Ukrainian forces in his announcement of a call to arms. Ukrainian officials vehemently denied having plans to take rebel-controlled areas by force. ""I appeal to all the men in the republic who can hold weapons to defend their families, their children, wives, mothers,"" Pushilin said. ""Together we will achieve the coveted victory that we all need."" A similar statement followed from his counterpart in the Luhansk region. On Friday, the rebels began evacuating civilians to Russia with an announcement that appeared to be part of their and Moscow's efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor. Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation of civilians to Russia show that the files were created two days ago, the AP confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin's effort to come up with an invasion pretext could include staged, prerecorded videos. Ukraine's military said two of its soldiers died in firing from the separatist side on Saturday. Authorities in Russia's Rostov region, which borders eastern Ukraine, declared a state of emergency because of the influx of evacuees. Media reports on Saturday described chaos at some of the camps assigned to accommodate them. Putin ordered the Russian government to offer 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, an amount equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in eastern Ukraine. The separatist regions of Ukraine, like much of the country's east, are majority Russian speaking. Putin on Tuesday repeated allegations of a ""genocide"" there in explaining the need to protect them. One of the evacuees, a Donetsk resident who identified himself only as Vyacheslav, blamed Ukraine's government for his plight. ""Let them calm down,"" he said. ""It's our fault we don't want to speak Ukrainian, is that it?""",4,1.939835199836922,2.1206789825626684,-0.1808437827257463,7

Russia said it was opening an investigation into Russian media reports that a Ukrainian shell exploded near its border, amid U.S. warnings that the Kremlin could stage a violent incident as a pretext for invasion. Russian-backed separatist leaders declared a full military mobilization in the separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk and ordered the evacuation of civilians to Russia. They accused Ukraine of planning an invasion of rebel-held territory, which the Ukrainian government denied. Ukraine's military said two of its soldiers was killed Saturday in the government-held part of the Donetsk region, and that mercenaries had arrived in the area to, in collaboration with Russia's specialist services, stage provocations which could be used to accuse Ukraine of further escalation. ""It defies basic logic to believe the Ukrainians would choose this moment, with well over 150,000 troops arrayed on its border, to escalate a year-long conflict,"" U.S. President Joe Biden said late Friday. ""All these are consistent with the playbook the Russians have used before — to set up a false justification to act against Ukraine."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Germany Saturday morning for a security conference with Western officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris told the conference the U.S. is united with its NATO allies in its support for Ukraine. ""If Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States, together with our allies and partners, will impose significant, and unprecedented economic costs,"" Harris said. ""Russia continues to say it is ready to talk while at the same time it narrows the avenues for diplomacy. Their actions simply do not match their words."" In a televised speech late on Friday, President Biden said that though it is not too late for diplomacy, he believed Putin had made the decision to invade Ukraine, and to target the capital city Kyiv. ""I'm convinced he's made the decision. We have reason to believe that,"" Mr. Biden said. Despite the dire assessment, residents of Kyiv continued with life as usual Saturday. ""We are in a war, so since 2014, we are not afraid actually,"" a therapist who was on her way to work said. ""I have an office just in this building in the city center. For me it's OK to work here."" ""There are other methods to invade, like cutting off the internet, disconnect other resources. This is the 21st century.

""As of this moment, I'm convinced he's made the decision,"" the president told reporters at the White House. ""We have reason to believe that."" The president delivered brief remarks on Ukraine and answered a few questions from reporters Friday afternoon, following a call with Transatlantic leaders about the likelihood of further Russian aggression against Ukraine. Mr. Biden said the U.S. has ""reason to believe the Russian forces are planning to and intend to attack Ukraine in the coming week — in the coming days."" ""To be clear, you are convinced — you are convinced that President Putin is going to invade Ukraine, is that what you just said a few moments ago?"" CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang asked. ""Yes, I did. Yes,"" he responded. Still, the president said that diplomacy remains an option: up until Russia actually invades Ukraine, ""diplomacy is always a possibility,"" Mr. Biden said. The president's remarks came on the heels of the confirmation by U.S. officials that they believe Russia was responsible for cyberattacks on Ukraine that began this week. Mr. Biden said the U.S. also believes Putin will target Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, which is home to 2.8 million people. ""We're calling out Russia's plans loudly and repeatedly, not because we want a conflict, but because we are doing everything in our power to remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving,"" Mr. Biden said Friday. ""Make no mistake. If Russia pursues its plans, it will be responsible for a catastrophic and needless war of choice. The United States and our allies are prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory from any threat to our collective security as well."" According to a defense official, 40-50% of the 150,000 Russian forces arrayed around the Ukrainian border are now in their ""attack positions."" This means they are in their assault formations, anywhere from 5-30 miles from the border just waiting for the order to go. In all, there are 120-125 battalion tactical groups, and the official says the destabilization phase of the operation has begun. A full-scale invasion would be likely to begin with cyber attacks and electronic warfare to take down Ukraine's command-and-control network. This would be followed by air and missile strikes to destroy their key leadership installations. There could be commando raids to assassinate senior government leaders and to seize TV and radio stations. Airborne operations would seize air fields and bridges. Then, the forces at the border would come rolling across in tanks and vehicles to take down the country. Major cities, including the capital of Kyiv, would be targets. The Ukrainian military would try to fight, but they would be quickly reduced to pockets of resistance and last perhaps 10-15 days. The Biden administration has been urging Americans in Ukraine to leave as soon as possible, warning that the U.S. won't send in troops to rescue them if Russia attacks. The president also disputed Russian claims of genocide and aggressive actions on the part of Ukraine. It defies ""basic logic"" that Ukraine would try to escalate a conflict, the president said. ""All these are consistent with the playbook the Russians have used before — to set up a false justification to act against Ukraine,"" he said. — CBS News' Weijia Jiang contributed to this report.",4,2.035727846080039,1.799115750011771,0.23661209606826805,26

2022-02-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-cyber-attacks-white-house/,White House believes Russia responsible for cyberattacks on Ukrainian banks and defense sites,"The White House believes Russia is responsible for recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine's major banks and Ministry of Defense, a top administration official said Friday. Deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger made the attribution at the White House, as tensions escalated between Russia and Ukraine. ""We believe that the Russian government is responsible for widespread cyberattacks on Ukrainian banks this week,"" Neuberger said. ""We have technical information that links the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU. GRU infrastructure was seen transmitting high volumes of communication to Ukraine based IP addresses and domains."" Neuberger noted that the denial of service or ""DDoS"" and spam attack had ""limited impact"" within Ukraine, but said the most recent incident of malicious digital activity could precede ""more disruptive cyberattacks accompanying a potential further invasion of Ukraine's sovereign territory."" The U.S. has shared underlying intelligence with Ukraine and with European partners, Neuberger added. Top cyber officials said the U.S. had worked quickly to connect the dots on the GRU-linked attack in order to ""call out the behavior quickly."" The U.S.' public attribution of the attacks to Russia coincided with a similar announcement by U.K. officials Friday. ""The decision to publicly attribute this incident underlines the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity,"" Britain's Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said in a statement. ""This activity is yet another example of Russia's aggressive acts against Ukraine,"" the statement added. Ukrainian officials called this week's DDoS attacks the worst of their kind in the country's history, despite the unsophisticated tactics behind the cyber harassment. According to data collected by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, internet traffic hitting Ukrainian websites during the DDoS attack was ""three orders of magnitude more than regularly observed traffic,"" according to Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike. John Hultquist, vice president of Intelligence Analysis at cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said it's important not to misjudge the purpose of these attacks. ""The disruption they cause is designed to intimidate and undermine and is not an end unto itself,"" Hultquist said in a statement to CBS News. ""Ultimately, we should not judge these incidents by their technical complexity. Though they turned off the lights in Ukraine, the GRU's most important cyber operation may have been when they hacked and leaked information during the 2016 elections,"" he added. Earlier this week, Under Secretary for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told ""CBS Mornings"" that the Russians were likely behind the attack, citing their past actions. ""Who is best at this, who uses this weapon all around the world? Obviously, the Kremlin,"" Nuland said. ""I think what's most important is that these cyberattacks were not very successful,"" she noted, commending Ukrainian officials for responding quickly and helping the websites recover. Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team or ""CERT"" released a technical analysis of Wednesday's campaign on Ukrainian government agencies and banks on Friday. Ukrainian officials confirmed that the Mirai botnet, malware commonly used in botnets during large-scale network attacks, was employed in these cyberattacks. Neuberger told reporters Friday that there is currently no intelligence suggesting specific or credible cyber threats to the U.S. homeland. Over the past few months and weeks, U.S. cyber officials have redoubled outreach within the private sector, urging the nation's critical infrastructure owners and operators to bolster cyber defenses. ""Given the rising tensions and the potential invasion of Ukraine by Russia, we've actually been leaning forward to inform our industry partners of potential threats,"" Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly said Friday during an Aspen Institute panel. ""It really is part of a paradigm shift that I've been talking about for awhile now — of moving from the government being reactive to being much more proactive."" Easterly noted that outreach included ""classified and unclassified briefings to our private sector and state and local partners regarding evolving cybersecurity risks."" The Treasury Department convened an in-person briefing with CEOs of major U.S. banks, Thursday, alongside officials from the FBI, CISA and White House. Participants included J.P. Morgan and Citibank. On Friday, CISA released an advisory warning critical infrastructure owners and operators of an uptick in sophisticated foreign influence operations employing misinformation, disinformation and mal-information (MDM). Easterly pushed organizations to ""lower their threshold"" for reporting anomalous cyber activity to the U.S. government Friday. ""Just get that information to the government,"" she urged.",20,4.677650458603387,5.154563877418344,-0.47691341881495664,16

The rebel administrations in the two breakaway regions announced plans to evacuate thousands of civilians into neighboring Russia. Western leaders say an escalation in the fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region — which has simmered for almost eight years — could be part of Russian efforts to create a ""false-flag"" pretext to invade. ""Ukraine is not your enemy, but those who want to defend you against Ukraine are. Do not heed rumours about some offensive operation,"" Ukraine's defense minister said in a speech Friday. ""We have no intentions to conduct any force actions towards the ORDLO (Donbas) or the Crimea. At all. We will move by the political and diplomatic way. Because there are our citizens and we will not put them in danger."" The Ukrainian government's reassurance didn't appear to be calming nerves in the rebel-held region, however, with social media photos purporting to show people lining up to take money out of banks. Russian officials seemed to know little about the evacuation plans. Asked if Russia was ready to accept thousands of refugees from Donbas, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday: ""I don't know with whom there were contacts, I don't have information."" The reports came as America's defense chief said the United States had still seen no drawdown of the Russian forces massed around Ukraine's borders. The U.S. envoy to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which was meeting in Germany on Friday, said the Russian deployment around Ukraine's borders had actually swelled to between 169,000 and 190,000 troops — the biggest military buildup in Europe since World War II. ""Although Russia has announced it is moving its forces back to garrison, we have yet to see that. In fact, we see more forces moving into that region, that border region,"" U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said during a press conference alongside his Polish counterpart on Friday. ""We also see them going through, continuing to prepare, by doing things you'd expect elements — military elements — to do as they were preparing to launch an attack."" But Russia continued issuing new claims that some of its soldiers and weapons were returning to their bases after planned military exercises, even as the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin would personally oversee massive naval drills on Saturday involving the country's nuclear forces. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a stark assessment of the situation to the U.N. Security Council, saying Washington believed Russia was planning a full-scale attack on Ukraine. He echoed President Joe Biden's warning that the U.S. believes Russia is trying to manufacture an excuse for war. ""We have reason to believe they are engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in,"" Mr. Biden said. The president is scheduled to host a call on Friday with the leaders of NATO, the European Union, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania. Blinken, meanwhile, was in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris, but his spokesman announced overnight that he is now scheduled to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""late next week,"" unless Russia invades. CBS News correspondent Christina Ruffini, at the OSCE meeting, said Harris was slated to meet during the conference with Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky about the Russian buildup along his country's borders. Ruffini said it was a risky move for Zelensky to leave his country with more than half of Russia's armed forces moving into battle positions around its borders, but he was keen to ensure that other world leaders weren't making decisions that directly affect him in Munich without him in the room. Harris was not meeting with any Russian officials over the several days of the OSCE conference, Ruffini noted, because the Russian delegation opted not to come — knowing they would have been at the center of the wrong kind of attention. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made an urgent plea for deescalation to the gathered leaders at the Munich security conference, CBS News' Pamela Falk reported. ""During much of the Cold War, there were mechanisms that enabled the protagonists to calculate risks and use back-channels to prevent crises,"" Guterres said. Now, ""miscommunication or miscalculation can make a minor incident between powers escalate out of control, causing incalculable harm.""",4,2.7754558213374274,1.1623851493847481,1.6130706719526793,7

Although the European Union is prepared for a possible Russian invasion of its neighbor, the ambassador told CBS News that the continent is hopeful Putin will not move to war. ""We're in a very tense situation, and this hasn't changed,"" Lambrinidis told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on ""Red and Blue"" Wednesday. ""The Russian troops are still there. Even if they have removed a few, which has not been verified, we're talking about over 100,000 troops."" Lambrinidis said he is still hopeful that the tensions can be dealt with via diplomacy. ""For us, this is existential. It must be understood that this is Europe, and Ukraine is in Europe,"" he said. ""And Russia is not just simply threatening Ukraine, but through Ukraine, it is in effect, threatening the right of countries in the 21st century to be free and independent and to make their own decisions. If that kind of broad affair succeeds, then instability and insecurity and the potential for war not just in Europe — in the rest of the world — is going to be much higher."" Ukraine is already being affected by Russia's buildup of troops along its border. The economy is suffering, and Ukraine is seeing large-scale cyberattacks. Residents in the country have their bags packed in case they need to evacuate, according to Lambrinidis. ""This is not the 1940s, this is 2022, and this is just simply unacceptable,"" the ambassador said. If Russia did choose war, he said, it would lead to ""a remarkable violent period for Europe."" ""It's going to cost you both in real economic terms and historically a price that you've never paid in the recent history of Russia,"" he warned. ""It's going to ensure that Europe, which is Russia's neighbor, is going to move away from Russia for a very long time. It's going to ensure that Russia is going to suffer economic consequences that it will have to claw out of, perhaps by seeking alliances around the world that perhaps in normal circumstances it would feel quite uncomfortable in. And it will mean that the Russian people who absolutely have nothing, nothing to be blamed for for the Kremlin's adventurism may also suffer in return and that is something we simply don't want. It's entirely Mr. Putin's decision."" He said Russia's actions have brought European Union member nations closer together, and that they are united in planning massive, coordinated sanctions against the Russian economy and certain individuals. And the ambassador said that should Russia cut them off from its energy supplies, the European Union would be able to make it through the winter without Russia's resources. Putin's actions have also united the European Union and the U.S., which has also agreed to historic sanctions against the country should it invade. Lambrinidis said the coordination between the two has been ""remarkable."" ""We are speaking every day, almost every day, at the highest levels… to nail down all of the consequences that Russia will face,"" he said. As an example, Lambrinidis said that Russia sent a letter to each member of the European Union, and in response, it got one letter from the European Union and one from NATO. ""I think Russia thought it could divide and conquer us, and it has actually united the European Union and NATO more than we have arguably been ever before,"" he said.",4,2.4317522792518673,2.60264460954812,-0.17089233029625284,24

But late in the day, U.S. officials said intelligence shows the opposite, with 7,000 more Russian soldiers arriving on the Ukrainian border. The U.S. believes the window for a potential attack against Ukraine has been extended by another 4-5 days, which means it could come after the Olympics and a key gathering of world leaders in Germany over this weekend, CBS News' Margaret Brennan reported late Wednesday. One U.S. official told Brennan that a provocation could happen at any moment and the ensuing military action may be a few days later. One potential flashpoint is the Donbas region, Brennan reported. Russian propaganda is in overdrive right now, focusing on atrocities in Donbass, which Putin called a genocide. Vice President Kamala Harris will join world leaders in Munich over the weekend, and she will meet with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky and also separately with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, according to senior administration officials. This will be the first engagement between Harris and Zelensky. ""We are in a very decisive moment,"" a senior administration official said on a call with reporters Wednesday night. ""The vice president is leading the U.S. delegation to the Munich Security Conference this year as a resounding signal that engagement with our partners and allies is an absolutely critical part of our overall diplomacy and our approach to this situation."" On Tuesday, the U.S. and its NATO allies met Moscow's initial claims of a pullback with intense skepticism, but they made it clear both sides wanted to continue negotiating for a solution to the standoff between East and West, with Ukraine caught in the middle. President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the U.S. had yet to see any proof of Russia's claims that it was pulling some of the estimated 150,000 forces massed around Ukraine's northern, eastern and southern borders back to their bases. A Russian invasion, he said, ""remains distinctly possible."" On Wednesday, before meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in Brussels, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said not only was there no evidence of a withdrawal, but ""on the contrary, it appears that Russia continues their military build-up."" Meanwhile, the U.S. government has assessed that Russian cyber actors likely have broadly targeted the Ukrainian government, military and critical infrastructure networks to collect intelligence and prepare for disruptive cyber activities, U.S. officials told CBS News on Wednesday. Russia could seek to disrupt Ukraine's energy, transportation, finance and telecommunications sectors, either to support military operations or cause widespread panic in an attempt to destabilize the country, U.S. officials added. But Ukrainian cyber officials told CBS News there is ""no evidence"" that Russian actors have broadly penetrated Ukraine's critical infrastructure. Amid the uncertainty over Putin's actions and intentions, people in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv were keeping calm. But they clearly felt vulnerable as Russia continued massive war games on the Black Sea and in neighboring Belarus, and as cyberattacks continued to derail government and financial websites in the country. Zelensky declared Wednesday ""Unity Day'' — a bid to show strength in the face of Russian attempts to divide his nation, where a war has simmered against Russian-backed separatists in the east for eight years.",4,1.7038927959500065,2.524210431444975,-0.8203176354949684,26

On Thursday, amid the claims of shelling from both sides, NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was ""concerned"" that Russia was trying to do just that. With U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken making an unscheduled stop in New York to address a Security Council meeting requested by Ukraine, a senior State Department official echoed Stoltenberg's concerns about possible Russian preparations to fabricate a pretext for an invasion. The official said it wasn't immediately clear whether the shelling was actually the false-flag incident the U.S. has worried about, but called it ""perhaps the most perilous moment for peace and security since the end of the Cold War."" ""We've said for some time the Russians might do something like this in order to justify a military conflict,"" U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, in Brussels for a NATO meeting, said on Thursday, adding that the allies would ""be watching this very closely."" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas Greenfield told reporters that she had personally asked Blinken to address the Security Council on Thursday ""to convey the gravity of the situation,"" reported CBS News' Pamela Falk. ""The evidence on the ground is that Russia is moving toward an imminent invasion. This is a crucial moment,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""This morning's Council meeting should not distract us from that fact — it should focus on what is happening right now in Ukraine."" The Russian-backed separatists who control two breakaway districts within the Donbas region, Luhansk and Donetsk, claimed on Thursday that Ukrainian forces had opened fire on a number of villages inside their territory, but that they were still checking for casualties. Officials from the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk ""People's Republics"" said Ukrainian security forces ""continue to flagrantly violate the ceasefire regime using heavy weapons."" Ukraine's military said it was the separatists who had violated the ceasefire by shelling government-held villages, including a mortar that hit a kindergarten but caused no casualties. It has long been the policy of the Ukraine's armed forces in Donbas not to respond to provocations from the rebels unless their lives are in immediate danger. On Thursday, Ukraine's military said in a statement that its forces ""took measures"" to respond to the incoming rebel fire, but provided no details. There have been regular skirmishes between the two sides in Donbas since 2014, when Russia last sent in troops to support the rebels, and they have routinely accused each other of violating a ceasefire. Russia's 2014 invasion led to Putin's unilateral annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. Ceasefire agreements signed in 2014 and 2015, known as the Minsk Accords, halted large-scale combat but the war has simmered for almost eight years, leaving 14,000 people dead, according to Ukraine's government. Russia's recent buildup of around 150,000 troops just over the border from the Donbas region in the east, in Belarus to the north and Crimea to the south, which began in the autumn, has sent tensions soaring. Russia claims the surge of forces has always been for military exercises and that it poses no threat to Ukraine or any other nation, but has refused to offer any real explanation for the biggest buildup of military might in Europe since the Cold War. Defense officials in Moscow have said since Tuesday that troops and military hardware are pulling back, having completed some of the drills. Western intelligence officials say, on the contrary, that Russia has moved roughly 7,000 more troops close to the borders in recent days. On Thursday an American official told CBS News that not only were Russian troops moving out of assembly areas, closer to the Ukrainian border and into attack positions, but the Russian units remaining behind had begun fortifying their positions. Satellite imagery shows a recently constructed pontoon bridge over a river in Belarus very near the border, and British officials have said Russia is also building field hospitals on Russian soil near the Ukrainian frontier. President Joe Biden said this week that Putin's forces remain in position to launch an invasion at any time, at short notice, if the Russian leader decides to order one. Mr. Biden, his European counterparts and the G7 have all warned Putin for months that any new invasion of Ukraine would be met with ""swift and severe"" sanctions. Ukraine has aspirations to join NATO but is not a member of the Western military alliance now, and the U.S. and other NATO states have ruled out sending troops in to back up Ukraine's forces directly. The transatlantic partners have made it very clear, however, that if any Russian aggression were to threaten a NATO member — and there are many in the region — they would ""stand united to defend each other."" The U.S. and its allies continue to send more troops and weaponry into Eastern and Northern European NATO states to bolster the alliance's defenses. But American officials told CBS News on Wednesday that the window for a potential Russian attack against Ukraine had been extended by four to five days, suggesting hopes for a diplomatic solution to the crisis had not completely evaporated. More than a week of intense talks have yielded no signs of significant progress, however, and as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said bluntly on Thursday, ""the situation near the borders of Russia can ignite at any moment."" After waiting for weeks for Moscow to respond fully to a number of proposals sent from Washington to the Kremlin in a bid to find anything the two sides can agree on to ease the tension, the Biden administration confirmed on Thursday that it had a formal reply. A State Department official said it was handed to U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan in Moscow. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier that his country would publish its response within hours of delivering it to Washington.

2022-02-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-donbas-luhnask-donetsk-recognition-option/,Russian lawmakers' request for Putin to recognize Ukraine's breakaway regions gives him another card to play,"Kyiv — Russian lawmakers voted on Tuesday to send a formal request to President Vladimir Putin to recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that if Putin were to sign the legislation, it would ""amount to the Russian government's wholesale rejection of its commitments"" under previously negotiated, but never fully implemented peace agreements known as the Minsk Accords. Both the West and Russia have said they view the Minsk Accords, which ended major fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces in Donbas in 2015, as roadmaps to a diplomatic solution to the current crisis. While the war in Donbas was quieted by the agreements, the fighting never completely stopped. Ukraine's government says the grinding conflict has now left at least 14,000 people dead. The appeal to recognize the two breakaway regions, which call themselves the Luhansk People's Republic and the Donetsk People's Republic, is now on Putin's desk. The Russian leader said the overwhelming passage of the legislation by lawmakers in Russia's parliament, the Duma, showed the Russian peoples' empathy for the people of Donbas, but he's given no indication that he'll approve the measure. ""Enactment of this resolution would further undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, constitute a gross violation of international law, call into further question Russia's stated commitment to continue to engage in diplomacy to achieve a peaceful resolution of this crisis, and necessitate a swift and firm response from the United States in full coordination with our Allies and partners,"" Blinken said Wednesday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow, meanwhile, that Putin had said ""the main task is to implement the Minsk package of measures,"" and he added that the Kremlin agreed that recognizing the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk would contradict the Minsk Accords. The Minsk Accords, named for the capital of Belarus where they were signed in 2014 and 2015, aimed to secure a ceasefire between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces fighting in Donetsk and Lunhansk. They set out a path for elections in the two regions, and for their reintegration into Ukraine. Donetsk and Luhansk, which are both largely Russian-speaking rather than Ukrainian-speaking, unilaterally declared independence from Ukraine in 2014. But while Western nations and Russia say they want to pursue diplomacy using the accords as a roadmap, the two sides have different views on what the accords actually mean. The Ukrainian government views the agreements as a way to reunite the country, though the two breakaway regions would be given some devolved powers. Russia sees them as a way to install Moscow-aligned administrations with special powers in the regions before they're reintegrated into Ukraine, which would give Russia significant influence over Ukraine's domestic affairs. While Peskov said the Kremlin's aim is to continue pursuing diplomacy for now, if Putin decides the ongoing diplomacy is no longer working to his favor, he could recognize the breakaway regions to increase pressure on Kyiv without taking direct military action. The U.S. has warned for weeks that Putin's regime might also attempt to stage a so-called false-flag incident — making it look like Ukrainian forces had attacked rebels or even civilians in Donbas and then using that as a pretext to attack Ukraine from the east, as he did in 2014. The Duma's vote on Tuesday has effectively given Putin another card to play, if he wants to use it.",4,1.936721639531328,4.011140878117043,-2.0744192385857154,7
2022-02-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-information-warfare-disinformation-stopfake/,Information warfare expert in Ukraine says the U.S. is finally countering Russia at its own game,"Kyiv, Ukraine — The head of an organization that's battled Russian disinformation in Ukraine since President Vladimir Putin last sent troops into the country in 2014 tells CBS News the United States has finally learned to counter Russia's unique brand of hybrid warfare. ""I believe this is one of the first times when we saw an effective response from Washington and its European partners to this hybrid threat of Russia,"" Ruslan Deynychenko, executive director of the StopFake organization, told CBS News at his Kyiv office. The U.S. and its European partners have aggressively countered Russia's narrative since it started massing forces along Ukraine's borders in recent months. Putin's government has insisted that Russia is merely hosting military exercises that pose no threat to Ukraine or any other nation. Washington and its partners have countered that stance by pointing not only to Russia's recent history of invading Ukraine, but also its consistent use of covert tactics to try to subvert trust in Ukraine's central government and stoke tension in the country's east, where there is significant pro-Russian sentiment. Deynychenko's media organization, which operates a website and runs a television program aired in Ukraine, has spent almost eight years debunking the Russian disinformation spread by its state-run and private media and its army of unofficial internet trolls via social media. StopFake was founded during Russia's invasion of eastern Ukraine, which led to Putin unilaterally annexing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. That landgrab, while portrayed by Russian officials and media as a defense of ethnic Russians in Ukraine's Donbas area, has never been recognized by the West. Kyiv and Washington still consider two breakaway regions in Donbas part of Ukraine, despite pro-Russian rebels' firm control of the ground. StopFake is run by volunteers and journalism students at the Mohyla School of Journalism in Ukraine's capital. ""We wanted to show people, not just regular citizens, but governments, that Russian television, it's not about informing people. It's about using media as a powerful tool to influence people,"" Deynychenko told CBS News. Calling out false information, learning how to interpret it and teaching the general public to do the same, are valuable ways to fight back against disinformation and propaganda, he said. Deynychenko said America should be on guard for similar information warfare in other countries. ""We know that other players, they try to use the same technique. But, very often, the disinformation and these hybrid operations, they are not so open, and you cannot see them. It might be people chatting in the Telegram or WhatsApp groups, and they are not public, but someone can work with them, someone in these groups can persuade them to hate each other, to hate because of a different race, different language they use, different color of skin or different religion or whatever — and to persuade them to kill each other,"" he told CBS News. ""One day, you can wake up in the morning and look through a window and see how people with machine guns are killing each other."" He said it was important for individuals, countries and companies to invest in real journalism and media literacy to counter the threat of disinformation campaigns, and he urged people to be wary of falling into traps set online by those seeking to foment division. ""Remember that someone still pays for even for free content, and the free cheese might be only in the mousetrap,"" Deynychenko said.",4,3.3233460137617197,3.9556003191992835,-0.6322543054375638,29

""This is about more than just Russia and Ukraine — it's about standing for what we believe in,"" Mr. Biden said. Mr. Biden said the U.S. has ""not verified"" Russian claims that it has started a troop drawdown near Ukraine, and U.S. analysts still believe there are 150,000 troops circling the border with Ukraine and Belarus. While the U.S. has ruled out sending troops into Ukraine to defend against a Russian attack, the president warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that the U.S. would take action if Russian forces move into any of the NATO countries surrounding Ukraine, saying ""an attack on NATO is an attack on all of us."" Mr. Biden's address at the White House came after Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that some of their national security and financial sites were under attack by hackers. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry tweeted that its website has likely been hit by a denial-of-service attack, noting that ""an excessive number of requests per second was recorded."" The ministry said that it's working on restoring the website. Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security confirmed reports of the cyberattacks, stating, ""For the last few hours, Privatbank has been under a massive DDoS attack."" Users reported that they were having problems with payments, as well as with the app. Some had trouble logging in, while others could not access their balance or recent transactions, according to the center. Privatbank said that depositors' funds face ""no threat"" — it's just the app that is affected, and financial transactions ""are perform[ing] normally."" Oschadbank's internet banking is down. The center theorized, ""It is possible that the aggressor resorted to the tactics of petty mischief, because by and large, his aggressive plans do not work."" However, it did not blame Putin for the attacks, and it is currently unclear at this time who is behind the attacks. The last significant cyberattack on Ukraine took place in January, and Ukraine's ambassador told CBS News' Margaret Brennan that an invasion by Moscow was likely to be preceded by hacking. ""If Russia decides on a full invasion, then we know that we should expect increased cyberattacks before that,"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told CBS News. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security on Monday held a call to warn law enforcement, military and U.S. infrastructure stakeholders to be prepared for potential Russian cyberattacks that correspond with a possible invasion of Ukraine. — David Martin, Tucker Reals, Olivia Gazis, Eleanor Watson, Nicole Sganga, Kathryn Watson and Caroline Linton contributed to this report.",20,3.6863096021759976,5.298297512974612,-1.6119879107986144,26
2022-02-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-news-nato-us-cautious-optimism-but-confusion/,"""Cautious optimism,"" but confusion over Russia's intentions in Ukraine","Lviv, Ukraine — U.S. officials have reported a dramatic and worrying shift in Russia's readiness for a potential attack on Ukraine over the past 48 hours, and Russia continues making overt shows of force with military drills in the region. But CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports there was a definite change in the tone on Tuesday morning. Russia is talking more about diplomacy, and making a big deal of pulling back what may be just a few tanks and troops from Ukraine's borders. In the city to which the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has moved all its staff and operations, the conflicting information painted a confusing picture. The State Department said the move from capital Kyiv to the western city of Lviv was a temporary relocation prompted by the ongoing buildup of Russian forces at the border. The move came as a U.S. official told CBS News that Russia had moved rocket launchers and long-range artillery into firing positions near Ukraine's border. New satellite images show ground troops moving from staging areas toward combat positions, and newly deployed Russian bombers. Yet the Russian Ministry of Defense released video on Tuesday claiming to show the pullback of some tanks. It said troops were being withdrawn after the conclusion of some military exercises in the border region. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said there was cause for ""cautious optimism"" on Tuesday, but that the alliance had not yet seen any signs of deescalation on the ground. He stressed that in NATO's view, Russia remained poised for a potential attack on Ukraine. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also accused Russia of sending ""mixed signals,"" welcoming what he said were ""signs of a diplomatic opening,"" but warning the latest intelligence was ""still not encouraging."" Johnson said Russian forces were building field hospitals near Ukraine's borders, and more battalions were moving closer to the borders, which he said, ""can only be construed as preparation for an invasion."" Diplomatic efforts continued, meanwhile. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday as Russia insists it wants to keep negotiating. Amid the uncertainty, American IT executive Heath Morrison decided to move his family from Kyiv to Lviv. ""I don't feel a huge amount of anxiety right now,"" he told D'Agata, adding that while he wasn't worried about his personal safety, he did ""worry a lot for Ukraine."" Morrison said his family, and especially his six-year-old son, were a serious consideration, as he was ""certainly worried about his exposure to chaos or anything like that."" ""We've been paying a lot of attention to all of the news and the circumstances in the last several months,"" he told CBS News, explaining that they had decided to move if and when they saw major international organizations starting to pull people out of the Ukrainian capital, ""not to leave, but to get a little further from Kyiv, where we had more options."" If there is a mass exodus of people from Ukraine, including Americans, it's likely they'll head to Lviv. The vibrant city in the country's west is thought — or at least hoped — to be safer than other parts of Ukraine. Crucially, Lviv is also only about an hour's drive from the Polish border. The U.S. has troops based in Poland, which, unlike Ukraine, is a NATO member. D'Agata and his team visited that border and found a typical line of tractor-trailers and a scattering of cars crossing the frontier. In other words, still all quiet on the western front.",4,3.782041013759529,4.596219287356962,-0.8141782735974328,21
2022-02-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/ransomware-gang-says-it-has-hacked-san-francisco-49ers/,Ransomware Gang Says It Has Hacked San Francisco 49ers,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers have been hit by a ransomware attack, with cyber criminals claiming they stole some of the football team's financial data. The ransomware gang BlackByte recently posted some of the purportedly stolen team documents on a dark web site in a file marked ""2020 Invoices."" The gang did not make any of its ransom demands public or specify how much data it had stolen or encrypted. The team, which is among the most valuable and storied franchises in the NFL and lost a close playoff game two week ago, said in a statement Sunday that it recently became aware of a ""network security incident"" that had disrupted some of its corporate IT network systems. The 49ers said they'd notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firms to assist. ""To date, we have no indication that this incident involves systems outside of our corporate network, such as those connected to Levi's Stadium operations or ticket holders,"" the team said in a statement, referencing its home stadium. News of the attack comes two days after the FBI and U.S. Secret Service issued an alert on BlackByte ransomware, saying it had ""compromised multiple US and foreign businesses, including entities in at least three US critical infrastructure sectors"" since November. Ransomware gangs, which hack targets and hold their data hostage through encryption, have caused widespread havoc in the last year with high-profile attacks on the world's largest meat-packing company, the biggest U.S. fuel pipeline and other targets. Western governments have pledged to crack down on the cyber criminals, who operate largely in and around Russia, but have little to show for their efforts. In the past month, ransomware victims have included operators of maritime fuel depots in Belgium and Germany and media outlets in Portugal. A cyberattack on the wireless provider Vodafone in Portugal this past week had all the hallmarks of ransomware, though the company's CEO for Portugal said it received no ransomware demand. BlackByte is a ransomware-as-a-service group. That means it's decentralized, with independent operators developing the malware, hacking into organizations or filling other roles. It's part of a trend of ransomware groups becoming increasing professionalized. A recent report by the FBI, NSA and others said that ransomware operators are even setting up an arbitration system to resolve payment disputes among themselves. Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm Emisoft, said BlackByte's malware, like many ransomware variants, is hardcoded to not encrypt systems that use Russian or languages used by certain Russian allies. But Callow said that doesn't mean whoever is behind the 49ers attack is in Russia or one of its neighbors. ""Anyone can use the malware to launch attacks,"" he said.",20,7.738647070643069,9.886304682592186,-2.1476576119491178,2
2022-02-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/russia-ukraine-news-moscow-says-troops-pulling-back-from-border/,Russia says some troops pulling back from Ukraine border,"Russia's Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that some of the forces the country had massed close to its border with Ukraine over the last four months were being pulled back to their bases, but the U.S. and its allies were in no rush to accept the remarks as an indication that Russia is, in fact, deescalating. The buildup of well over 100,000 troops and a significant portion of Russia's military hardware along Ukraine's borders has drawn increasingly dire warnings from the United States of a possible imminent invasion. The Russian government has always maintained the buildup poses no threat to Ukraine and that its troops would return to their bases after carrying out what Moscow insists are just military exercises. But the biggest buildup of ground forces and war machines in Europe since the Cold War has set off alarm bells for months in the West. Not even 20 hours prior to Moscow's announcement on Tuesday, a U.S. official told CBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin that some of the Russian hardware taking part in the drills had started to move into ""attack positions"" close to the Ukrainian border. U.S. officials have not confirmed any Russian redeployments away from Ukraine's border, but Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told reporters on Tuesday that some units that have been operating for weeks along the country's southwest border with Ukraine, ""having completed their tasks, have already begun loading onto rail and road transport and today they will begin moving to their military garrisons. Individual units will march on their own as part of military columns."" The ministry provided no numbers, and it was unclear exactly where along Russia's long border with Ukraine the movements might be occurring. Russian news agency Interfax cited the country's Southern district command, however, as saying that some forces were being moved from Crimea, the southern peninsula of Ukraine that Russia annexed in 2014, back to bases in southern Russia's Dagestan and North Ossetia regions. If confirmed, the movements could be taken as the first step by Russia to deescalate a crisis that has brought the world closer to a major conflict in Europe than it has been in decades. President Joe Biden has warned that a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine could leave 100,000 civilians dead and fundamentally change the world. The U.S. and its NATO allies have heaped pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin's government to take a step back from the brink of war, threatening a ""swift and severe"" response to any invasion of Ukraine, in the form of international sanctions. After the Russian defense ministry's announcement on Tuesday, Ukraine's foreign minister said his country's diplomatic efforts with the U.S. and European allies had managed to ward off a Russian invasion. ""We and our allies have managed to prevent Russia from any further escalation. It is already the middle of February, and you see that diplomacy is continuing to work,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. He stressed that Russia's claims of a pullback from the borders would have to be verified, however: ""If we see a withdrawal, we will believe in a deescalation,"" he was quoted as saying by the Interfax Ukraine news agency. It was not clear how significant Russia's initial step back from the border — if confirmed at all — would be considered by Washington or NATO. About 30,000 Russian forces are still in Belarus on Ukraine's northwest border for joint drills with Belarusian troops, and they have been operating within 30 miles of the frontier. In total, Russia is believed to have at least 130,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders, according to two sources who spoke to CBS News on Monday, citing information available to them at the time. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said while there was cause for ""cautious optimism"" with diplomacy continuing, the alliance had not yet seen any signs of deescalation on the ground, and he stressed that in NATO's view, Russia remained poised for a potential attack on Ukraine. ""The movement of Russian capabilities doesn't represent real deescalation,"" Stoltenberg said, noting previous shuffling of military assets around on Russian soil. ""What we need to see is significant and enduring withdrawal of forces, troops and the heavy equipment."" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith, speaking to reporters on Tuesday from Brussels, said America and its partners would ""have to verify that and take a look."" ""You may remember in late December, there were some similar claims that came out of Moscow that they were deescalating and in fact, facts on the ground did not support that claim,"" Smith said. ""So we want to make sure we understand what they're talking about when they say deescalation and we want to verify that that is in fact what's happening."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also accused Russia of sending ""mixed signals,"" welcoming what he said were ""signs of a diplomatic opening,"" but warning the latest intelligence was ""still not encouraging."" Johnson said Russian forces were building field hospitals near Ukraine's borders, and more battalions were moving closer to the borders, which he said could ""only be construed as preparation for an invasion."" American officials have warned for weeks that Russia could launch an attack on Ukraine in a variety of ways, including a ground assault from Belarus or Russian soil, a major cyberattack, or a so-called ""false-flag"" attack staged to look like an assault by Ukrainian forces against pro-Russian fighters that Moscow might use as a pretext to launch an invasion. Russia backs separatists in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, where the rebels have fought a simmering war with Ukrainian troops since Putin last sent his forces into Ukraine in 2014, unilaterally annexing the Crimean Peninsula in the process. Earlier on Tuesday, a Russian envoy to the European Union was quoted as saying that Russia would ""respond"" if any Russian ""citizens"" were killed anywhere, including in Donbas. The Kremlin blasted the escalating warnings from Washington about a possible imminent Russian attack on Ukraine as ""dangerous ""hysteria"" on Tuesday, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov mocking the U.S. for suggesting it had knowledge of Moscow's intentions. Peskov asked reporters if the ""exact time of the start of the war"" had been published. Russia was keeping the pressure on, meanwhile. Its parliament passed legislation on Tuesday that calls on the country to formally recognize two regions in Donbas held by pro-Russian rebels as independent from Ukraine. It would be a hugely provocative move and likely lead to an escalation of the nearly-eight-year-old conflict in Donbas, but Peskov said Putin had made no final decisions on whether to back the initiative. Smith, America's NATO ambassador, said Tuesday that if Russia did recognize the breakaway regions, ""I think it's a clear violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity and its sovereignty... so that would obviously be a new shift in in the escalation, and I think we would monitor that very closely."" But the West's diplomatic blitz continued. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, a day after he met in Kyiv with Ukraine's president. Peskov told reporters the negotiations between Putin and Scholz were expected to be lengthy as they discuss ""security guarantees"" and the ""unprecedented tension"" in Europe. Clearly there was hope in Ukraine's capital on Tuesday that the global standoff between the east and west — with the Ukrainian people caught in the middle — had turned a corner. It remained unclear, however, whether Washington would accept Russia's announcement as a step back from the brink of a potentially catastrophic war.

2022-02-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-standoff-what-you-need-to-know-now/,Russia-Ukraine standoff: What you need to know now,"Russia has massed well over 100,000 troops near its own border with Ukraine and in neighboring Belarus, leaving the country surrounded on three sides. The buildup and position of those forces has drawn warnings from the White House that Russian President Vladimir Putin could order an attack ""any time,"" and may well do so before the end of this week. The U.S. has poured military hardware into Ukraine and contributed to a buildup of NATO forces in Eastern Europe in response. Russia and NATO are both carrying out military exercises in the region and demanding that the other party step back first from the brink of war. Along with European partners and the G7, the U.S. has warned that any Russian invasion of Ukraine would bring ""swift and severe costs"" for Moscow, in the form of sanctions. U.S. and European leaders have also warned that a full Russian invasion of Ukraine could result in 100,000 civilian deaths and change the world in fundamental ways. But neither side has abandoned diplomacy yet. Here's what you need to know about the standoff on the border between Russia and the democracies of Europe. The Russian forces have gathered along Ukraine's northern, eastern and southern borders. U.S. officials tell CBS News that Russia now has at least 80% of the forces in place that it would need to launch a full-scale invasion, and that Russia is expected to launch some form of attack against Ukraine by the end of this week. Russia insists it has no intention of invading Ukraine and has dismissed the U.S. warnings as ""hysteria."" The West points to huge Russian military exercises just across Ukraine's borders as evidence of its aggression. NATO and Ukraine have responded by carrying out their own war games close to Russian territory. Russia has said that a massive joint drill it's holding with ally Belarus, on Ukraine's northern border, will end on February 20 and that the 30,000 Russian forces taking part will come home when it's over. But on February 14, a U.S. official told CBS News national security correspondent David Martin that Russian troops near Ukraine's border had begun moving into ""attack positions."" The Russian defense minister said earlier the same day that some of Russia's military exercises in the region had already concluded and that others would wrap up in the coming days. It was a vague statement, and U.S. officials reported no movements of Russian forces away from Ukraine's borders. Secretary Antony Blinken announced Monday the U.S. is temporarily moving embassy operations in Ukraine from Kyiv to Lviv, near the country's western border, due to the ""dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces."" The fear of Russian aggression is based on precedent: Russian forces invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014. Putin claimed the assault was merely a defense of ethnic Russians who live in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, who've never supported the country's relatively new, pro-Western government. But Putin used the invasion to very literally claim part of Ukraine for Russia, unilaterally annexing the Crimean Peninsula. The annexation is not recognized by the international community, but Russia has indisputably controlled the territory since 2014. Since the annexation, a proxy war has simmered in Donbas between Russian-backed forces and the Ukrainian government. A 2015 peace deal largely ended the major battles, but the fighting has continued, and left more than 14,000 people dead in the process, according to the Ukrainian government. Russia's strongman leader speaks often of the ethnic ties between Russia and Ukraine and warns against NATO expanding further eastward toward his borders. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union before declaring its independence in 1991. As CBS News' David Martin reported in January, Putin's objective is to keep Ukraine — the second-largest country on the continent — from making common cause with the democracies of Europe. ""What motivates Putin,"" former NATO Ambassador Ivo Daalder told CBS News, ""is a concern about the independence of Ukraine — a worry that a functioning, successful, prosperous democracy in Ukraine poses a direct threat to his rule, because it will give people in Russia the idea that they, too, could enjoy what Ukraine enjoys, and rise up against his autocratic rule."" To end the current standoff, Putin has demanded that NATO rule out admitting any new members from among the former Soviet states — most importantly, Ukraine — and that NATO forces pull back from positions in other countries near Russia. The U.S. and NATO have rejected the demand to preclude any new members as a non-starter, but they have voiced willingness to negotiate over military deployments and openness with exercises in the region, along with other trust-building measures. The U.S. government is waiting for a formal response from the Kremlin to proposals handed from Washington to Russia weeks ago. Many analysts believe Putin's objective is to erode confidence in Ukraine's government so it can be replaced with a new pro-Russian regime, and that he's using the external threat of military action, along with plausibly deniable actions like cyberattacks, to achieve that. Ukraine has made the quest for NATO membership a cornerstone of its national security policy, and it has refused to back down from that ambition, though even before the current Russian military buildup there was no discussion of Ukraine being admitted to the alliance anytime soon. While many Ukrainians, especially in the country's east, are pro-Russian, Ukrainians ousted their last pro-Russia president in 2014 and have consistently elected pro-Western politicians since. The country has responded to the current standoff by readying its forces to confront any Russian invasion, including with huge shipments of U.S. weapons, civilian defense units and ongoing military exercises near its border with Russian ally Belarus. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged his nation to remain calm, and most Ukrainians — tempered by almost eight years of conflict in the country's east with the Russian-backed separatists — have done so. Despite the White House warnings of a possible imminent invasion, there has been no panic or hysteria, not even stockpiling, in the capital, Kyiv. As Ukraine is not a NATO member, the U.S. and most of its European allies have ruled out sending troops into the country to help defend its territory. Instead, they have provided military hardware, cash, and diplomatic support. President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have held multiple calls with Russian officials, including a phone call between Mr. Biden and Putin on February 13. So far, the direct conversations have yielded no breakthroughs. The U.S. interest in rebuffing Russia's aggression is difficult to explain in terms of goods or American lives: Ukraine is not a significant trading partner, and a threat to its territory or sovereignty poses no direct threat to that of the United States. But the world's most powerful democracies have struggled for years to keep Putin's myriad nefarious actions in check — from claiming Crimea, to poisoning dissidents on British soil and blocking U.N. sanctions against the Assad regime in Syria. As Putin seeks now to deepen Russia's ties with China, another powerful nation eager to portray the Western model of democracy as past its prime, the U.S. has a clear interest in turning back his latest and boldest effort to drive a wedge between NATO members. –Eleanor Watson, Olivia Gazis, David Martin, Ed O'Keefe, Sara Cook, Margaret Brennan and Christina Ruffini contributed reporting.",4,4.415917728481813,1.8400005162729722,2.5759172122088407,17

""They are afraid that something will happen that you can just won't be ready for that,"" said Nataliia Goshylyk, a Fulbright scholar at UC Berkeley. She moved to the East Bay with her husband and children to study at the university. She has a sister, in-laws, and other relatives still in Ukraine. She talks to them daily, sometimes more than once, even with a 10-hour time difference. She says because her family is in the western part of the region, she feels some relief as an attack by Russia would likely be on the country's eastern border. ""People in Ukraine are fearful, they don't know what to expect,"" said Igor Markov, a Mountain View resident who is a member of the nonprofit Nova Ukraine. He has lived in the Bay Area since 2014. ""They don't know what they can do to prepare and I also feel for them."" Nova Ukraine organized the rally on February 6 to show support for the nation as the situation started escalating this year. Markov says the situation is unstable for his family and others back home. He says the situation should also be concerning for people around the world, including in the Bay Area. As a large exporter of important raw materials including neon used for semiconductors, volatility in the region could have a significant economic impact especially as a chip shortage continues. ""The security of the whole world or the whole world's stability is being decided in Ukraine,"" said Dmytro Kushneruk, the Consul General of Ukraine in San Francisco. He is responsible for representing the government in California and many other western states. ""For United States, to help keep stability in Ukraine, in this whole region, means the stability and peace for the world."" Kushneruk said the situation has put Ukrainians at home and abroad on alert since 2014 and the annexation of Crimea by Russia. He says the more than 100,000 Ukrainians in California have closely followed the developments in recent weeks from the media as well as by talking to family still in the country. Lines of communication were strengthened virtually because of the pandemic. ""If people in Russia would see people in Ukraine can be successful democratically they would think why do we have dictator in Russia, we can also have democracy,"" Kushnerruk said. Markov said he hopes that U.S. sanctions will be ready if Russia does invade and he would like to see some sanctions take effect proactively to try to deter a potential attack. ""They're safe right now but we don't know what will happen in three, four days, I very much hope they will be safe,"" Markov said of his family. Nova Ukraine is planning another rally to show support for the country on Sunday outside the Ferry Building in San Francisco at 1 p.m. Ukrainians in the Bay Area like Goshylyk are not only unsure what the situation will be like when she hopes to return home in July but also what the next few days could bring while they watch from afar. ""They will come up with the plan that will satisfy both the safety concerns and the legitimacy concerns of all of the parties,"" she said.",4,5.738747385844226,5.407229971436682,0.3315174144075437,28

The updated guidance, which also tells Americans not to travel to Moldova, comes after a U.S. official told CBS News that Russian units near Ukraine have moved into ""attack positions"" and that the U.S. believes Russia will attack Ukraine by the end of the week. The State Department advisory warned, ""Due to an increase in unusual and concerning Russian military activity near the border with Ukraine, U.S. citizens located in or considering travel to Belarus should be aware that the situation is unpredictable and there is heightened tension in the region."" It's a level 4 advisory, the State Department's most severe ""do not travel"" warning, which indicates an increased likelihood of life-threatening risks. The advisory was already a level 4 before Monday, but the warning to leave immediately is new. In a separate advisory, the State Department also urged Americans in Transnistria — a breakaway region from Moldova — to leave immediately. That advisory warned of potential difficulties at checkpoints along roads leading in and out of the region. The department also said the U.S. government has ""limited ability"" to provide services to Americans traveling there. Though the department did not tell Americans to leave Moldova, it does warn against traveling there, citing ""Russian military activity,"" COVID-19 and the unresolved conflict between Transnistria and the central government. More than 100,000 Russian troops are amassed along Ukraine's borders in both Belarus and Russia. Belarus, Moldova and Transnistria all border Ukraine, though only Belarus also shares a border with Russia. The U.S. warned all Americans in Ukraine to leave last week. Though the U.S. has spent weeks preparing for a potential invasion of Ukraine, it is not yet clear if or when Russia will move forward. However, U.S. officials say Russia has already amassed 80% of the forces it would need to launch a full-scale invasion, with the rest en route. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin could order an invasion ""essentially at any time."" ""We have seen over the course of the past 10 days a dramatic acceleration in the build-up of Russian forces and the disposition of those forces in such a way that they could launch a military action essentially at any time,"" Sullivan said. ""They could do so this coming week, but of course, it still awaits the go-order"" from Putin. — Margaret Brennan and David Martin contributed reporting.",4,1.7640925860477963,4.627536627144472,-2.8634440410966753,26

This is consistent with CBS News' reporting that the U.S. is preparing to withdraw all personnel from Kyiv in the next 24 to 48 hours, according to three sources. ""The path for diplomacy remains available if Russia chooses to engage in good faith,"" Blinken said in a statement Monday. ""We look forward to returning our staff to the embassy as soon as conditions permit."" The U.S. has already ordered all non-emergency employees to leave the U.S. embassy in Kyiv. The U.S. embassy tweeted Saturday morning that the ""continued reports of a Russian build-up on the border with Ukraine indicated ""potential for significant military action."" Consular services at the Kyiv embassy were set to be suspended Sunday. U.S. officials believe Russia could invade and attack as soon as this week. The U.S. has threatened massive economic and political consequences if Russia invades Ukraine, but the pressure hasn't stopped Russia's massive military buildup. U.S. officials say Russia now has 80% of the forces it will need to launch a full-scale invasion, and the rest are en route. More than 100,000 Russian troops are amassed along Ukraine's borders — to the east, in Russia, and the north, in Belarus. National security adviser Jake Sullivan warned Sunday morning on ""Face the Nation"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin could give the orders for an invasion ""essentially at any time."" ""We have seen over the course of the past 10 days a dramatic acceleration in the build-up of Russian forces and the disposition of those forces in such a way that they could launch a military action essentially at any time,"" Sullivan said. ""They could do so this coming week, but of course, it still awaits the go-order"" from Putin. A White House official said Sunday that Sullivan will head to Capitol Hill on Monday morning to brief lawmakers on the latest developments with Russia and Ukraine. He'll brief House leadership and leadership and ranking members on national security-related committees in the morning and then Senate leadership and leadership and ranking members on national security related committees in the afternoon. President Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian readout of their call, Zelenskyy invited Mr. Biden to Ukraine, saying it would send a ""powerful signal and contribute to de-escalation."" Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine understands all current risks and is ready for any developments. ""We will stop any escalation towards Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said, according to the readout. ""The capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, and other cities of our state - Kharkiv and Lviv, Dnipro and Odesa - are safe and under reliable protection."" The White House said that during the call, Mr. Biden reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The White House said that Mr. Biden made clear that the United States would respond ""swiftly and decisively, together with its Allies and partners, to any further Russian aggression against Ukraine."" The two leaders agreed on the importance of continuing to pursue diplomacy and deterrence in response to Russia's military build-up on Ukraine's borders, the White House said. Americans working for the Organization for Security & Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) special monitoring mission to Ukraine were pulled out on Sunday, the US mission to the OSCE confirmed. Those monitors operated throughout the country but were particularly focused on a fragile ceasefire in the east where pro-Russian separatists have been fighting since the 2014 Russian incursion into the area. The U.S. mission to the OSCE warned that those in eastern Ukraine were ""highly exposed"" and added that security conditions — particularly in Russia-occupied Crimea in Russia-controlled eastern Ukraine — could ""deteriorate with little notice."" Russian intelligence has claimed things are happening in the east of Ukraine and especially the Donbas region. Sullivan acknowledged that there is a distinct possibility that Russia may chose that area to launch a false flag attack in order to justify an invasion. ""We also are watching very carefully for the possibility that there is a pretext or a false flag operation to kick off the Russian action in which Russian intelligence services conduct some kind of attack on Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine or on Russian citizens, and then blame it on the Ukrainians,"" Sullivan said Sunday on ""Face the Nation."" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Saturday that 160 members of the Florida National Guard who have been in Ukraine since November — advising and mentoring Ukrainian forces — will be moved ""elsewhere in Europe,"" ""out of an abundance of caution."" The U.S. is deploying additional forces to bolster the American military presence in Eastern Europe. The Pentagon announced on Friday it is sending 3,000 more troops into Poland. They will join the 3,000 others already there and in Romania, to reinforce allies should Putin decide to make a move. The White House says the American military is not going into Ukraine to fight Russia, or even to help evacuations. ""That's a world war, when Americans and Russians start shooting at one another,"" Mr. Biden said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt that aired before the Super Bowl. He said Putin knows not to put American lives at risk. ""I'm hoping that if in fact he's foolish enough to go in, he's smart enough not to in fact do anything that would negatively impact on American citizens,"" he said.

2022-02-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/ransomware-cyber-criminals-say-theyve-hacked-san-francisco-49ers/,Ransomware Cyber Criminals Say They've Hacked San Francisco 49ers,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers have been hit by a ransomware attack, with cyber criminals claiming they stole some of the football team's financial data. The ransomware gang BlackByte recently posted some of the purportedly stolen team documents on a dark web site in a file marked ""2020 Invoices."" The gang did not make any of its ransom demands public or specify how much data it had stolen or encrypted. The team, which is among the most valuable and storied franchises in the NFL and lost a close playoff game two week ago, said in a statement Sunday that it recently became aware of a ""network security incident"" that had disrupted some of its corporate IT network systems. The 49ers said they'd notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firms to assist. ""To date, we have no indication that this incident involves systems outside of our corporate network, such as those connected to Levi's Stadium operations or ticket holders,"" the team said in a statement, referencing its home stadium. News of the attack comes two days after the FBI and U.S. Secret Service issued an alert on BlackByte ransomware, saying it had ""compromised multiple US and foreign businesses, including entities in at least three US critical infrastructure sectors"" since November. Ransomware gangs, which hack targets and hold their data hostage through encryption, have caused widespread havoc in the last year with high-profile attacks on the world's largest meat-packing company, the biggest U.S. fuel pipeline and other targets. Western governments have pledged to crack down on the cyber criminals, who operate largely in and around Russia, but have little to show for their efforts. In the past month, ransomware victims have included operators of maritime fuel depots in Belgium and Germany and media outlets in Portugal. A cyberattack on the wireless provider Vodafone in Portugal this past week had all the hallmarks of ransomware, though the company's CEO for Portugal said it received no ransomware demand. BlackByte is a ransomware-as-a-service group. That means it's decentralized, with independent operators developing the malware, hacking into organizations or filling other roles. It's part of a trend of ransomware groups becoming increasing professionalized. A recent report by the FBI, NSA and others said that ransomware operators are even setting up an arbitration system to resolve payment disputes among themselves. Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm Emisoft, said BlackByte's malware, like many ransomware variants, is hardcoded to not encrypt systems that use Russian or languages used by certain Russian allies. But Callow said that doesn't mean whoever is behind the 49ers attack is in Russia or one of its neighbors. ""Anyone can use the malware to launch attacks,"" he said. © Copyright 2022 Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

2022-02-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-news-us-nato-mount-pressure-on-putin-amid-invasion-fear/,Pressure mounts on Putin as Ukraine crisis reaches a fever pitch,"Kyiv — With more Russian forces gathering along Ukraine's borders and the White House warning that President Vladimir Putin could order an invasion ""any time,"" President Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart agreed over the weekend to continue pursuing diplomacy, but also deterrence. The U.S. is pulling out the few troops it's had in the country, helping train Ukraine's own forces, and all U.S. diplomatic personnel are expected to leave the capital by Tuesday. The personnel movements and the continuing influx of U.S. and other NATO forces to countries near Russia's western borders were a clear sign of the concern in Washington and European capitals that Putin will make a decision to either invade Ukraine, or try to frame Ukraine's forces for an incident that he can use as a pretext for an attack. Mr. Biden and his NATO allies have warned that any Russian invasion of Ukraine would be bring ""swift and severe costs"" for Russia through sanctions. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that the U.S. and its allies were ""watching very carefully for the possibility that there is a pretext or a false flag operation to kick off the Russian action, in which Russian intelligence services conduct some kind of attack on Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine or on Russian citizens, and then blame it on the Ukrainians."" In a phone call on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited Mr. Biden to come to Kyiv, saying it would be a ""powerful signal"" and contribute to efforts to deescalate the crisis. Their call came on the heels of a conversation between Presidents Biden and Putin, which failed to yield any breakthrough. While the White House has stressed that a diplomatic path remains open to Moscow, sources told CBS News on Sunday that the Biden administration was preparing to withdraw all U.S. government personnel from Kyiv by Tuesday. America's NATO allies in Europe continue working to hammer out a diplomatic solution with Moscow. Germany's leader was in Kyiv on Monday to talk with Zelenskyy, before heading to Moscow on Tuesday. Before his meetings, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Putin's government needed to show ""immediate signs"" of deescalation to convince the West that Moscow's repeated denials of any plan to attack Ukraine were unfounded. While refusing to explain its months-long buildup of more than 100,000 troops around Ukraine's borders, however, Putin's government has dismissed the U.S. warnings of an imminent attack as ""hysteria."" The Kremlin has demanded guarantees from NATO that it will not admit new members along his country's western borders — most importantly that Ukraine won't join the Western military alliance. U.S. and NATO leaders have ruled out any such promise, but the Ukrainian ambassador in London sparked a flurry of speculation on Monday by suggesting that his country could agree to at least put its NATO ambitions on hold. Ambassador Vadym Prystaiko's remarks were quickly walked back by both the diplomat himself and his bosses in Kyiv, who stressed the pursuit of NATO membership as a cornerstone of Ukraine's foreign policy. ""NATO membership isn't negotiable,"" Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told CBS News' Pamela Falk on Monday. Even Russia said it didn't see the envoy's initial remarks as a sign of any shift in Ukraine's stance — but the Kremlin spokesman said if Ukraine were to rule out NATO membership, it would go a long way toward easing Russia's own security concerns. Pressure continued to mount on Putin Monday, with the value of Russian stocks and its currency falling as the world's seven most developed economies issued a new admonition to Moscow. ""Our immediate priority is to support efforts to deescalate the situation,"" G7 finance ministers said in a joint statement, warning that if Moscow were to opt for increased military action against Ukraine, they were ""prepared to collectively impose economic and financial sanctions which will have massive and immediate consequences on the Russian economy."" The outcome of the diplomatic blitz could mean life or death for many Ukrainians, but Kyiv remained calm on Tuesday. There was no panic, and little sense that the war against Russian-backed separatists — simmering in the east since Putin's troops last invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014 — was about to erupt into a wider conflict. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports, Ukraine's military is carrying out exercises of its own as Russian troops hold war games around their borders. But Ukraine's forces know they would be vastly outnumbered if Russia were to invade. The Ukrainian government has consistently urged people to remain calm, and life has continued pretty much as normal. But Williams said there was no doubt that being caught in the middle of a standoff between the world's great powers has Ukrainians worried. She visited a farmers' market on Kyiv's John McCain Street — the late American senator is beloved in the country because he pushed the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine to help it battle the Russian-backed separatists in the east. U.S. officials have said a full Russian invasion could cause 100,000 civilian casualties, and shoppers in Kyiv know they would be in the firing line. But Alina Kumbachsia told CBS News that she and other Kyiv residents, ""just live in the moment."" The fitness instructor said nearly eight years of Russian aggression have already made Ukrainians immune to panic. ""We don't know what will be, because this is not our decisions,"" she told Williams. ""We don't want war, we want normal, happy life."" With tens of thousands of forces deployed to Belarus — for joint exercises that Moscow has said will end on February 20 — Ukraine is now close to being encircled by Russian troops. Many of the country's ports are already effectively blockaded, and there's fear that the intimidating Russian military drills just over the borders could be an overture to the Russians moving in. It's thought an invasion could start with cyberattacks, and airstrikes. Kyiv's subway system also serves as the Ukrainian capital's biggest bomb shelter. The capital city's government says it has an evacuation plan, as well as preparations to maintain electricity, heating and communications in case of an attack. Back on John McCain Street, Konstantin Bilotserkivskyi told Williams that he has an emergency bag packed, just in case he has to run from a Russian attack. ""The worst thing, you feel helpless, you know? You cannot impact it anyhow — it's just matter of will it happen or not, and the only thing you can do is wait,"" he told CBS News. The Ukrainian government has demanded an urgent, high-level meeting with Russia by Tuesday, but says Moscow continues to ignore requests to explain why there are more than 100,000 Russian forces massed around Ukraine's borders.",4,5.079979532968821,6.005571966588749,-0.9255924336199284,17

""We have seen over the course of the past 10 days a dramatic acceleration in the build-up of Russian forces and the disposition of those forces in such a way that they could launch a military action essentially at any time,"" Sullivan said in an interview with ""Face the Nation."" ""They could do so this coming week, but of course, it still awaits the go-order"" from Putin. Still, he said the U.S. ""cannot predict the precise day or time"" that Russia might decide to take action. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia have escalated as more than 100,000 Russian forces have amassed along Ukraine's borders, even as the U.S. and Western allies have urged Putin to engage in diplomacy. Despite the continued message of de-escalation, pushed by the Biden administration, the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine has continued to rise, as Russia has 80% of the forces in place that would be needed for a full-scale invasion, a U.S. official told CBS News last week. The State Department on Saturday ordered non-emergency employees at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv to leave the country. Sullivan on Friday urged all U.S. citizens in Ukraine to swiftly leave the country, and warned there is ""no prospect of a U.S. military evacuation"" for those who choose to stay. ""If there is military action, if there is a war between Russia and Ukraine started by a Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Biden is not intending to send in American forces to fight Russia in that war,"" he reiterated Sunday. President Biden spoke with Putin for roughly an hour on Saturday and warned him that the U.S. will ""respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs"" if Russia invades Ukraine. Mr. Biden is also set to speak with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday, a White House official said. Sullivan, who was on the call with Putin, said he couldn't predict what the Russian leader would do, but stressed that U.S. officials would continue to ""test the proposition that we can find a diplomatic path forward."" ""If Russia wants to continue engaging diplomatically to find a way forward to address their security concerns and our security concerns, we're prepared to do that,"" he said. ""If Russia decides instead to take major military action against Ukraine, we're prepared to respond decisively."" In the event Russia invades Ukraine, Sullivan said the U.S. would continue to support Ukraine and said doing so is ""one of the three fundamental elements"" of the Biden administration's response. ""Continue to support Ukraine as it seeks to resist Russian aggression, second, impose severe and swift economic measures sin concert with our allies and partners to go at Russia's financial system and its defense-industrial base, and then third, reinforce, reassure and deter, that is reinforce NATO territory, reassure our allies on the eastern flank and deter Russia from any action against NATO allies,"" he said. Asked about the new alliance between Russia and China, Sullivan said he does not believe China ""will be in a position to compensate Russia for the losses it will endure"" if the U.S. and allies hit Russia with economic sanctions. ""We all have to have a bit more confidence in ourselves, the United States, the West, the leading democracies of the world,"" he said. ""We're more than 50% of the world's economy. China and Russia are less than 20%. We've got innovation, we've got entrepreneurship and yes we've got freedom.""",4,1.0879740793839088,0.9703447493703287,0.11762933001358011,26

The warning comes as U.S. officials say a Russian invasion could begin ""at any time."" With an escalated Russian military buildup on the borders of Ukraine, Mr. Biden emphasized on a phone call with Putin that an invasion ""would produce widespread human suffering and diminish Russia's standing."" ""President Biden was clear with President Putin that while the United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy, in full coordination with our Allies and partners, we are equally prepared for other scenarios,"" the White House said Saturday. The Biden administration has urged American citizens to leave Ukraine and on Saturday, the U.S. Department of State ordered non-emergency employees at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv to leave the country. ""Today, the [State Department] ordered non-emergency U.S. employees at the Embassy to depart due to continued reports of a Russian military build-up on the border with Ukraine, indicating potential for significant military action,"" the embassy tweeted early Saturday morning. Thousands of American troops have been ordered to Poland, where they are expected to be in place by early next week to join 2,000 troops already stationed throughout the region, according to a senior defense official. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Friday that the U.S. is firmly convinced that Russia is looking hard at the creation of a false-flag operation to justify an invasion, ""something that they generate and try to blame on the Ukrainians as a trigger for military action.""

2022-02-12,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russias-false-flag-plan-new-detail/,"New detail about Russian ""false flag"" plan prompts U.S. to prepare for worst in Ukraine","New granular detail about the planning of a false flag attack in Ukraine by Russia was among the intelligence items discussed in the Situation Room on Thursday night in an emergency meeting, U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News. That detail was just part of what two U.S. officials described as a broad mosaic of information that has been building since the fall and which has led to the Biden administration's planning for the worst-case scenario of a multi-axis, simultaneous attack on Ukraine by the Russian military. The Washington Post was the first to report, on Friday, that a false flag operation was among the data points in the new intelligence. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Friday that the U.S. is firmly convinced that Russia is looking hard at the creation of a false-flag operation to justify an invasion, ""something that they generate and try to blame on the Ukrainians as a trigger for military action."" Sullivan said that any subsequent attack would likely begin with ""aerial bombing and missile attacks"" ahead of ""the onslaught of a massive force.""

Last month, U.S. officials said this could involve Russian operatives ""trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia's own proxy forces."" Weather conditions that freeze the ground would allow heavy Russian military equipment including tanks to advance more easily. But ground troops are not the only option that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use. U.S. officials do not have evidence that Putin has decided to deploy these assets to launch an invasion but emphasize that he is now capable of making the decision to execute with very little warning. On Friday, Politico was the first to report that the U.S. had intelligence indicating that Russian military leaders had been told to be ready by February 16. The cumulative picture of Moscow's planning triggered the U.S. on Saturday to pull out U.S. military advisers, withdraw some embassy staff from Kyiv and move staff to a makeshift consular post in Lviv, a city in western Ukraine. Sullivan said Friday that ""prudence demands"" planning — even though the U.S. does not know exactly what is going to happen. Privately, U.S. and Western officials say it is entirely possible that this could be an incredibly dangerous and expensive bluff on Putin's part, but they argue that it is the responsibility of their leaders to weigh the risk. Three Western officials from allied governments expressed skepticism that Putin would take action as extreme as putting 100,000 soldiers on the march and risk a state-on-state conflict, or be willing to take on the occupation of a country that has resisted Russian aggression for the past eight years. Yet all three acknowledged that intelligence indicates the Russian military is definitely planning for that option.

""Today, the [State Department] ordered non-emergency U.S. employees at the Embassy to depart due to continued reports of a Russian military build-up on the border with Ukraine, indicating potential for significant military action,"" the embassy tweeted early Saturday morning. Diplomatic sources told CBS News that embassy evacuations started overnight. But not all of the staff will be leaving the country, Christina Ruffini reports for ""CBS Saturday Morning."" Some will be going to Lviv — a city closer to the Polish border — to provide limited services for Americans who might need them. As of Sunday, consular services at the Kyiv embassy will be suspended. ""U.S. citizens should not travel to Ukraine, and those in Ukraine should depart immediately using commercial or other privately available transportation options,"" said a travel advisory for Ukraine issued on Saturday. The White House is telling all Americans they have less than 24-48 hours to get out. ""If you stay, you are assuming risk, with no guarantee that there will be any other opportunity to leave and there ... no prospect of a U.S. military evacuation,"" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Sullivan repeated warnings Friday that the State Department has issued for weeks. But the message for Americans to leave Ukraine came with a new sense of urgency. ""We obviously cannot predict the future,"" he said. ""We don't know exactly what is going to happen. But the risk is now high enough and the threat is now immediate enough that this is what prudence demands."" The Pentagon press secretary also said Saturday that 160 members of the Florida National Guard who have been in Ukraine since November — advising and mentoring Ukrainian forces — will be moved ""elsewhere in Europe,"" ""out of an abundance of caution."" U.S. officials say Russia now has 80% of the forces it will need to launch a full-scale invasion, and the rest are en route. More than 100,000 Russian troops are amassed along Ukraine's borders — to the east, in Russia, and the north, in Belarus. ""We're in a window when an invasion could begin at any time. And to be clear, that includes during the Olympics,"" said Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The U.S. is deploying additional forces to bolster the American military presence in Eastern Europe. The Pentagon announced on Friday it is sending 3,000 more troops into Poland. They will join the 3,000 others already there and in Romania, to reinforce allies should Putin decide to make a move. The White House says the American military is not going into Ukraine to fight Russia, or even to help evacuations. ""That's a world war, when Americans and Russians start shooting at one another,"" President Biden said in an interview with NBC. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin knows not to put American lives at risk. ""I'm hoping that if in fact he's foolish enough to go in, he's smart enough not to in fact do anything that would negatively impact on American citizens,"" he said. Sources told CBS News about 7,000 Americans have registered with the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, but there could be as many as 30,000 in Ukraine. However, many of them have family members, business interests or homes in Ukraine they might not want to leave. In a phone call Saturday, Secretary of State Blinken spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""to discuss acute and shared concerns that Russia may be considering launching further military aggression against Ukraine in the coming days,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. Blinken told Lavrov that pursuing a diplomatic path to resolve the crisis would require Russia ""to deescalate and engage in good-faith discussions."" According to Price, Blinken also reminded his Russian counterpart that invading Ukraine ""would result in a resolute, massive, and united Transatlantic response."" Mr. Biden and Putin spoke on the phone Saturday morning. No details about their discussion were immediately available.",4,1.3809277972787244,0.7156319055172898,0.6652958917614346,26
2022-02-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-invasion-any-time/,"U.S. says Russian invasion of Ukraine could begin ""at any time""","Russia now has 80% of the forces in place that would be needed to begin a full-scale invasion, compared to 70% exactly a week ago, a U.S. official tells CBS News. The continuing buildup is one reason the Biden administration is now warning an invasion can come within days. ""We continue to see signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House briefing Friday. ""As we've said before, we are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time, should Vladimir Putin decide to order it."" Not every soldier must be in place in order to begin an invasion, or for cyber and air strikes to begin. There are other factors that concern the administration, too: one is the scheduling of live-fire exercises in the Black Sea beginning on February 13. They could serve as a rolling start to an invasion from the south. There is also the rescheduling of a nuclear exercise which usually takes place in the fall but was moved to the middle of February. Amid the growing U.S. concern about the possibility Russia will invade Ukraine, President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be speaking on Saturday morning. The administration is urging Americans still in Ukraine to leave as soon as possible — within 24 to 48 hours at the most. Sullivan would not comment on the details of the U.S. intelligence information but he said of a potential invasion, ""I do want to be clear: It could begin during the Olympics, despite a lot of speculation that it would only happen after the Olympics."" The Winter Olympics, which are being held in China, end on February 20. Sullivan stressed that Americans who remain in Ukraine are at risk, and the U.S. military will not enter the country to extract them, should Russia invade. There are about 7,000 U.S. citizens and green card holders in Ukraine registered with the embassy, but an estimated 23,000 to 30,000 Americans reside there, according to a congressional aide. For weeks, the Biden administration has been asking American citizens to leave Ukraine. The U.S. believes a Russian attack could begin with aerial bombing and missile attacks, followed by a ground invasion of troops. ""The president will not be putting the lives of our men and women in uniform at risk by sending them into a war zone to rescue people who could have left by now, but chose not to,"" Sullivan said. According to the U.S. official, the administration is worried that Americans in Ukraine are not heeding the State Department warnings — which was one of the main reasons Sullivan briefed Friday. This official said that Sullivan's warning to get out within 24-48 hours was meant to impart a sense of urgency; it was not a prediction that a Russian invasion would come within 48 hours. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday ordered 3,000 troops based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to Poland, according to a senior defense official. The troops are expected to leave over the next couple days and be in place by early next week. That's in addition to 2,000 U.S. troops that have already been deployed from the U.S. to the region, as well as troops already stationed in Europe who are being repositioned. President Biden convened a virtual call Friday morning with the leaders of Canada, major European allies, and the heads of NATO and the European Commission to discuss concerns that Russia continues to mass troops and military equipment around Ukraine. While the leaders have universally objected to Putin's military buildup, their views differ on what Putin's intentions are. Russia has insisted it won't start a war, but at the same time, it won't allow its interests to be ignored. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Mark Milley spoke by phone Friday with his Russian counterpart Chief of Russian General Staff General Valery Gerasimov, the Pentagon said in a statement, though it declined to share any of the contents of their conversation. Late Thursday, President Biden convened a Situation Room meeting to discuss the Russian military deployments with top security advisers, according to people familiar with the meeting. Also on Thursday, Mr. Biden used an NBC News interview to warn Americans in Ukraine to ""leave now."" ""We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly,"" the president said. The flurry of diplomatic activity comes as Russia has deployed six warships to the Black Sea, restricting, if not completely cutting off Ukraine's naval access and increasing the number of Russian forces now encompassing the former Soviet republic. — CBS News' Christina Ruffini, Eleanor Watson and Kathryn Watson contributed to this report",4,1.4974807809417752,1.564460357564736,-0.06697957662296083,26

""There are continued reports of a Russian military build-up on the border with Ukraine, indicating potential for significant military action against Ukraine,"" said the advisory. ""The security conditions, particularly along Ukraine's borders, in Russia-occupied Crimea, and in Russia-controlled eastern Ukraine, are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice."" The State Department warned that the government would not be able to evacuate Americans if Russia invades and urged for Americans in the country to come up with contingency plans that do not rely on assistance from the U.S. government. ""American citizens should leave now,"" President Biden told NBC News on Thursday. ""It's not like we're dealing with a terrorist organization. We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly."" In January, the State Department authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. direct hire employees and ordered the departure of eligible family members from the embassy in Kyiv. The warning cited Crimea and areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as areas of increased risk .U.S. government officials are prohibited from traveling in Russia-occupied Crimea, citing that ""authorities continue to abuse and arbitrarily imprison foreigners and the local population."" Tensions are high in the region with Russia amassing more than 100,00 troops surrounding the border of Ukraine. The Pentagon believes Russia now has 70% of the forces in place to mount a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. If Russia invades, it would be the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. Russia on Thursday kicked off military exercises with Belarus along the Ukrainian border, leading to NATO increasing its own forces in the region. CBS News has confirmed that the U.S. government has plans in place to evacuate the thousands of Americans living in Ukraine — if it needs to do so — to neighboring Poland, a NATO ally to which the U.S. has recently deployed additional troops.

2022-02-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-news-war-games-belarus-nato-warns-putin-against-invasion/,Russia kicks off huge war games just over Ukraine's border in Belarus,"Zhytomyr Oblast, northern Ukraine — Russia kicked off huge joint military exercises on Thursday in Belarus, an ally and neighbor that also shares a border with Ukraine. The war games — which Moscow has said will last for 10 days, after which the Russian forces will leave Belarus and return to Russia — have prompted the U.S. and NATO to bolster their forces in the region and carry out their own military drills. The tens of thousands of troops and weapons that Russia has sent into Belarus for the exercises are just one element of Russia's months-long military buildup around Ukraine's borders. The U.S. government says President Vladimir Putin now has more than 100,000 troops positioned around Ukraine's southern, eastern and northern borders, and that he could decide to order a new invasion of the neighboring country any time. Russia insists it has no plans to attack Ukraine, but an intensive diplomacy effort by the U.S. and its NATO partners with Moscow this week has failed to yield any signs of deescalation. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on Thursday that it was ""a dangerous moment for European security,"" saying that as the ""number of Russian forces is going up, the warning time for a possible attack is going down."" Stoltenberg spoke on Thursday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and the State Department said they had ""discussed diplomatic efforts to urge Russia to de-escalate and engage in meaningful and reciprocal dialogue, as well as United States and Allies' force posture adjustments to fortify the Alliance's Eastern Flank."" CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab was on the Ukrainian side of a border crossing with Belarus on Thursday, just a few dozen miles from where the Russian forces and their allies are holding the military drills — the largest in the country since the Cold War. Despite the Russian insistence earlier this week that its troop presence in Belarus was to last just 10 days, the fear is that Putin's deployment of roughly 30,000 troops to the country could be the first step to an invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin has consistently denied any plans to invade, however, and Oleksiy Danilov, Ukraine's top security official, says his country is not panicked, but it is ready for anything. ""The Russians may use Belarus as a ground for provocation,"" he told Tyab. ""It could happen at any moment."" Ukraine announced this week that its own forces would carry out exercises in response to the Russian-Belorusian drills, during exactly the same time frame. The specter of war has set alarm bells ringing across the world. CBS News has confirmed that the U.S. government has plans in place to evacuate the thousands of Americans living in Ukraine — if it needs to do so — to neighboring Poland, a NATO ally to which the U.S. has recently deployed additional troops. In what he called a reaction to the U.S. and NATO's actions Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters on Thursday that Moscow might evacuate its non-essential diplomatic staff from Kyiv. The U.S. has urged American nationals in Ukraine to leave for more than a week, citing the possibility of a Russian invasion, and in January the State Department ordered the families of U.S embassy employees in Kyiv to leave the country. Lavrov suggested it was the West's actions — which include NATO's military buildup in response to the Russian troops around Ukraine, ongoing NATO military exercises close to Russia's borders, urging Western citizens to leave Ukraine and the repeated warnings of a possible imminent Russian invasion — that represent the real threat, to Russia. ""Maybe it is the Anglo-Saxons who are preparing something, if they are evacuating their employees?"" the veteran Russian diplomat told reporters after a seemingly fruitless meeting with his British counterpart Liz Truss on Thursday. ""We looked at their actions and, probably, we will also advise non-essential personnel of our diplomatic institutions to go home for a while. I don't know what our Anglo-Saxon colleagues are plotting."" ""We do not want to threaten anyone,"" Lavrov said. ""Take a look at the public statements: no threats have ever been made. It's we who are being threatened."" U.S. and European officials continue to say they're unsure whether Putin has decided to launch an invasion, or any other level of attack, against Ukraine. But Russia did invade its neighbor eight years ago, annexing Crimea and sparking a simmering conflict in the east of Ukraine between the country's forces and Russian-backed separatists that continues today, and that Kyiv says has left more than 14,000 people dead. After her meeting with Lavrov, Britain's top diplomat Truss said the Russian had repeated his insistence that Moscow has no plans to invade Ukraine, but she said, ""We need to see those words followed up by actions, and we need to see the troops and the equipment that is stationed on the Ukraine border moved elsewhere, because at present it is in a very threatening posture."" Lavrov dismissed his meeting with the British diplomat as pointless, likening it to ""a conversation between the mute and the deaf — when [a person] seems to be listening, but they do not hear."" Despite the apparent failure of politicians to find ant common ground to ease the tension, not all Americans in the country are ready to leave yet, however. Brian Best has lived in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv for more than two decades. It's where he met his wife and is raising his two children. He told CBS News that Ukraine had become ""part of who I am. It's part of my identity,"" and unless bullets start flying in Kyiv, that's where he'll stay. ""We're staying, and certainly our Ukrainian community, they're feeling quite nationalistic right now, you know, calm, calculated… But all of them seem quite confident that this will pass,"" he said. He suspects Putin is playing for concessions from the West, not a war with it. ""I also believe that the U.S. was quick to heighten the rhetoric, and I think that that was probably a good thing because we needed to shine the spotlight on what Russia is doing,"" said West. ""It's not the Ukrainian military that's on the border of Russia, it's the Russian military that's on the border of Ukraine. So, if anyone is the aggressor, it's Russia."" ""This is a peaceful country,"" West told CBS News of his adopted homeland. ""They want sovereignty."" That sentiment is shared by so many Ukrainians, who've told CBS News that if Russia does invade, not only will they stay put, they'll fight back.",4,1.261755337807618,0.7668753602868003,0.4948799775208178,17

French President Emmanuel Macron met Ukraine's president on Tuesday after flying to Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin. Macron said the standoff with Russia could go on for ""weeks and months."" Amid the flurry of diplomacy, NATO has bolstered its presence in countries around Ukraine, and the Western military alliance is holding war games hoping to deter a Russian attack. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata watched on Tuesday as British and Estonian tanks squared off against each other in a simulated battle on a snowy wasteland in northern Estonia, not far from the Russian border. The military exercise is a direct response to Russia's massive military buildup on three sides of Ukraine, which has sent jitters through the entire region. As Russia prepares to kick off huge combat exercises of its own at land and at sea, the NATO war games have never felt more real, or more urgent. If a wider conflict were to break out on the far eastern edge of Europe's democracies, the conditions at the NATO training ground in Läsna, Estonia are exactly what troops would encounter: Deep snow and difficult terrain, with limited visibility. They would also face an enemy that far outnumbers NATO's forces, in both troops and weaponry. Estonia and the other Baltic states, Latvia and Lithuania, sit right along the borders of Russia and its ally Belarus. Each of the three nations is home to a multinational NATO battlegroup. American reinforcements have been deployed to Lithuania, Poland and Romania, while Moscow has sent tens of thousands of forces to Belarus to carry out drills as part of Russia's own military buildup. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said at a news conference on Wednesday that his country would ""be talking to the U.S. to make sure that the rotational U.S. forces would be in Lithuania permanently."" ""That would be the best boost to security and deterrence that NATO could provide, not only to Lithuania, but to the whole region,"" he said. There is still hope for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine. Moscow on Wednesday indicated that Putin's government was still determining how to respond to U.S. proposals to ease the tension, but deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov said the Kremlin had at least ""taken seriously"" the ideas presented. But while the negotiations continue, so do the war games, because military preparations are never based on a best-case scenario.",4,1.5228287368377602,0.8408989158895097,0.6819298209482505,17

With more than 100,000 Russian forces positioned around Ukraine's borders and the U.S. warning that President Vladimir Putin could order an invasion any time, Mr. Biden and his German counterpart tried to show a united front on Monday amid concerns that Europe's biggest economy isn't confronting Moscow as forcefully as it could. Mr. Biden hosted German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House, while Putin met for five hours behind closed doors in Moscow with French President Emmanuel Macron. With additional U.S. troops and weaponry deploying to Eastern Europe, close to Russia's border, President Biden warned Americans in Ukraine to get out, saying he would ""hate to see them get caught in the crossfire."" As CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe reports, Mr. Biden made the remark alongside Scholz, as the leaders insisted their countries were in agreement about the consequences Putin should face if he orders an invasion of Ukraine. ""He would pay a heavy price,"" Mr. Biden said. Germany has been less aggressive than other NATO allies in warning Russia against an invasion — which the Russian leader has consistently denied any plans of launching. A major sticking point for Germany is Nord Stream 2, a more than 750-mile natural gas pipeline being built between Germany and Russia. Europe relies on Russia for a third of its natural gas supply, and if and when the pipeline is opened up, it's estimated that tens of billions of dollars in gas revenue will flow back into Russia. On Monday, Mr. Biden said unequivocally that if there's a Russian invasion of Ukraine, ""there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2… we will bring an end to it."" Scholz didn't go as far, saying only that NATO would be united in its response to any Russian invasion, but Mr. Biden insisted the U.S. and its allies were ""not taking different steps, we will do the same steps."" So far, the warnings from the West and the influx of NATO forces to countries in what Putin considers his backyard have failed to persuade the Russian leader to pull back his troops. Instead, Putin's government announced on Monday that it will hold 10-day joint military exercises in Belarus, a Russian ally that sits on Ukraine's northern border. Satellite imagery released over the weekend shows Russian and Belarusian troops and weapons, including attack aircraft, positioned within 30 miles of Ukrainian soil. Six Russian warships were on their way to the Black Sea, Russian officials said on Tuesday, to take part in sweeping naval exercises that Moscow announced in January. The drills are to involve every Russian naval fleet, from the Atlantic to the Pacific virtually everywhere in-between. The Pentagon believes Putin now has in place at least 70% of the forces he would need to launch a full-scale land invasion of Ukraine. Putin's military deployment around Ukraine is ""well north of 100,000, and it continues to grow,"" Defense Department spokesman John Kirby said on Monday. Ukraine, reacting to the Russian exercises in Belarus, said on Tuesday that it would carry out its own military drills during the exact same timeframe. More U.S. troops and machinery arrived in Poland, meanwhile, as part of American efforts to bolster the defenses of NATO allies around Ukraine. Ukraine, an American partner, is not a member of the transatlantic military alliance, and the White House has said no American forces will be deployed there. The specter of simultaneous war games on either side of Ukraine's borders, as both Russia and NATO continue bolstering their forces in the region, highlights the urgency of efforts to find a diplomatic solution. After his long meeting on Monday with the French leader, Putin indicated that he was prepared to continue negotiations to prevent the crisis from spiraling into a full-on war with Ukraine. He said President Macron had presented proposals to deescalate the crisis that could at least create ""a foundation for our further steps."" The Russian leader again denied any intention of invading Ukraine, and he agreed to have a call with Macron on Tuesday after the French leader visits Kyiv. Macron said on Tuesday that he believed his meeting with Putin would help to prevent a further escalation of the crisis, but the Kremlin quickly shot down reports that the Russian leader had agreed to refrain from further military exercises in the region. Putin's spokesman, however, did appear on Tuesday to try to ease any concerns that the thousands of Russian forces deployed to Belarus in recent weeks for the military exercises might remain there. ""No one ever said that Russian troops would remain on the territory of Belarus, there was no talk of this,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""We are talking about allied exercises, and it is understood that after these exercises are completed, the troops will return to their permanent locations."" As U.S. and European leaders and military commanders try to read the clues from Moscow about Putin's next step, Russian military analyst Alexander Baunov told CBS News foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tyab that in some ways, Putin is using the mere threat of military action to get what he wants: World powers negotiating amongst themselves over his security demands to prevent war. ""The fear of the war is a working political instrument,"" Baunov told CBS News, to ""make Russian demands and Russian concerns to be listened to."" The inherent risk in this coercive form of diplomacy, Tyab noted, is if Russia doesn't gain something, and soon, Putin may decide he has to use force to avoid looking weak.",4,0.8088879684894975,1.3863254199341106,-0.5774374514446131,7

Russia and its own ally Belarus, which sits just north of Ukraine, have announced 10-day joint military exercises to kick off on February 10, aimed, they say, at training forces to repel any attack on Belarus' southern border. Satellite images released over the weekend by Maxar Technologies show Russian and Belarusian forces now positioned only about 30 miles from Ukrainian soil. The images show troops deployed at three locations, armed with missiles, multiple rocket launchers and attack aircraft. As CBS News foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tyab reports, the U.S. and its European allies have issued increasingly dire warnings that the imagery and other intelligence indicates Russia could invade Ukraine any day. Moscow insists it has no plans to do so and accuses the West of stoking the tension on the far eastern border of Europe. Russian officials point to NATO's own buildup of forces in the region and accuse the U.S. of ignoring the Kremlin's demands for ""security guarantees"" from the transatlantic military alliance. Over the last 24 hours, dozens of elite American airborne troops arrived in Poland — part of efforts to bolster NATO's defenses. It was just the latest influx of U.S. troops and military hardware to the region. As NATO and Russia trade blame and gather their respective forces, Ukraine is caught in the middle. Tyab met a group of civilians training near Ukraine's capital of Kyiv to use automatic weapons. They're not soldiers, but they're using real guns and real bullets to prepare for a possible war with a very real adversary. Whether Russia will actually invade is still anyone's guess, but those who came to get trained up were preparing for the worst, and they were being taught by people who already have experience in the fight. Military veterans who've spent years fighting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine have been instructing the urban fighters-in-the-making. Tyab asked a Ukrainian sergeant leading one of the training sessions if it was terrifying to have so many Russian forces and so much Russian weaponry right on his country's doorstep. ""It's not too terrifying for us, because we fight already for eight years, you know? War every day, from 2014,"" he replied, referring to the last time Putin sent troops over Ukraine's border, unilaterally annexing the Crimean Peninsula in the process. U.S. intelligence officials have warned that a Russian invasion could result in up to 100,000 civilian deaths. But many Ukrainians remain unconvinced that Putin will attack. On newscasts across Ukraine, there's barely a mention of the tension along the country's borders. Instead, the top stories over the last day or so have been about a supermarket scandal, and Ukraine's fashion week. ""I don't believe in big invasion right now. It's actually not in the interest of Putin,"" former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told CBS News. ""What Putin needs now is to raise the stakes, to ratchet up pressure."" That, he has done, and the pressure has brought a flurry of international diplomacy as world leaders seek an end to the conflict that doesn't involve bloodshed. French President Emmanuel Macron was meeting Putin in Moscow on Monday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov played down hopes of any major breakthrough ahead of the sit-down, calling the standoff ""too complicated to expect any decisive changes in the course of one meeting."" But noting that France currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, Peskov called it a ""very important meeting,"" and urged the world to wait and see how both Macron and Putin assessed it. In Washington, meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was to sit down with President Joe Biden at the White House, before heading straight back to Berlin to confer with Macron and Poland's leader on Tuesday.",4,0.8894623972945984,1.5614783120221098,-0.6720159147275114,21

Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya tells CBS News that his country has ""full trust"" in the U.S. and is consulting closely with Washington as the Biden administration negotiates with Russia to de-escalate the crisis. President Biden has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin could order an invasion of Ukraine at any time, and his administration alleged on Thursday that Moscow is already plotting to stage a fake video that it could use as a pretext to invade. Russia insists that it has no intention of attacking Ukraine and accuses the U.S. and NATO of stoking the tension by refusing to accept Moscow's demands for ""security guarantees"" from the Western alliance. But Kyslytsya told CBS News that Putin is determined to reclaim Ukraine as pro-Russian ground, by force if necessary, and he said his country is in lockstep with the U.S. Kyslytsya said he is grateful for American support in trying to prevent what he said would be ""absolute bloodshed"" in his country if Russia invades. Below are excerpts of Kyslytsya's interview with CBS News: CBS News' Pamela Falk, on the proposals sent from Washington to Russia to ease the standoff: Is this an agreement that works for Ukraine? Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya: We saw the draft answer before the draft answer was sent to the Russians and we operate in a daily close coordination, operation with the Americans… We have full trust in what the Americans do so far. We very much appreciate their willingness to discuss with us their ideas and their steps. Falk: Do you think Ukrainian civilians are prepared to fight the Russians if they do come in? Ambassador: Absolutely, I have no doubt whatsoever. And that is the level of determination of the Ukrainian nation to defend their independence. It is incredible. Falk: What does that look like for Ukrainian civilians to be fighting one of the most powerful armies in the world? Ambassador: It would be total bloodshed… The Ukrainians want to be in NATO. Before 2014, they were already very pro-European Union… At that moment and before 2014, there was no majority. If you polled the nation, we wouldn't have more than 50% of Ukrainians in favor of the NATO membership. Now, we have very high figures of Ukrainians if they ask if they want to be in NATO. Because now they realize that trying to defend ourselves on our own is not only questionable from the military point of view, but it is also exceptionally expensive economically and financially. Falk: What do you believe Putin wants? Ambassador: He wants to restore the Russian empire no matter how it's called, to the new Soviet Union, the Russian empire, the new Federation, whatever. He wants to be in the book of history as a state leader who restored the empire, no matter how they will call it.",4,1.4396167664498036,1.76998670871563,-0.3303699422658264,21
2022-02-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-disinformation-video-ukraine-invasion-united-states/,"Russia plotted to use fake video as pretense for Ukraine invasion, U.S. reveals","The U.S. has revealed new intelligence of a Russian plot to use a phony video as a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. Senior administration officials said Thursday that the U.S. believes Russia has already recruited players to stage a propaganda video depicting ""graphic scenes of a staged false explosion with corpses, actors depicting mourners, and images of destroyed locations and military equipment."" The White House publicized the Kremlin's alleged plans to fabricate an attack Thursday, in the hopes it would dissuade Moscow from going through with its latest disinformation effort. ""We have made a decision — a strategic decision — to call out disinformation when we see it,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing with reporters, last week. ""We are much more cognizant of the Russian disinformation machine than we were in 2014,"" Psaki added. ""Russia has a boundless capacity to misrepresent truth and what it's doing."" The Biden administration has been redoubling its counterattacks against Russia's disinformation machine, reacting quickly to the storylines Moscow is churning out to undermine trust in Western democracy. U.S. officials registered a record-breaking number of efforts by Russian state media and proxies to push out anti-American and anti-Ukrainian content online, even as the Kremlin continues to threaten Ukraine by massing troops and equipment along the border. In another example of Russia's online malign influence campaign, self-declared ""Russian federal news agency"" Avia.pro published an article on January 23, claiming, ""the United States has begun moving its heavy tanks and light armored vehicles to the border with Ukraine, apparently preparing to use these vehicles to attack Russia."" While Avia.pro is geolocated in the Netherlands, open-source data indicates the domain is registered to a private address of an apartment building in Moscow, Russia, according to fact-checking website StopFake.org. Researchers at the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis have sorted through an avalanche of disinformation produced by Russian state media groups —including state media RT and Sputnik — that claim Russia has no intent to invade Ukraine and that the West fabricated the invasion story as an excuse for its own military buildup. DHS warned state and law enforcement partners this week that ""from September 2021 to January 2022, Russian state media and proxy websites published a greater number of anti-Ukrainian and anti-American narratives on a month-by-month basis than during any preceding period,"" going back to World War II. ""Ukraine-focused article production by Russian media outlets"" surpassed 800 in January 2022, according to the DHS bulletin published Monday and obtained by CBS News. Researchers noted reactionary jumps in derogatory stories about the United States, NATO and its allies on December 7, following the video conference between President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, then again on January 10 at the start of negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland. Recently, Moscow's online armies have spun out wild tales of disinformation accusing the U.S. of hiring mercenaries to carry out a chemical attack plot and revisiting false narratives aligning Ukrainians with Nazism. ""Disinformation is a significant threat,"" deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told reporters Wednesday, during her diplomatic mission to Brussels. ""The disinformation narrative is that Ukraine is the source of the crisis. That is not the case — Russia is the source of the crisis,"" Neuberger stressed. Russia is also perpetuating the lie that there are ""significant NATO forces in Ukraine, significant threats in Ukraine to Russia, Neuberger added. ""That is not the case."" She reiterated that Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border. Propaganda is flooding Telegram channels, according to the Ukrainian Crisis Media Center, a non-governmental organization backed by supporters of Ukraine's sovereignty. The group took note of one recently hatched claim that Ukraine and NATO are plotting an undercover operation code named ""Crushing Sword."" That story, initially posted on the telegram account of Yan Leshchenko, self-proclaimed military leader of the so-called Luhansk People's Republic, and circulated by Russian state media, uses bogus footage of Ukrainian aggression as a pretext for Russian military deployment. While many messages are posted anonymously, others on Telegram connect to pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians such as Yevheniy Muraiev, the owner of ""NASH"" TV channel and one of Moscow's chosen candidates for pro-Russian leadership, according to recent British intelligence reports concluding Putin plans to install a puppet government in Kyiv. The White House dispatched its top cybersecurity official to NATO, Tuesday, to organize its mission to detect and deflect Russian cyberattacks – both against Ukraine, as well as possible retaliatory cyberattacks against Europe and the U.S. Neuberger equated Russia's use of cyber with ""a kind of kinetic operations"" intended to destabilize a target population and government. ""The goal of Russian disinformation is to… shake confidence in a country's government or to make it difficult to assess a situation."" Cyber criminals attempted to ""shake confidence"" in Ukraine last month, targeting more than 90 websites linked to 22 Ukrainian government organizations on January 14 in a three-pronged operation intent on driving Russia's state-sponsored story, according to top Ukrainian cyber official Victor Zhora. Approximately 50 websites were defaced with a ""much smaller number of organizations and IT infrastructures"" suffering damage. ""Some external IT infrastructures were destroyed,"" the deputy chairman of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine told CBS News. Hackers successfully employed specially designed ""wiper malware"" on two of Ukraine's government agencies, but there is no indication that personal information has been compromised. And while the Ukrainian government has yet to formally attribute the attacks to Moscow, the investigation points to familiar Russian tactics. ""It's a part of hybrid warfare against Ukraine. Cyberspace is just one of its areas of warfare,"" said Zhora, who believes that the investigation would benefit from international experts. ""We consider this to be a psychological operation against Ukraine,"" Zhora said. ""It's about seeding chaos and instability,"" he added. Ukrainian government websites, including the homepage for the Foreign Ministry, temporarily displayed a message warning Ukraine's people to ""be afraid and expect the worst."" But in some ways, officials had expected far worse. ""Fifty websites defaced and some data loss isn't a big deal."" Zhora said, pausing. ""It's serious. It's a good lesson for all of us. It's one more hit in a series of cyber attacks, but we showed that our security cyber security system is working."" The State Department issued a fact sheet last month, highlighting five themes Russia has been trying to refine and peddle in its disinformation campaign to rationalize its own actions in Ukraine. For one, there's ""Russophobia"" — falsely portraying Russia as an 'innocent victim' of U.S. aggression, downplaying the Soviet's alliance with Hitler during WWII and portraying the collapse of Western societies as ""imminent."" ""Disinformation has been part of Russian military doctrine for more than a decade,"" said James Lewis, a researcher and tech expert at CSIS. ""The one thing Russians have learned is if you tell a falsehood often enough, there'll be people who believe it."" Lewis says that lesson learned was reinforced back in 2016, when Kremlin-backed trolls revamped their 'classic playbook' with an online disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about the presidential election. The result culminated in a massive network of fake social media accounts or 'bots' programmed to spread divisive political content across the internet that would further exacerbate existing rifts in American society. But Russian meddling in U.S. elections — surfacing again for a bite in 2020 — offered up its share of hard-earned lessons to U.S. officials, too. Experts tracking Kremlin-backed information warfare have welcomed the administration's approach to combating Russia's disinformation campaign, along with efforts by social media companies to curb fake news at its source. ""One thing that's improved in recent years is that the social media companies have gone from saying, 'Oh, we're just, we're just a bulletin board….' to making a much more aggressive effort to weed out fake information,"" Lewis said. ""The Russians create hundreds of bogus individuals, using artificial intelligence to tweet out nonsense. But there's a much stronger effort to expose that.""

But after requests from Ukraine's own leader to tone down the rhetoric, the White House is no longer talking about an ""imminent"" threat of Russian troops crossing the border. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin's government again pointed the finger at Washington, accusing Mr. Biden of escalating the situation by announcing plans to send about 3,000 American troops into Eastern Europe. ""The Americans continue to do this,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""We are talking not just about provocative statements that 'war will come soon, everyone will pay a terrible price,' and so on. We are talking about sending American soldiers to European countries near our borders. Obviously, these are not the steps that are aimed at de-escalating tensions, but, on the contrary, these are actions that lead to an increase in this tension."" But it was Russia that first sent tens of thousands of its forces to conduct exercises near Ukraine's borders, and as satellite images released this week show, that buildup continues not only on Russian soil just east of Ukraine, but in Belarus to the north. CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams was on the Ukrainian side of that border this week, and for the time being, she found it quiet. Williams and her team saw a snowplow, but no war machines. But the Ukrainian forces holding the front line — in what for them has already been an active war with Russian-backed separatists for eight years — told Williams that if Russia does attack, they're ready. The soldiers told CBS News that Russian forces were only about 60 miles away from their section of the border. On the other side, some of the roughly 100,000 Russian troops that Putin has sent from their bases deeper in Russian territory to the border region, and the new satellite images appear to show them closer to battle readiness. ""It certainly has all the image of an army ready to go,"" Russia expert Justin Bronk, a military analyst at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told CBS News. ""If they chose a maximalist campaign, they could pretty much destroy the Ukrainian army as a viable fighting force."" For over a decade, Russia's military has been on a high-speed modernization drive. It routinely shows off new weaponry in military parades, and has tested it in Syria, where Putin's forces stand accused of war crimes. A stronger military has allowed Russia to reassert itself as a world power. Now, experts say, Putin is using that power to threaten Ukraine in a bid to force the country away from the U.S. and NATO, and back under Moscow's control. Near the border separating the two countries, Major Mykola Ferin of the State Border Guard Service told Williams that he and his forces have what they need to defend their territory. The reality, however, according to the U.S., is that a Russian invasion would be horrific, and change the world. Putin was flying to Beijing on Thursday to attend the Winter Olympics opening ceremony on Friday, and to meet China's leader, Xi Jinping. Support from his ally in China could be crucial for Putin if Russia does invade Ukraine, and is then hit with the severe sanctions promised by the U.S. and its allies in response.",4,1.5967878528733066,2.118680863851697,-0.5218930109783906,17
2022-02-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-tensions-putin-united-states-nato-security/,Putin accuses U.S. and NATO allies of ignoring Russia's security needs,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia's top security demands but said Moscow is willing to talk more to ease tensions over Ukraine. The comments were his first on the standoff in more than a month and suggested a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine may not be imminent and that at least one more round of diplomacy is likely. Yet the two sides remain unyielding in their main positions, and there was little apparent hope for concessions. Russia is expected to respond soon to a U.S. proposal for negotiations on lesser Russian demands after which Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will speak. Lavrov and Blinken spoke Tuesday and reiterated positions put forward by Putin and President Joe Biden. The White House said Biden and Putin could also speak once the U.S. receives Russia's response. In remarks to reporters at a Moscow news conference with the visiting leader of NATO ally Hungary, Putin said the Kremlin is still studying the U.S. and NATO's response to the Russian security demands received last week. But he said it was clear that the West has ignored Russian demands that NATO not expand to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations, refrain from deploying offensive weapons near Russia and roll back its deployments to Eastern Europe. Putin argued that it's possible to negotiate an end to the standoff if the interests of all parties, including Russia's security concerns, are taken into account. ""I hope that we will eventually find a solution, although we realize that it's not going to be easy,"" Putin said. Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops along the border of Ukraine, fueling fears of an invasion. It has denied any intention to attack. Washington and its allies have rejected Moscow's key demands. They emphasize that Ukraine, like any other nation, has the right to choose alliances, although it is not a NATO member now and is unlikely to join any time soon. Putin said the Western allies' refusal to meet Russia's demands violates their obligations on the integrity of security for all nations. He warned that a Ukrainian accession to NATO could lead to a situation where Ukraine launches military action to reclaim control over Russian-annexed Crimea or areas controlled by Russia-backed separatists in the country's east. ""Imagine that Ukraine becomes a NATO member and launches those military operations,"" Putin said. ""Should we fight NATO then? Has anyone thought about it?"" Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 following the ouster of the country's Moscow-friendly president and later threw its weight behind rebels in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, triggering a conflict that has killed over 14,000 people. Putin charged that while the U.S. airs concerns about Ukraine's security, it is using the ex-Soviet country as an ""instrument"" in its efforts to contain Russia. He alleged that Washington may try to ""draw us into a military conflict and force its allies in Europe to impose the tough sanctions the U.S. is talking about now."" Another possible option would be to ""draw Ukraine into NATO, deploy offensive weapons there"" and encourage Ukrainian nationalists to use force to reclaim the rebel-held east or Crimea, ""drawing us into a military conflict,"" Putin claimed. Speaking after talks with Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, who has forged closer ties with Moscow than almost any other NATO member, Putin noted that it's still possible to negotiate a settlement that would take every party's concerns into account. ""We need to find a way to ensure interests and security of all parties, including Ukraine, European nations and Russia,"" Putin said, emphasizing that the West needs to treat Russian proposals seriously to make progress. He said French President Emmanuel Macron may soon visit Moscow as part of renewed diplomatic efforts following their call on Monday. In a bid to exert pressure on the West, Lavrov sent letters to the U.S. and other Western counterparts pointing out their past obligations signed by all members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a top trans-Atlantic security grouping. Russia has argued that NATO's expansion eastward has hurt Russia's security, violating the principle of ""indivisibility of security"" endorsed by the OSCE in 1999 and 2010. It says the U.S. and its allies have ignored the principle that the security of one nation should not be strengthened at the expense of others, while insisting on every nation's right to choose alliances. In his letter, which was released by the foreign ministry, Lavrov said ""there must be security for all or there will be no security for anyone."" And in his call with Blinken, Lavrov warned that Moscow will not allow Washington to ""hush up"" the issue. Blinken, meanwhile, emphasized ""the U.S. willingness, bilaterally and together with Allies and partners, to continue a substantive exchange with Russia on mutual security concerns."" However, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Blinken was resolute in ""the U.S. commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of all countries to determine their own foreign policy and alliances."" Blinken ""urged immediate Russian de-escalation and the withdrawal of troops and equipment from Ukraine's borders,"" Price said. He reaffirmed that ""further invasion of Ukraine would be met with swift and severe consequences and urged Russia to pursue a diplomatic path."" Senior State Department officials described the call as professional and ""fairly candid,"" noting that if Russia wanted to prove it isn't going to invade Ukraine, it should withdraw its troops from the border and neighboring Belarus. Shortly after speaking to Lavrov, Blinken convened a conference call with the secretary general of NATO, the EU foreign policy chief and the chairman-in-office of the OSCE as part of efforts to ensure that the allies are engaged in any further contacts with Russia. Speaking to reporters at the United Nations, Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the U.S. statement about its readiness for dialogue ""doesn't correlate"" with Washington sending planeloads of military equipment to Ukraine. ""I don't know why the U.S. is escalating tensions and at the same time accusing Russia,"" he said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Kyiv for scheduled talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Johnson said the U.K. has a package of measures including sanctions ready to go ""the moment the first Russian toecap crosses further into Ukrainian territory."" ""It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy, and I believe that is still possible,"" Johnson said. ""We are keen to engage in dialogue, of course we are. But we have the sanctions ready."" He said he would have a call with Putin on Wednesday, noting that the Russian leader was trying to ""impose a new Yalta, new zones of influence"" in a reference to the 1945 deal between the allied powers. ""And it would not just be Ukraine that was drawn back into the Russian sphere of influence,"" Johnson added. In other developments, Biden was expected to nominate career foreign service officer Bridget Brink to assume the long-vacant diplomatic post of American ambassador to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official familiar with the decision. Brink currently serves as the ambassador to Slovakia.",4,1.3813605830171105,1.5901390315833732,-0.2087784485662627,17

These forces are equipped with wheeled fighting vehicles, and they'll be joining the 900 troops that are already in regular rotation in Romania. About 1,700 of the 2,000 troops coming from the U.S. are coming from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, from the 82nd Airborne Division. Another 300 will be provided by the 18th Airborne Corps. According to a fact sheet released by the Defense Department, these troops can perform a ""variety of missions to deter aggression."" On Wednesday morning, the Pentagon emphasized that the troop movement was temporary and that they would not deploy to Ukraine. ""I want to be very clear about something,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday. ""These are not permanent moves. They are designed to respond to the current security environment. Moreover, these forces are not going to fight in Ukraine. They're going to ensure the robust defense of our NATO allies."" Kirby also noted that these deployments are taking place in addition to movements already made by NATO allies to support Eastern Europeans countries. For instance, six American F-15s and the U.S. Air Force personnel to fly them have arrived at an airbase in Estonia. They're joining Belgian F-16s as part of a multinational force conducting air patrols along the NATO's eastern flank this week. The Pentagon has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could launch an invasion of Ukraine at any time. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley on Friday said Russia has amassed over 100,000 ground forces, air forces, naval forces and special forces, as well as cyber and electronic warfare and other capabilities on Ukraine's border. The troops are moving within Europe to bolster the countries in the eastern flank of NATO. The U.S. already has thousands of troops in Europe that could be called upon to support. For instance, according to the Pentagon, there are approximately 100 rotational U.S. military personnel deployed to Lithuania, 4,000 to Poland, and 60 to Latvia and Estonia. President Biden has said no U.S. troops would deploy to Ukraine if Russia were to invade, but the administration did say it could deploy troops to the region even before an invasion. The U.S. and its partners in NATO have already sent assets to the region in a show of support. Ukraine is not a member of NATO but it shares a border with four NATO countries — Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania — which could face repercussions if Russia were to launch a full invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. has also put 8,500 stateside troops on heightened alert to deploy to Eastern Europe in case NATO activates its shared NATO Response Force, but the alliance has not yet activated it. If both the U.S. troops and the U.S. troops committed to the NATO Response Force deploy, there would be more than 8,500 U.S. troops bolstering the defense of NATO's eastern flank.

The deployment is just part of the Biden administration's efforts to bolster NATO defenses on the far eastern edge of Europe amid soaring tension with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin gave no indication on Tuesday that he was about to bow to pressure from the U.S. and its allies to start pulling back the 100,000-plus forces he has positioned around Ukraine's borders. Instead, he reiterated his accusation that NATO and the U.S. are causing the tension by placing missiles and troops in countries close to Russia's western borders and ignoring his demands for ""security guarantees"" from the alliance. Putin accused the U.S. of using Ukraine as a pawn in a bid to ""contain"" Russia, portraying his own country as the victim even though the current crisis grew out of his still-unexplained decision to deploy tens of thousands of troops around Ukraine's borders. The Kremlin has insisted for months that it's merely for exercises, and that Russian can do what it wants with its own forces on its own soil. But it was only eight years ago that Putin's forces last pushed into Ukraine, to fight alongside separatists who are still locked in battle with Ukrainian troops in the country's east, and to facilitate his annexation of the Crimean Peninsula away from his neighbor. Few countries recognize Putin's 2014 landgrab, but he made it clear again on Tuesday that, as far as his government is concerned, Crimea is now Russian territory. New images released this week by the Maxar satellite company show Putin's military buildup continuing in Crimea, which most nations still consider an occupied part of southern Ukraine, and to Ukraine's north in Belarus, and to its east, on Russian soil. ""During the past couple of weeks, several new significant military deployments have been observed in Belarus,"" Maxar said in an analysis accompanying its latest images. I said the pictures show new housing for forces, ""at virtually every deployment location in Belarus, Crimea and western Russia,"" indicating an ""increased level of activity and readiness."" President Biden has said there's a ""distinct possibility"" that Russia will invade Ukraine again this month, and the White House and its allies have said if that happens, it will be considered not only an aggression against an ally, but an assault on the basic tenets of European security that have kept relative peace on the continent since the end of World War II. The U.S. F-15s now in Estonia — a NATO ally that shares a land border with Russia — joined Belgian F-16s as part of a multinational force conducting air patrols along the alliance's eastern flank this week. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, the sub-freezing temperatures in Estonia are a far cry from North Carolina, where the planes and personnel of the U.S. Air Force's 336th Fighter Squadron are based. Around 120 U.S. personnel have been deployed to the Ämari Air Base, near Estonia's capital of Tallinn and right on Russia's doorstep, along with the fighter jets. D'Agata watched as American F-15 Screaming Eagles soared into the sky from Ämari in a show of U.S. military firepower. The message to NATO allies along the border separating European democracies from Russia is clear: The U.S. has your back. The message to Russia is just as clear: We're watching. The U.S. fighter squadron in Estonia is taking part in what NATO calls an ""enhanced air policing mission."" ""This is a team effort from the NATO alliance,"" Lieutenant Colonel Taylor Gifford, the 336th squadron's Director of Operations, told D'Agata. That cooperation is vital, because the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — all NATO members — are sandwiched between Russia, its ally Belarus and the Baltic Sea. The Russian military has already deployed fighter jets to the region, launched naval exercises in the Baltic and rolled missile systems and troops into Belarus. Moscow says it's just for exercises, but U.S. officials believe Putin could use the presence in Ukraine's northern neighbor, or in Crimea, as potential routes for an invasion. The NATO mission in Estonia was created as a direct response to Russian military aggression. Now, with Moscow threatening once again, it's never been more vital to security in the region. Steps to bolster NATO's presence in the Baltics with additional U.S. forces began after the Russian incursion into eastern Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014. The commander of the Estonian Air Force, Brigadier General Rauno Sirk, told CBS News the U.S. jets that arrived this week are vital, ""to bolster, to strengthen the air policing here and to show that the alliance is taking its business seriously."" Sirk told D'Agata that a Russian fighter jet crossed into NATO airspace near Estonia over the weekend. On Wednesday, the U.K. scrambled fighter jets to intercept Russian aircraft approaching Britain's aviation ""area of interest"" north of Scotland. Eastern European leaders are calling for more U.S. military support in the region, including Estonia's prime minister, who said the only thing Russia respects is ""an American flag.""",4,1.6707381812065245,4.843633856180058,-3.1728956749735335,17
2022-02-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/havana-syndrome-cases-directed-energy/,"Expert panel reaffirms directed energy could be behind ""Havana Syndrome"" cases","Washington — A declassified summary of an expert panel's findings released Wednesday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence found that the mysterious neurological condition known as ""Havana Syndrome"" may be ""plausibly"" explained by pulsed, electromagnetic energy, reaffirming the findings of a previous study but otherwise making little headway in affirmatively identifying a cause. The panel, which included experts from inside and outside the U.S. government, was established by the Biden administration last year with the task of identifying potential mechanisms behind the incidents that for several years have affected scores of U.S. government personnel. Some victims have suffered effects so debilitating they have had to leave the workforce. Intelligence officials familiar with the work of the panel, formally called the Intelligence Community (IC) Experts Panel on Anomalous Health Incidents (AHIs), said Wednesday that a ""subset"" of the incidents could not be explained by known environmental or medical conditions, suggesting they could be due to an external stimulus, including directed energy. ""Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radio frequency range, plausibly explains the core characteristics, although information gaps exist,"" a redacted summary of the findings says. ""Using non-standard antennas and techniques, the signals could be propagated with low loss through the air for tens to hundreds of meters, and with some loss, through most building materials."" The panel noted, however, that ""there is a dearth of systematic research on the effects of the relevant electromagnetic signals on humans."" The officials also said that psychosocial factors, including mass sociogenic illness, could not alone account for the reported symptoms — though they could play a role in compounding or prolonging some victims' medical effects. The panel's main findings are in line with a previous study commissioned by the State Department and published in late 2020 by the National Academies of Sciences, which said the ""most plausible"" cause of the symptoms was ""directed, pulsed, radiofrequency energy."" A small number of members of the expert panel also worked on the National Academies study, officials said. The 2020 study, alongside anecdotal evidence cited by current and former American officials, fueled speculation that the cases could be the result of attempted intelligence collection by foreign government operatives who were using directed energy technologies or weapons, with Russia often mentioned as a leading suspect. No evidence has emerged publicly tying Russia or any other foreign actor or specific technology to the incidents. U.S. officials have warned the Russian government at least twice of consequences, however, if it was determined to have a role. Unlike the interim report issued by the CIA's internal task force last month, the experts panel did not consider questions related to attribution, including whether a foreign actor could be involved. According to the redacted summary, the panel examined thousands of classified documents and interviewed a select number of individuals who had reported symptoms. It focused its efforts on evaluating the plausibility of five potential causal mechanisms: acoustic signals, chemical and biological agents, ionizing radiation, natural and environmental factors, and radio frequency and other electromagnetic energy. It ruled out as ""implausible"" all but pulsed electromagnetic energy and ultrasound used in close proximity to a target. The other mechanisms the panel evaluated ""are unlikely on their own to account for the required effects or are technically or practically infeasible,"" according to the summary. The CIA's report, which did not extensively examine physical or technological explanations for the incidents, ruled out attacks by an adversary in a ""majority"" of cases it examined, while acknowledging they were still possible in a small group of roughly two dozen cases. Those cases are the focus of continued investigation by its task force, intelligence officials said. There have been roughly 1,000 reports of suspected incidents made by U.S. personnel since 2016, when the first spate of cases arose among diplomats and intelligence officers in Havana, Cuba. Incidents have since been reported from every populated continent, and in some cases required officials to be medevaced to the U.S. for treatment. The expert panel personally interviewed between 10 and 20 victims while examining the medical records of ""many, many more,"" officials said. ""We focused on ones that we felt were unique, without other possible explanations,"" one intelligence official said. ""Not to diminish the other cases, but to give us an ability to focus in on a certain number."" The panel's findings were cautiously welcomed by victims' groups, which urged continued investigation into the cause of symptoms that can include nausea, vertigo, ear ringing, debilitating headaches and, in some cases, a diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury. ""Today's release of the unclassified executive summary of the report by the expert panel … reinforces the need for the intelligence community and the broader U.S. government to redouble their efforts to fully understand the causes of Anomalous Health Incidents, or 'Havana Syndrome,'"" one victims' group said. Victims had been more critical of the CIA's interim findings, which they called a ""disturbing curtailment"" of government-wide efforts to arrive at attribution for the incidents and insisted ""must not be the last word on this matter."" Senior officials said the work of the expert panel would continue. ""Moving forward, the work of the IC Experts Panel will help sharpen the work of the IC and broader U.S. Government as we focus on possible causes. We will stay at it, with continued rigor, for however long it takes,"" Director of National intelligence Avril Haines and CIA Director William Burns said in a joint statement. ""The U.S. Government remains committed to providing access to care for those who need it, and we will continue to share as much information as possible with our workforce and the American public as our efforts continue. Nothing is more important than the wellbeing and safety of our colleagues,"" they said. ""We welcome the findings of the Intelligence Community Experts Panel on anomalous health incidents,"" a National Security Council spokesperson said. ""The Panel undertook a rigorous, multi-disciplinary study that has identified important findings and recommendations that will inform intensive research and investigation moving forward as we continue our government-wide effort to get to the bottom of AHI."" The expert panel made seven recommendations for better understanding, preventing and managing the incidents, including streamlining data collection, identifying new biomarkers associated with the illness, improving detection mechanisms and better coordinating communication about the incidents. Importantly, the panel found that in most cases, swift medical care was integral to recovery. ""What we do know is, if you report quickly and promptly get medical care, most people are getting well,"" one official said. Intelligence officials familiar with the panel's work acknowledged that the slow pace of progress in determining a cause was ""frustrating."" ""Part of the challenge is, humans are all different,"" one official said. He cited a panel member who had observed, ""humans are really good sensors, but not the best or sometimes inconsistent reporters."" ""One challenge we're dealing with is the signs, the symptoms, the incidents present themselves in a variety of ways,"" the official said. The officials also noted that some cases could have been exacerbated by the nature of some of the victims' work. ""Other incidents could be due to hyper vigilance and normal human reactions to stress and ambiguity, particularly among a workforce attuned to its surroundings and trained to think about security,"" the summary said. The panel's findings are the latest but presumably not the last of the administration's efforts to arrive at an explanation for the incidents. On Tuesday, President Biden named the senior director for intelligence programs at the National Security Council, Maher Bitar, to officially serve as the government's anomalous health incident interagency coordinator. Bitar had been effectively carrying out this role since early last year, but provisions in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the role be codified. Government agencies with personnel affected by Havana Syndrome — which include the State Department, the CIA and broader intelligence community, the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department, including the FBI — must also now name senior officials to serve as ""AHI Coordination Leads"" and update their guidance on the incidents to their respective workforces by February 25. Victims' groups lauded the appointment, calling it a ""welcome expression of concern and support by the President and his team."" ""We look forward to other agencies and departments designating their AHI leads, as appropriate, and issuing updated guidance to elements of their workforce who are determined to be at risk of exposure to AHI,"" the group's statement said.",20,7.444169458927792,6.121782467602538,1.3223869913252546,18
2022-02-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-news-united-states-un-security-council-putin-response/,"As Russia and the U.S. argue over which side is threatening war in Ukraine, for many Ukrainians, the war is now","Avdiivka, Eastern Ukraine — President Biden says there's a ""distinct possibility"" Russia will invade Ukraine this month. That assertion drew some fiery exchanges at the United Nations Security Council on Monday, as the U.S. pushed Russia to explain to the world why it has massed 100,000 troops around Ukraine's borders. Moscow's envoy said he didn't even know why the meeting had been called, and he accused the U.S. and its European allies of stoking unfounded fears of war. The gulf in the two global powers' positions is so vast they can't even agree on whether the Kremlin provided a written reaction on Monday to the Biden administration's response to Russian demands for ""security guarantees"" from NATO. A State Department spokesperson in Washington said on Monday that Moscow had delivered a response to the U.S., but that ""it would be unproductive to negotiate in public, so we'll leave it up to Russia if they want to discuss their response."" On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said his government had yet to reply to the counter proposals from the White House — which did not include anything close to what Moscow demanded, including Ukrainian NATO membership being ruled out. Lavrov said Russia would respond to the U.S. when it ""sees fit."" But while the two governments argue about who has replied to who and which side is really causing the tension along Ukraine's borders, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports from eastern Ukraine that for thousands of people, it's not a question of when war will start, but if it will ever end. Williams met Ukrainian troops who live in the freezing trenches that carve up farmland and villages across a vast swath of eastern Ukraine, splitting the country in two. The soldiers she met are already fighting Russian-backed separatists: They've been at war on the far eastern edge of Europe since 2014, when Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula. The simmering conflict has left devastation and, by the Ukrainian government's count, claimed more than 14,000 lives in the process. The town of Avdiivka, only around 200 yards from the front line, is battle scarred and broken — a skeleton of its former self with the wreckage of war scattered around its outskirts. Serhii Leyenkyi, who works for the local government, showed Williams and her team a field planted with a deadly crop: The entire area is a giant minefield. Eight years ago, the Russian-backed separatists took control of towns and cities across eastern Ukraine, and as the country spiraled into war, Avdiivka became a flashpoint. Its residents were caught in the crossfire and many people fled, left homeless and hopeless. As the U.S. warns of a possible new Russian invasion, Ukrainians seem remarkably calm — perhaps resigned to the fact that they cannot control their giant neighbor. Some believe Putin wants a Ukraine that answers to him, rather than an ally of the U.S., and that he intends to use force to get his way. That's not a new idea in Avdiivka, where they've been living with the daily punishment of war for years. ""War is every day difficult, you know. When you don't have water, when you don't have electricity, it's very, very bad,"" Leyenkyi told CBS News. Russia insists that it has no plan to invade again, but in Ukraine, Russian aggression isn't a possibility, it is a daily reality.",4,4.52420265323216,1.8125634345407136,2.711639218691446,21

2022-01-31,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-us-ukrainian-civilian-volunteers-train-for-war/,"As Russia sends mixed signals, Ukrainian civilians train for war","Eastern Ukraine — The U.N. Security Council held a meeting on Monday — called by the U.S. and over Russia's objection — to discuss the standoff on Ukraine's borders, along which Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops. The U.S. and its NATO allies have warned for weeks that President Vladimir Putin could use the forces to launch a new invasion of Ukraine as soon as February, though Putin's government denies any such intentions. The U.S. has responded by pouring military hardware in to bolster Ukraine's forces, and NATO has deployed troops, aircraft and warships to reinforce the bloc's defenses in the region. The U.S. and its European allies won't send troops into Ukraine as it's not a NATO member, but they've warned repeatedly that any Russian forces crossing the Ukrainian border will be considered an invasion, and will draw prompt and severe sanctions against Russia. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports, Ukrainians are determined to defend their homeland, but even with an influx of American weaponry, they're massively outgunned and outnumbered by their colossal neighbor. Despite the odds, thousands of Ukrainian civilians have joined local defense units. Williams met some of the citizen soldiers on the outskirts of Ukraine's capital where, every Saturday, they gather and do a quick warm up before they're put through drills — training to help fight off a hypothetical Russian attack. ""I know Russians very well,"" Oleksei Vasilchenko told Williams. The defense unit volunteer works in marketing, but told CBS News he served in the Soviet army before Ukraine gained its independence from Moscow just over 30 years ago. ""If you want peace, you should be prepared for war,"" he said. The defense unit volunteers include everyone from urban professionals to military veterans like Vasilchenko, to new recruits. Many are thus far armed only with plywood rifles — stand-ins for the real thing. Russia's hardware, on the other hand, is impressive — and Moscow has been showing it off. Putin's forces have moved fighter jets, missile systems and about 5,000 troops into Belarus, an ally and neighbor that sits on Ukraine's northern border. Russia insists that it is merely carrying out joint military exercises there, and that there's no plan to invade Ukraine. But on Monday, the Russian military noted that the exercises were expanding with the establishment of ""mobile field command posts"" in Belarus. The lack of Russian command and control centers set up in the border region has been one factor noted by military analysts to suggest that Moscow is not, in fact, planning an imminent invasion. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council members on Monday that the U.S. had ""seen evidence that Russia intends to expand that presence [in Belarus] to more than 30,000 troops near the Belarus-Ukraine border, less than two hours north of Kyiv, by early February."" ""If Russia further invades Ukraine, none of us will be able to say we didn't see it coming,"" Thomas-Greenfield told the meeting, appealing to Russia to pursue a diplomatic path rather than further escalation. Russia fired back during the meeting, accusing the U.S. and its allies of interference for criticizing Russia's military exercises and dismissing the suggestions of a possible invasion as ""conjectures and unfounded accusations."" ""Our Western colleagues talk about the need for de-escalation, but first of all they themselves escalate tension with rhetoric and provoke an escalation,"" Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said. ""Talking about an impending war is provocative in itself."" But the drills in Belarus aside, Russia has done nothing to explain why it decided to move so many forces close to its border with Ukraine over the last year in the first place. Russian officials have said for months that the deployments are merely for exercises, and that they can do what they want when they want on their own soil. In what appeared to be a continuation of the mixed messages coming from Moscow, even as it announced the command posts being set up in Belarus, the Russian military also said on Monday that some 6,000 troops deployed to the west of the country weeks ago, for ""planned operational and combat training,"" had been moved back to their permanent bases. Back in the forest outside Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, the local defense unit's members remained just as uncertain about Putin's intentions as the rest of the world. But they're also determined to be ready. CBS News watched as they kept up their fitness and practiced for the possibility of urban warfare. ""Everywhere here is our land, so we have to defend it,"" said volunteer Oleksei Ilyushan, who's a criminal lawyer during the work week. ""It makes me angry, but it's not like, 'Aargh, What am I gonna do?' — It makes me angry like, to prepare myself, you know?"" The U.S. has said a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be horrific and change the world, but the Biden administration has also said there's still time for President Putin to choose de-escalation. Putin is still formulating his official response to proposals from Washington that were handed over last week as a reply to Russia's demands for ""security guarantees from NATO. Moscow demanded that NATO pull its forces back from Russian border regions and reject any new bids for membership from former Soviet states — most importantly, Ukraine. The U.S. and NATO made it clear that they would not bar any prospective new members on Russia's behalf, but they have indicated a willingness to negotiate on military exercises and weapons deployments in the region, in addition to other ""trust building"" actions that both sides might take to step back from the brink of war. Putin's spokesman said Monday that the Russian leader would give his reply ""as soon as he deems it necessary."" In the meantime, the U.S. and its allies were sure to try to use the public forum of a U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday to increase the pressure on Moscow. The next day, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was to hold a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to the Russian ministry. Britain's foreign and defense ministers were also expected to visit Russia next week, Moscow's ambassador in London told a Russian television station on Monday, as efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis gained urgency.

""For eight years, we are at war and we are defending our country,"" Markarova said in an interview on ""Face the Nation,"" referencing Russia's invasion and occupation of Crimea in 2014. ""At the same time, in order to defend our country, we cannot afford to panic. We have to get ready, all of us, not only our military, our very capable military and veterans, but also all civilians."" While the Biden administration and U.S. allies have warned a Russian invasion of Ukraine is ""imminent"" given the build-up along Ukraine's borders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called the escalation by Russia an act of ""psychological pressure."" A White House official, though, said ""at the same time [Zelenskyy is] downplaying the risk of invasion, he's asking for hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to defend against one."" Markarova rejected that notion, and said Ukraine instead knows ""what Russia is capable of."" ""Let's be very clear here, we know who the aggressor is. Everyone knows who the aggressor is. It's Russia,"" she said. Russia's continued amassment of more than 100,000 forces, as well as tanks and other weaponry, along Ukraine's borders has escalated concerns among the U.S. and allies of a full-scale Russian invasion. In an effort to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from mounting an assault, the Biden administration has pursued a diplomatic route, and has threatened to hit Russia with sanctions if it attacks Ukraine. Ukraine, though, has been pushing for sanctions on Russia now in response to its 2014 invasion of Crimea, as well as in the future should Putin order an attack. ""There are reasons to continue sanctioning Russia for their attack that already happened,"" Markarova said. Ambassador Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, told ""Face the Nation"" that the U.S. has worked with European allies on a ""massive package of economic sanctions"" to ensure that if Putin invades Ukraine, ""he will feel it acutely, as will the Russian people in terms of their economy. It will have a crushing blow on them."" ""Deterrence is best when there's a little bit of strategic ambiguity around exactly what we are going to do,"" she said. ""So we've said financial measures, we've said export controls, we've said new sanctions on Russian elites. But if we put them on the table now, then Russia will be able to start mitigating and that doesn't make any sense to us."" While the U.S. has made clear it prefers to ease the crisis between Russia and Ukraine through diplomacy, Nuland said there has not been signs of de-escalation. Putin has instead moved more forces, she said, though the U.S. does not believe he has made a decision on what to do next. ""As he has done in the past, he's given himself every option, including ... a massive potential invasion of all of Ukraine, including cyberattacks, including incursion from Belarus, where he is moving up to 30,000 troops there as well. So we have to be prepared for all options,"" Nuland said. In response to the ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia, the U.S. is sending $200 million more in military assistance for Ukraine, in addition to the $450 million in defensive aid supplied in 2021. The Pentagon also placed 8,500 troops on high alert for deployment to the region if requested by the NATO alliance, and NATO has sent fighter jets, troops and ships to eastern Europe. President Biden told Zelenskyy during a call Thursday that the U.S. is also ""exploring additional macroeconomic support to help Ukraine's economy amidst pressure resulting from Russia's military build-up,"" according to a readout of the conversation from the White House. Markarova, though, said Ukraine is also looking for assistance from the U.S. with building up its defense capabilities, which she said is ""not only for Ukraine. It's for European security."" ""It's not fighting for Ukraine only, it's actually fighting for values and principles that we all share, that every country has the right to be sovereign, that every country has the right to be free and that all nations have the right to choose how they want to live,"" she said. ""We're fighting for our independence and if Ukraine will be further attacked by Russia, of course they will not stop after Ukraine.""",4,2.0380930110095203,0.6151993051337822,1.422893705875738,26

He also listed the capabilities such as ground maneuver forces, ballistic missiles, air force and said civilians could suffer if war were to break out in the scale and scope possible. ""You can imagine what that might look like in dense urban areas, along roads and so on and so forth. It would be horrific. It would be terrible. And it's not necessary and we think a diplomatic outcome is the way to go here,"" Milley said. Milley drew attention to the terrain of Ukraine, saying that it includes high water tables that when frozen are optimal for vehicle maneuvers. The conventional wisdom is that Russian forces will wait to launch an attack until the ground freezes so tanks can move easily. The Pentagon has put 8,500 U.S. troops in the U.S. on heightened alert for a possible deployment to Eastern Europe. The vast majority would deploy as a part of the NATO Response Force. iIf the alliance activates it to shore up the countries on the eastern flank of NATO. U.S. troops already in Europe could also move to the eastern flank of NATO if needed. Austin said Friday that no troops had moved.",4,0.8939072561369314,1.7242121031775506,-0.8303048470406191,17
2022-01-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stoltenberg-nato-prepared-for-the-worst-russia-ukraine/,"Stoltenberg says NATO is ""prepared for the worst"" in Russia-Ukraine conflict","NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the transatlantic alliance is ""ready to engage in political dialogue"" but ""also prepared for the worst — Russia once again using force against its neighbor, Ukraine."" Stoltenberg made the comments in a Friday interview with CBS News ""Face the Nation"" moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan. The interview with Stoltenberg comes as Russia reviews the United States' response to its demands amid the Russian military buildup near Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Biden spoke on the phone Thursday to address the situation, and Mr. Biden has been consulting with European allies. Mr. Biden said at a press conference last week that it was his ""guess"" that Russia would invate Ukraine. Asked if Russian military force in Ukraine is imminent, Stoltenberg said there's ""no certainty."" ""Well, there's uncertainty about the Russian plans, and maybe they have not made any final decision,"" Stoltenberg said. ""... We are ready to engage in political dialogue, but we're also ready to respond if Russia chooses and armed conflict, confrontation. So we are ready for both options. We are working hard for the best peaceful political solution, but we are also prepared for the worst — Russia once again using force against a neighbor, Ukraine."" Ukraine is not a NATO member, and Russia has sought assurances that Ukraine will never be a NATO member. Stoltenberg described what preparation looks like militarily. ""We have already, after Russia used force against Ukraine in 2014, for the first time in our history deployed combat-ready NATO battle groups in the eastern part of the alliance—in the Baltic countries and in Poland,"" he said. ""We have air-policing both in the Black Sea region and in the Baltic region. We have more naval presence, and over the last weeks we have actually stepped up the number of planes and ships in these different missions."" But Stoltenberg declined to say what the threshold is for deploying a NATO response force. ""We will never give any potential adversary that kind of privilege of defining exactly the threshold,"" Stoltenberg said. ""What we will do is that we will always be sure that we have the necessary forces in the right place at the right time to defend and protect all allies."" Stoltenberg said NATO's core task is to defend its 30 allies, which represent roughly 1 billion people across North America and Europe. But the alliance has now stepped up its presence in its eastern parts for the first time in its history, so ""if Russia wants less NATO at its borders, they've actually achieved exactly the opposite."" In a news conference Friday, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Ukraine has the right to be independent, and strongly encouraged Russia to stand down. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said ""conflict is not inevitable,"" and there is still time for diplomacy. — CBS News' Mary Walsh, Richard Escobedo and Eleanor Watson contributed to this report.",4,0.6488015427679344,1.7118544896546024,-1.063052946886668,17
2022-01-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-us-putin-says-no-war-biden-call-zelenskyy-invasion-talk/,Russia insists it won't start a war as Ukraine seeks to tone down the invasion rhetoric from the U.S.,"Russia's top diplomat insisted on Friday that Moscow isn't going to start a war with Ukraine. But with more than 100,000 Russian troops massed along the country's borders, he also said Moscow would not ""be ignored."" ""If it depends on the Russian Federation, there will be no war,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. ""We do not want wars, but we will not allow our interests to be rudely attacked, we will not allow our interests to be ignored."" Amid warnings from the White House that Russia could again invade Ukraine, as it did in 2014, within weeks, Moscow appeared to be embracing a divide and conquer strategy — seeking to exploit any glint of light between the U.S. and its European allies. The latest salvo in the war of words between Moscow and the West came in the form of a backhanded compliment. Lavrov lauded the White House's written response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands that NATO pull its forces back from Russia's western borders and reject new members in the region. But the praise came at the expense of the NATO alliance itself. ""Against the background of the paper that was sent to us from NATO, the American response looks almost like a model for diplomatic decency,"" Lavrov said, blasting NATO's earlier response to Russia's demands as ""so ideological"" that he was ""a little ashamed of those who wrote these texts."" It was a pointed jab at the U.S.-led trans-Atlantic security alliance, which Putin views as a threat to Russia's power and influence in the region. That power has waned since the fall of the Soviet Union and Putin is determined to prevent more ex-Soviet states, like Ukraine, from being folded under the NATO umbrella. On Friday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he wouldn't risk informing any adversary of the exact ""threshold"" that would draw a unified military response from the alliance, but he said NATO would ""always be sure we have the necessary forces in the right place at the right time to defend and protect all allies, and we've done that for more than 70 years."" Russia's loosely veiled attempt to imply division among its adversaries came on the heels of President Joe Biden's phone call on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That call, despite readouts from both Washington and Kyiv stressing unity, appeared to highlight some level of discomfort in the Ukrainian capital with the urgency Mr. Biden's administration is placing on the threat of a Russian invasion. A source familiar with the call told CBS News that Zelenskyy asked the U.S. to tone down its rhetoric about a possible imminent invasion. The White House rejected as ""completely false"" reports that Mr. Biden had warned Zelenskyy on the phone that his country was ""virtually certain"" to see Russian forces invade imminently, and even ""sack"" the capital city. A National Security Council spokesperson said in a tweet that Mr. Biden had instead told Zelenskyy there was ""a distinct possibility"" of an invasion in February. ""Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false."" The White House has warned for weeks, however, that Russia could launch an invasion as soon as this February. U.S. and Ukrainian intelligence have also warned of the possibility of Russian airstrikes on Ukrainian command and control centers, including those located around Kyiv. The Ukrainians' most immediate concern is that Putin will opt for less overt aggressions — smaller-scale border incursions or ""false-flag"" attacks that Moscow might use to accuse Ukraine's forces of an escalation. Kyiv believes any Russian assault would likely be preceded by cyberattacks targeting the country's infrastructure, to create instability and erode confidence in Zelenskyy's government. Putin has already shown a preference for such tactics. Mr. Biden and his European allies have stressed that any Russian troops crossing onto Ukrainian soil will be considered an invasion and will be met with swift and severe sanctions against Moscow. NATO and the U.S. will not send combat troops in to defend Ukraine, which is just a NATO partner and not a full member. Instead, the forces being deployed or put on alert are meant to reassure nervous NATO members who fear this could spill over into a regional conflict and threaten them. The State Department acknowledged on Thursday that the U.S. is considering deploying unilateral forces to states along NATO's eastern flank since the U.S. can move faster than the NATO, which requires consensus among the allies. Despite the soaring tension, Zelenskyy has consistently urged the Ukrainian people to remain calm. His government knows that panic — people clearing out supermarket shelves or trying to flee the country — would be massively destabilizing. That may be exactly what Russia wants: British intelligence has warned that Putin could try to exploit instability in Ukraine to reinstall a friendly government there. On the streets of Kyiv, everything looked normal on Friday. The prevailing calm may be largely due to the fact that, for Ukrainians, this is nothing new: They've been living with Russian aggression for years. Since Putin's forces last invaded in 2014, annexing the Crimean Peninsula, war has simmered between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. The conflict had already claimed more than 14,000 lives, according to Kyiv, before the tension skyrocketed with Russia's movement over the course of the last year of tens of thousands of forces to the border region. Moscow insists the troops and weapons are only there for exercises, that they pose no threat to Russia's neighbors, and that it can do what it wants with its military on its own territory. The symbolic heart of Ukraine's capital, a large central square in Kyiv known as the Maidan, is a reminder of just how fragile the country is, caught in a tug of war between Russia and the West. Almost eight years ago exactly, CBS News was in the Maidan covering massive protests against the country's previous president, who was pro-Russian. State security forces opened fire on the protesters, and it ended with dead bodies on the square. The pro-Russian factions in Ukrainian politics have not disappeared, they've just been voted out of leadership. Zelenskyy knows Putin could try to exploit any opportunity to put friendly faces back in power in Kyiv. Clearly there are varying assessments in Ukraine, the U.S. and other NATO countries about what Putin really plans to do. Ukraine's government knows there's a threat, however, and its government is trying very hard to avoid falling into a trap and panicking its roughly 45 million inhabitants. The U.S. has said the ball is now in Russia's court. Putin is still formulating his response to the U.S. and NATO's replies to his demands. He spoke on Friday with French President Emmanuel Macron, and French officials said they had agreed on the need to deescalate the situation and to continue talking. The Biden administration believes time is running short to negotiate a diplomatic solution to the crisis. In a bid to increase the pressure on Russia, the U.S. has called for a meeting at the United Nations to make its case, in public view. The U.S. called for an open meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Monday — a day before Russia assumes the rotating presidency of the council and therefore gets to set its agenda — to discuss what U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield called Russia's ""threatening behavior."" Thomas-Greenfield said world powers needed to examine ""what is at stake for Ukraine, for Russia, for Europe, and for the international order should Russia further invade Ukraine."" The open meeting was to take place Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern.

2022-01-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/holly-williams-on-the-takeout/,"CBS News correspondent Holly Williams on ""The Takeout""","As Russian forces threaten the Ukrainian border, life in the capital city of Kyiv is remarkably normal, says CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams, who has covered Ukraine for years and spent last week reporting from the former Soviet nation. ""What's always interesting to me is explaining the kind of places that I go, which include not just Ukraine, but Syria, and Iraq, and Yemen, is how normal life is, even when there's an active war going on,"" Williams told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in this week's episode of ""The Takeout"" podcast. ""It feels very normal, but when you talk to people, they're definitely worried. They're definitely concerned that there's going to be an invasion. People have different threat perceptions. Some people think it's more likely than others, but you don't feel it walking down the street."" Williams said Ukrainians are accustomed to living with the threat of Russian hostilities after the 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in southern Ukraine. ""People here have been living with Russian aggression for so long, and there's that sense that, you know, we've dealt with, and we know how this works,"" Williams said. She added that many Soviet-era bomb shelters she has toured with locals have been updated in recent years. In the course of her reporting, Williams has also met civilians willing to take up arms to defend their homeland. Russia has already engaged in cyberattacks in Ukraine, damaging parts of the country's power grid. Military drills along Ukraine's borders have continued, and recently Russian fighter jets were relocated just across Ukraine's border in Belarus. Williams said that Ukraine's history as a part of the Soviet Union plays a role in Russia's recent aggressions, as does Moscow's antipathy toward a country on its border that aligns itself with NATO. ""Russia says that despite the fact that it's moved hundred thousand troops to the border, that it's the real victim, that it's threatened by U.S. and NATO's aggression and that it needs security guarantees,"" Williams said, adding that pro-Russian propaganda in the region shares the same messaging. ""What is Russia's bottom line here? I think a lot of people think what's really going on here is that Vladimir Putin, the people who work with him, think that Ukraine should come back into Russia's orbit. They don't want a Ukraine that's kind of partnered with the West."" Williams said that Putin's interest in Ukraine could be tied to his desire to revive aspects of the Soviet Union, his disagreements with NATO, and the strategic benefits to having Ukraine under Russian influence with the numerous natural gas pipelines that run through Ukraine. The sense of nostalgia in attempting to recreate Russian global dominance stems directly from Putin's upbringing, Williams said. ""This is the guy who grew up in the Soviet Union. This is a guy who was a KGB agent, and he seems to want to recreate that, recreate some kind of Soviet empire or Russian empire,"" she added. Williams and Garrett also discussed what the U.S. is doing to support Kyiv, which includes additional military supplies but not ground troops. ""The U.S. is giving Ukraine extraordinary amount of military support. The U.S. is saying we'll hit Russia with sanctions, more sanctions if you invade. But the U.S. has also ruled out for now, at least sending combat troops to Ukraine,"" Williams said, adding that this looming threat from Russia is why Ukraine wants to join NATO and its mutual defense pact. ""[Ukraine] wants that threat to be directed at Russia. If you touch us, all of these other countries are going to hit you,"" Williams said, adding a range of outcomes are possible - from full-scale invasion to cyberattacks to Putin keeping troops at the border indefinitely. ""Putin could just keep those troops on the border, right?,"" Williams said. ""Maybe add some more troops, maybe add some more hardware, and kind of keep on ratcheting up the pressure in this seemingly Cold-War style kind of game of brinkmanship,"" Executive producer: Arden Farhi Producers: Jamie Benson, Jacob Rosen, Sara Cook and Eleanor Watson CBSN Production: Eric Soussanin Show email: TakeoutPodcast@cbsnews.comTwitter: @TakeoutPodcastInstagram: @TakeoutPodcastFacebook: Facebook.com/TakeoutPodcast",4,2.1835177013376375,3.051633984562654,-0.8681162832250164,17
2022-01-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-reaction-united-states-nato-ukraine-crisis-war/,Russia's reaction to U.S. and NATO leaves Ukraine crisis to fester on the brink of war,"Kyiv — Russia and NATO are continuing their military buildup around Ukraine, including more Russian fighter jets just across Ukraine's northern border in Belarus. Russia's ongoing military exercises with its Belarusian allies have fueled fears that Russia could launch an invasion into Ukraine, as it did in 2014. The U.S. and its NATO allies presented President Vladimir Putin's government with a written response to his demands for ""security guarantees"" on Wednesday, hoping to keep the crisis on a diplomatic track. But in the meantime, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams says America and its allies continue preparing for a possible Russian invasion. On Thursday, Russia's foreign minister said Putin had personally reviewed the response hand-delivered by the U.S. ambassador in Moscow. The reaction from Moscow indicated disappointment, but also a decision to keep talking, for now. The biggest ""guarantee"" Putin's regime sought is a commitment that NATO will rule out admitting Ukraine or any of its neighbors as new members of the trans-Atlantic security alliance, while also pulling forces back from Russian borders. NATO has bolstered troop and weapons deployments in the region — as a direct response to Russia moving some 100,000 of its forces close to Ukraine's eastern frontier, and now to its north in Belarus. The U.S. and NATO made it clear even before their formal response was delivered to Moscow that any ban on new NATO members in Eastern Europe was a ""non-starter,"" but they indicated a willingness to discuss other issues, including military exercises, weapons deployments in the region and other ""trust-building"" actions that could be taken by both sides. ""There was no positive response to the main question,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a statement on Thursday, referring to Ukraine's bid for NATO membership, but ""there is a response which gives hope for the start of a serious conversation on secondary questions."" But while diplomacy appeared set to continue, including bilateral talks expected in the coming days between Putin and France's leader, both sides in the standoff are keeping the pressure on. Russian military drills continue near Ukraine's borders. On Thursday, Moscow accused the U.S. of planning to position more missiles in the region. A senior foreign ministry official warned that such steps risked sparking a ""new missile crisis."" His warning came weeks after Russia refused to rule out positioning military hardware in Venezuela or Cuba, which brought echoes of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Six U.S. fighter jets arrived in Estonia, meanwhile, to take part in NATO military exercises. Slovakia's foreign minister said on Thursday that NATO was considering deploying additional troops to his country, too. Estonia and Slovakia are both NATO members. Estonia shares its eastern boundary with Russia, while Slovakia sits just west of Ukraine. NATO military deployments like those — in what Russia considers its own backyard — are something the Biden administration has indicated a willingness to negotiate on. ""The placement of offensive missile systems in Ukraine, military exercises and maneuvers in Europe — all of these things would address, I think, mutual concerns, including concerns stated by Russia,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday as the U.S. response to Russia's demands was delivered. While the U.S. and its allies have made a point of stressing their unity in confronting Russia's aggression, some of those allies rely heavily on Russia to meet their energy needs, including Europe's largest economy, Germany. That has tested the alliance's resolve. Germany is the biggest buyer of Russian natural gas, and it has refused to send weapons to Ukraine. But Germany's top diplomat indicated on Thursday that the country was in lockstep with its NATO allies in confronting Russia via sanctions, at least — even if that means looking for other gas suppliers, with some help from Washington. ""We are working on a strong package of sanctions,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told her nation's parliament on Thursday, noting that those sanctions could impact the long-awaited switching-on of the new ""Nord Stream 2"" gas pipeline, which connects Russia's suppliers directly with Western European consumers. The U.S. has long pressured Germany to avoid increasing its dependency on Russian energy with the pipeline, and it seemed assurances from Washington — to help arrange alternate gas supplies if Germany backs sanctions that impact Russian energy sales — may have helped to get Berlin on board. ""Should Russia choose to weaponize its natural gas by cutting supply to Europe even more than it's already done, we're in discussions with governments and major producers around the world about surging their capacity,"" Blinken said on Wednesday, alluding to discussions with U.S. allies in the Mideast who have their own gas fields. But while both sides continue to dig in, literally and figuratively, along the frontier separating Russia and European democracies, the people of Ukraine remain stuck in the middle. At the ornate, golden-domed St. Michael's Monastery in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, where the faithful have worshiped for over 900 years, some Ukrainians told Williams that they're praying for peace. One woman told CBS News that she hopes God himself will talk some sense into Russia. The U.S. said that with the handover of the response to Russia's questions on Wednesday, the ball is back in Moscow's court. With the Kremlin voicing disappointment, but not abandoning diplomacy, the next move is still hard to predict.",4,1.1098941797536257,2.427739424729764,-1.3178452449761384,17
2022-01-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-cyberattack-high-alert-united-states/,"DHS says U.S. on ""heightened alert"" for Russian cyberattack","With more than 100,000 Russian troops poised at the Ukrainian border, the Department of Homeland Security is warning that Russia could conduct a cyberattack against the United States if it feels threatened by further actions the U.S. takes in response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to a DHS Intelligence and Analysis bulletin sent to law enforcement partners nationwide, the U.S. government assesses that Russia would consider a cyberattack if ""a US or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security."" ""Russia maintains a range of offensive cyber tools that it could employ against US networks—from low-level denials of service to destructive attacks targeting critical infrastructure,"" the bulletin issued Sunday and obtained by CBS News, continued. The advisory follows the U.S.' decision to surge lethal weaponry to Ukraine's military in an effort to shore up its defenses. Last week, the Biden administration approved a proposal by NATO members Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia to send Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger air-defense systems to Ukrainian forces, as well as the transfer of light anti-tank weapons from the United Kingdom. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CBS News Thursday, ""it's very difficult to calibrate the likelihood"" of a cyberattack launched by the Russian government or its proxies in response to American support to Ukraine. But the secretary conceded the U.S. is currently on ""heightened alert by reason of the geopolitical landscape."" ""When the specter of harm arises, we call for vigilance. And quite frankly, in the cybersecurity arena, ever-present vigilance is what we call for,"" Mayorkas added. DHS indicated in its assessment that ""Russia's threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive cyber attacks in the Homeland probably remains very high."" Officials ""have not observed Moscow directly employ these types of cyber attacks against US critical infrastructure—notwithstanding cyber espionage and potential prepositioning operations in the past."" In 2021, Russian-linked cyber gangs launched two devastating cyberattacks on the United States. Cybercriminals targeted the computer networks of Colonial Pipeline, America's largest fuel pipeline operator, responsible for delivering 45% of fuel along the East Coast and forced the shutdown, in April. Weeks later, an attack on JBS — the world's largest meat processing company – forced the company to halt cattle-slaughtering operations at 13 of its plants. The U.S. has also blamed the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) for the 2020 SolarWinds breach. The sophisticated spy campaign infiltrated more than 18,000 government and private computer networks and ultimately targeted nine federal agencies and scores of U.S. companies. Last week, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency known as ""CISA"" issued a memo urging leaders and network defenders to be on alert for malicious cyber activity after Ukrainian government servers were hit by an overnight defacement campaign. The digital sabotage forced government websites to be taken down, including the homepage for the Foreign Ministry, which temporarily displayed a message warning Ukraine's people to ""be afraid and expect the worst."" Ukrainian officials pointed the finger at Russia for another cyber outage. In 2016, Russian cybercriminals crashed the Ukrainian power grid with a click, causing nearly a quarter of a million people to lose power in the Ivano-Frankivsk region. In a sign of the U.S.' growing concern, both the DHS intelligence bulletin and the CISA memo followed a joint intelligence advisory from CISA, the FBI and NSA issued earlier this month, informing U.S. organizations of ""Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure."" ""As we push towards a conflict and we escalate, [cyber attacks] are more likely to be used by Russia that allows them to be aggressive, without escalating to a full out war,"" John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at Mandiant Threat Intelligence, briefed reporters, last week. ""Russia is a full spectrum player,"" Hultquist added. ""They send teams out physically, they hijack supply chains, they do information operations, they carry out cyber attack and cyber espionage. Thinking about their operations, they're very comfortable within the limitations of cyber.""",20,5.59646092793574,4.339722953789818,1.2567379741459224,16
2022-01-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-biden-putin-sanctions-ukraine-reaction/,Russia ridicules Biden's remarks about sanctioning Putin if Russia launches an invasion as U.S. pours weapons into Ukraine,"Russia on Wednesday dismissed the latest warning from President Joe Biden, who said the previous day that the U.S. could seek to sanction President Vladimir Putin personally if he sends forces across the border to invade Ukraine. Putin's spokesman said any such sanctions would be ""destructive,"" but not ""painful"" because, according to the Kremlin press secretary, Russia's senior leaders don't hold overseas bank accounts or assets. Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, President Biden said that if Putin were to send the roughly 100,000 troops he's massed along Ukraine's borders into the U.S.-allied country, ""it would be the largest invasion since World War II. It would change the world."" Asked if his administration would sanction Putin personally, Mr. Biden replied: ""Yes… I would see that."" The president's comment was the latest ratcheting up of tension between the U.S. and Russia over what the White House and its NATO allies believe are Putin's possible plans to invade Ukraine, as his forces did in 2014 when they annexed Crimea. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams, reporting on Wednesday from Kyiv, said so far, Putin has appeared unmoved by the warnings from Mr. Biden and other NATO leaders. Even as the U.S. pours in weapons to better arm Ukraine's forces and NATO deploys warships and troops to the region, there's no indication that Russia is backing down. Russia has continued carrying out military exercises along Ukraine's borders on land, and with its naval forces at sea. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov delivered the rebuttal to the latest warning from Washington on Wednesday. He was quoted by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti as attributing the notion of sanctions against Putin or other Russian leaders to ""U.S. congressmen and senators who are not entirely familiar with this topic,"" and who would have been wise to first consult ""those who are professionally engaged in Russia."" He said it had ""long been prohibited for representatives of senior leadership and officials"" to hold foreign assets. ""Therefore, of course, such a formulation of the question is absolutely not painful for any one of the representatives of the top management."" Putin is widely believed to hold significant financial assets, but his personal wealth remains a mystery. Whatever assets he does have are well hidden, and it's unclear how much impact any new American sanctions might really have on the man who has led Russia for more than two decades. The White House, while warning repeatedly for weeks that Russia would face ""severe"" and ""unprecedented"" sanctions if it invades Ukraine, has provided no detail on the further measures it's considering, with allies or unilaterally. Putin's intransigence in the face of the warnings from the West has led to questions about whether a conflict is inevitable, and what his motivation for a hypothetical attack on Ukraine could be. As Williams reports, Ukraine's leaders have taken to the airwaves this week urging their nation to remain calm. ""Don't worry, sleep well,"" the defense minister said Tuesday. But the 79-ton planeload of American military equipment that landed in Kyiv — nearly 300 Javelin anti-tank missiles and other munitions — tells a somewhat different story. It was just the latest shipment of some $200 million worth of emergency military assistance coming from the U.S. Even with the American help, Ukraine is massively outgunned and outnumbered by its giant neighbor to the east, however, and with the Russian troops just over their borders, Ukrainians' fate may be in the hands of just one man: Putin. Russia's soft-spoken strongman leader grew up in the USSR and went on to serve the Soviet Union as a KGB agent. According to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Russian businessman and very public critic of Putin, the president ""wants Russia to become like the Soviet Union again."" ""The most important thing for him is controlling the situation,"" Khodorkovsky told CBS News. The businessman was convicted on corruption charges in Russia that many believe were politically motivated. After serving a decade in prison, he now lives in exile. He said to understand the Russian leader, the U.S. must stop thinking of him as a president. ""You need to talk to him like with [a] criminal boss,"" Khodorkovsky told Williams. He claims that Putin is attempting to recreate the Russian empire as a way of distracting ordinary Russians from their economic hardship, and he says Putin's main goals are simple: Stay in power and enrich himself and his friends. Williams told the Russian dissident it sounded like he was calling Putin the Tony Soprano of global politics. ""Exactly,"" he replied. ""I've said this to Western politicians time and time again… You are dealing with a mafia boss. If you want advice on how to talk to Vladimir Putin, ask your police."" The current standoff on Ukraine's border began, Williams noted, because Russia moved tens of thousands of its troops to that border. But Putin's government insists Russia is the victim — threatened by alleged aggression from the U.S. and NATO. Some analysts believe Putin does not want another democracy on Russia's western flank with close ties to the U.S. and NATO, and is trying to threaten Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit, and force the U.S. and its allies to let him have what he wants.",4,2.8842522429971273,2.1513090571318445,0.7329431858652828,7
2022-01-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-tactics-war-nato/,"If not a full-scale invasion, what might a Russian attack on Ukraine look like? We've seen it before.","Kyiv, Ukraine — The U.S. government's warning that Russia could launch a cyberattack targeting America's critical infrastructure likely surprised very few Ukrainians. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams and her team have been reporting on Russia's aggression in Ukraine — in its many forms — since Vladimir Putin's forces last invaded in 2014. Russia's buildup of about 100,000 troops around Ukraine's eastern borders has fueled fear of a full-scale invasion. Stressing their unity, the U.S. and its European allies have issued increasingly stark warnings that any Russian forces crossing the border would bring ""massive"" and ""severe"" consequences for Putin's government. But Williams' reporting on the war that has simmered quietly for seven years on the fault line between Russia and the democratic West shows Putin's tactics are often obscured. The question for Ukrainians now is not just if Russia will attack, but how. As NATO deployed fighter jets, troops and ships to reinforce defenses in Eastern Europe, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed his people on Monday evening. He urged them not to panic. Russia still insists it has no plans to invade Ukraine. The Kremlin blames the U.S. and NATO for causing the current crisis. Putin's spokesman pointed on Tuesday to the Biden administration putting 8,500 more troops on a state of heightened alert, ready to deploy to Europe if needed, as another ""escalation of tension."" But Russia has invaded Ukraine before, seizing control of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. That experience, and Russia's actions since, have drawn warnings from the U.S. that Moscow could rely on more secretive tactics. ""Paramilitary tactics, so-called gray zone attacks, and actions by soldiers not wearing Russian uniforms,"" said President Biden last week. Russia already stands accused of that in eastern Ukraine. Williams and her team witnessed first-hand Russian-backed separatists taking control of towns and cities in the Donbas region in 2014. That conflict has now killed more than 14,000 people. The U.S. says Russia controls the armed rebels. Seven years ago, CBS News saw well-equipped forces working alongside those rebels with all identifying insignia and national colors missing from their uniforms. ""I'm just a person,"" one of the men told Williams when she asked if he was Ukrainian or Russian. He wouldn't say any more. As recently as November last year a verdict delivered by a Russian court in a bribery case appeared to inadvertently reference the presence of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine's rebel-held Donbas region. Moscow flatly denies the presence of any Russian forces in Ukraine. Asked about the verdict that mentioned such a presence — which was quickly removed from the court's website — Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was ""probably the mistake of those who wrote this text."" Then there's Russia's proclivity for virtual warfare. Suspected Russian hackers have previously succeeded in crashing parts of Ukraine's power grid. When one power station came under attack in 2015, nearly 250,000 people lost electricity. The Department of Homeland Security has warned law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that Russia could target America with cyberattacks if ""a US or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security."" ""Russia maintains a range of offensive cyber tools that it could employ against U.S. networks — from low-level denials of service to destructive attacks targeting critical infrastructure,"" a bulletin issued Sunday by DHS warned. There is still hope that diplomacy can resolve the tension, however. Ukrainian and Russian officials will meet in Paris on Wednesday, along with their French and German counterparts, and Putin was to speak directly on the phone with French leader Emmanuel Macron in the coming days.",4,2.9126601022284113,3.623685978095878,-0.7110258758674668,17

The vast majority of the 8,500 troops who have been put on alert would deploy as a part of the NATO Response Force if activated by NATO. Some, however, could deploy unilaterally to bolster countries on the eastern flank of NATO if the security situation in Eastern Europe deteriorates. The Pentagon has not yet identified which units have been put on alert, but the capabilities include additional brigade combat teams, reconnaissance, logistics, aviation, and transportation. U.S. forces in Europe could also be put on heightened alert to move within Europe if asked. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday that the decision was made by President Biden to put these troops on heightened alert, and was in part the result of advice given by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley. ""As of now, the decision has been made to put these units on higher alert, and higher alert only,"" Kirby said. ""No decisions have been made to deploy any forces from the United States at this time."" Some of these have already been in a heightened readiness to deploy posture, and Austin decided ""to shorten the tether even more,"" according to Kirby. Some of the units were on heightened alert to deploy within ten days if asked and now have been told they should be ready in as little as five days. The decision to put these forces on alert comes as NATO announced Monday it will be sending additional capabilities to the countries in the eastern flank of the alliance, and as embassies in Ukraine, including the American embassy, order some departures from the country. Kirby said Monday that Russia has not shown signs of deescalation and has in fact built up more forces along its border with Ukraine and in Belarus in recent weeks. Russia has amassed 100,000 troops along the border with Ukraine in recent weeks, and Mr. Biden said last week that it was his ""guess"" that Russia plans to invade. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that there would be ""massive consequences"" for Russia if its military forces invade Ukraine.",4,2.85355825906068,3.9808755766873682,-1.1273173176266882,27

Russia has been the source of several attacks previously, though it is often hard to know exactly who is responsible. ""I think the Biden administration is trying to cover their bases,"" said Jacquelyn Schneider of Stanford's Hoover Institution. ""They're not really sure of the extent of the crisis, in cyberspace or beyond."" The tensions in Ukraine suddenly don't feel quite as far away now that Homeland Security is warning that an escalation with Russia could produce cyberattacks here. But is an attack from Russia, necessarily an attack by Russia? ""It is actually really hard to know how much of the cyber activity occurring in Russia is officially condoned by the Putin regime,"" Schneider says. Schneider thinks a Putin-directed attack on U.S. infrastructure is unlikely, but then there's the shadowy world of Russian hackers like the group behind the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. ""So, are we going to see more criminal activity during a Russia-Ukraine crisis,"" she asks. ""If you're thinking about security right now, you're too late,"" said San Jose State University professor Ahmed Banafa ""You have to have been thinking about it since we started the whole thing in 2020 with SolarWind."" Banafa says the cyber-conflict is an ongoing one, with plenty of likely targets beyond things like the power grid. ""When you talk about hard targets, you're talking about tech companies that are well-protected,"" said Banafa. ""You're talking about banks. It shouldn't come as a surprise to the big companies. The big companies understand that they are under attack non-stop."" Attacks can come in so many shapes and forms - and from different actors. The threat is an uncertain one, just like the situation in Ukraine. ""We're really unsure about what the overall intentions of Russia and Putin are,"" said Schneider. ""And that bleeds over into cyberspace.""",20,4.35178400739273,3.796546962109642,0.5552370452830884,24

2022-01-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-border-russia-forces-war-fear/,"Anxiety in Ukraine as NATO, U.S. and Russia bolster forces and accuse each other of pushing toward war","Kyiv, Ukraine — With more than 100,000 Russian troops massed near the Ukrainian border, the U.S. government ordered the families of American staff members to leave the country's capital, Kyiv. The State Department advised all private U.S. citizens to do the same, along with American non-essential embassy personnel. Moscow has denied a British government intelligence report suggesting that President Vladimir Putin wants to install a puppet government in Kyiv. But with his forces now deployed on three sides of Ukraine, American officials say Putin has the capacity to launch an invasion at any point — though they remain uncertain as to whether he's made the decision to do so. The Kremlin has sent mixed signals. Moscow denies any intention to invade Ukraine, as it did in 2014, but has warned repeatedly of unspecified ""military action"" if Putin's demands — most notably for NATO to rule out accepting new members in eastern Europe, including Ukraine — are not met. But while American and British diplomats pack their families up and send them home, many Ukrainians tell CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams that they have nowhere to run. They can only hope for peace, while the threat of a Russian attack hangs over them. Williams traveled from Kyiv to a crossing point on Ukraine's northern border with Russia. Just across the frontier, Russia has massed tens of thousands of its forces — on its own soil. Just to the west, Russian fighter jets, troops and missile systems have been moved into Belarus — a Russian ally that also shares a border with Ukraine — for what Moscow says are military exercises. Three decades after the Cold War inspired hope for a safer, more stable world, a U.S. ally in Europe is living in fear of a Russian invasion. Nina Belaya lives in one of the villages nearest to the border — potentially in the firing line if there is any Russian incursion. She showed Williams her cellar, where she stores food for the winter and where, more recently, she's planned to hole up for shelter if Russia attacks. Many Ukrainians now believe their freedom and their country's young democracy are being threatened by their colossal neighbor, and what some believe is Vladimir Putin's ambition to create a new Russian empire. Russia insists there are no plans to launch an invasion, and Putin's government blames the soaring tension on the U.S. and its allies, for arming Ukraine and refusing to reduce the Western military presence in the region. But the fact is that Ukraine is already fighting Russian-backed separatists, and it has been since Putin invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. The U.S. has stepped up its support of Ukraine's forces with both training and weapons. The latest support, $200 million in emergency military assistance from the U.S., has already started arriving. On Monday, NATO said member states had put forces on standby and deployed at least one warship and fighter jets to Eastern European nations as part of efforts ""reinforcing the eastern part of the alliance."" ""NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all Allies,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. ""We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment,"" he said, noting Denmark's recent deployment of a warship and some planes to the Baltic states, Spain boosting its naval presence in the Mediterranean and the Netherlands putting one ship and some land-based military units on standby. A Pentagon official told CBS News' David Martin over the weekend, meanwhile, that President Biden had been presented with options to send ""several thousand"" American troops to Eastern Europe to bolster NATO allies in the face of the Russian buildup. Russia reacted to the NATO movements, and the possibility of more U.S. troops arriving in what it considers its backyard, by claiming it all as further evidence that it is the West stoking tension, not Moscow. Russian lawmaker Andrei Kartapolov, who heads the defense committee in Russia's parliament, said Moscow would ""respond appropriately"" if the United States sent more forces to Eastern Europe or the Baltic countries, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. The attempt to frame the crisis as the West's fault is all straight out of Russia's playbook, according to former U.S. National Security Advisor, General HR McMaster. ""What they do is they twist reality,"" he told CBS News. ""They're always denying what is quite obvious in terms of the form of aggression that they're undertaking."" McMaster said President Putin only understands one thing: deterrence, and if the U.S. should have learned one thing by now about how to negotiate with his government, it's that the Russian leader will always push his luck. ""It's power. I think Putin understands this,"" said McMaster. ""Putin will take whatever he can get.""

The exercise, called Neptune Strike '22, has been in the works since 2020 and is not designed to test any potential scenarios related to Ukraine, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Friday. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that ""this exercise will help demonstrate the unity, capability, and strength of the transatlantic alliance."" The Russian Ministry of Defense announced last week in a press release its own exercises across all areas of responsibility, including in the Mediterranean Sea. The exercises are scheduled to take place in January and February and are planned to involve more than 140 ships and supporting vessels, 60 aircraft, and about 10,000 military personnel. The USS Harry Truman carrier strike group is under the command and control of NATO in the exercise which is scheduled to go until February 4. NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said this is the first time a U.S. aircraft carrier has come under NATO's command since the Cold War. The exercise comes as the American and European officials continue to express concern of Russia's military buildup near the borders of Ukraine that is showing no signs of deescalating. NATO announced on Monday it will send additional ships and fighter jets to NATO to allies in eastern Europe as a deterrent, with the potential to send more if Russia invades Ukraine. ""We have a U.S. aircraft carrier group under NATO command - that is not in the Baltic Sea - but of course it matters for the security of Europe, so we have stepped up,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday, as he listed other steps the alliance has taken recently. ""But this is defensive. NATO is not threatening Russia. It is proportionate,"" Stoltenberg said. Kirby said Friday there were considerations over potentially calling off the exercise given tensions with Russia but ultimately, NATO decided to go ahead with the long-planned exercise.

If NATO asks for help, 8,500 U.S. troops are on ""heightened alert"" to deploy. Russia has built up troops along Ukraine's border of Ukraine in the recent past, but Stefan Iwaskewycz, a Ukrainian-American in Minneapolis, says this time feels different. ""What's happening now that is alarming ... is that it seems like Russia's also putting into place other ancillary necessities if you were actually going to invade,"" Iwaskewycz said.

The question of whether Russia will invade is an urgent one at the Ukrainian American Community Center in northeast Minneapolis, where Iwaskewycz spends time.

The proposed plans come as Russia continues to build up forces near Ukraine's border, with no sign of de-escalation. Mr. Biden in December ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine if Russia invades, but his administration has been open to reenforcing NATO allies on the eastern flank. Those troops could come from U.S. forces already stationed in Europe or from the United States. As of Sunday night, no units had been given orders to move. The administration is considering sending the troops prior to a possible Russian invasion, if NATO allies request them. The number of troops sent to the eastern flank could increase tenfold if Russia launches a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to the official. Moscow said it would ""respond appropriately"" if the U.S. deploys more forces, according to the Reuters news service, citing the Interfax news agency, which was quoting Russian lawmaker Andrei Kartapolov. He heads the Russian parliament's defense committee. Pentagon officials presented the options while Mr. Biden was at Camp David over the weekend. Mr. Biden was joined in person by national security adviser Jake Sullivan and counselor Steve Ricchetti while other officials participated via secure video conferencing. The State Department on Sunday night reissued it's highest travel advisory urging citizens not to travel to Ukraine because of the potential of Russian military action.

Russian military action anywhere in Ukraine would severely impact the embassy's ability to provide consular services, including assistance to U.S. citizens in departing Ukraine, a State Department official told reporters on Sunday night. The State Department is urging those who can depart to do so on commercially-available flights. The decisions were made out of an abundance of caution due to Russia's continued military buildup and disinformation campaigns, a separate senior State Department official said. The State Department does not have a ""solid number"" of how many Americans are in Ukraine, according to the official, because no one is required to register with the embassy while there. Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border, and although the U.S. does not know if Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a decision to invade or if a decision is imminent, he has built the military capacity to invade at any point, one of the officials said. The concern has grown because of Russian forces entering Belarus, just north of Ukraine, to conduct joint military exercises, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. ""If Russia chooses to engage in further military aggression, it has the opportunity to launch the attack from different directions based on where it can launch these incursions against Ukraine,"" one official said. The State Department's travel advisory to Ukraine was already at a level four, the highest level, because of COVID-19, but the advisory was updated to urge citizens not to travel to the country over concerns of the potential of a significant Russian military action against Ukraine. If an incursion were to occur, the security conditions along occupied Crimea and eastern Ukraine are unpredictable and could deteriorate at any moment, according to the official. Though Crimea and the eastern parts of Ukraine are of particular concern, Russian military action anywhere in Ukraine would severely impact the embassy's ability to provide services. The U.S. last month authorized an additional $200 million in defensive aid, and the first shipment which contains lethal aid for the Ukraine defensive forces arrived in Kyiv on Saturday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that there will be ""massive consequences"" for Russia if its military forces invade Ukraine. ""Russia will make its decisions based on President [Vladimir] Putin's calculus of what's in their interest,"" Blinken said. ""We are working very hard to affect that calculus, both in terms of offering a diplomatic path forward that could enhance collective security for all of us and equally a path of defense and deterrence, that makes very clear that if there's aggression, there'll be massive consequences. So the choice is his."" President Biden last week said it was his ""guess"" that Russia would invade Ukraine, and the White House sought to walk back comments he made at a press conference Wednesday that suggested there could be divisions among Western nations about the consequences Russia could face if it launched a ""minor incursion"" into Ukrainian territory. Russia's government has consistently denied any plans to attack Ukraine, but it also leaves the option of unspecified ""military action"" on the table if the U.S. and the West refuse to grant what Putin has called ""security guarantees"" constraining NATO's actions in the region. On Monday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said staffing at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv was ""a question for the American side,"" but she suggested it was more to do with ""how they are building their information agenda"" than actual security concerns. Britain, which has remained in close sync with U.S. rhetoric on Ukraine, said Monday that it, too, was pulling some members of its embassy staff and their dependants out of Kyiv due to ""a growing threat from Russia,"" but that the British Embassy would remain open ""and will continue to carry out essential work."" Other European nations have been hesitant to back the level of sanctions that the U.S. has proposed as a response to any Russian military action against Ukraine, however, and on Monday, top European Union diplomat Josep Borrell said the bloc was ""not going to do the same thing"" as the U.S. and the U.K. with its embassy staff, ""because we don't know any specific reasons."" ""I don't think we had to dramatize as far as the negotiations are going on,"" Borrell said, referring to talks with Russia, ""and they are going on."" Even Ukraine appeared uncomfortable with the latest U.S. move. ""We consider such a step by the American side premature and a display of excessive caution,"" Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said in a statement. He said there had been ""no radical changes"" in the security situation along his country's borders. Nikolenko said that amid ""active efforts"" by Russia to destabilize his country, through ""disinformation, manipulation,"" to ""sow panic among Ukrainians and foreigners... it is important to soberly access the risks and keep calm.""

2022-01-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-putin-ukraine-intentions/,What are Putin's intentions for Russia in Ukraine?,"""This is a big crisis; it's certainly the biggest crisis since the end of the Cold War."" Former NATO Ambassador Ivo Daalder is talking about the buildup of 100,000 Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, a former republic of the now-defunct Soviet Union, teetering between Russia and Europe. ""For the first time in a very, very long time, you see major, major amounts of military equipment in the middle of Europe ready to invade another country,"" Daalder said. It's happening in plain sight of satellites and social media, punctuated by Russian video of live fire exercises. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, said, ""The thing about Russian Federation armed forces that has always impressed me is how they're able to move real far, real fast."" CBS News national security correspondent David Martin asked, ""When you look at that force, what is it capable of doing?"" ""The Russian way of war has always included lots of artillery, lots of long-range rockets,"" Hodges said. ""And so, I think if there's a new offensive, we're going to see an awful lot of serious lethal artillery and rocket fire."" ""Ukraine is a big country; does Russia have forces positioned that could invade all of Ukraine?"" asked Martin. ""I don't think they could successfully roll over all of Ukraine,"" Hodges replied. ""But I don't think that they really want to, or need to, to accomplish what their objective would be."" Russian President Vladimir Putin's objective is to keep Ukraine – the second-largest country on the continent – from making common cause with the democracies of Europe. ""What motivates Putin,"" said Daalder, ""is a concern about the independence of Ukraine, a worry that a functioning, successful, prosperous democracy in Ukraine poses a direct threat to his rule, because it will give people in Russia the idea that they, too, could enjoy what Ukraine enjoys, and rise up against his autocratic rule."" The Ukrainians rose up in 2014 and chased the country's pro-Russian leader into exile. Putin reacted with his first invasion of Ukraine – sending special operations commandos to seize the Crimean peninsula – taking a province of Ukraine and making it a province of Russia. Since then, Putin has been fueling a nasty civil war in eastern Ukraine by backing pro-Russian fighters who want to break off another chunk of the country. Hodges said, ""There have been thousands of people killed there over the past seven years. But as long as [Putin] can manipulate what Ukraine is able to do, then it achieves his strategic purpose."" Russia has already marshalled enough firepower to attack Ukraine with little or no warning, although conventional military wisdom says Putin will wait until February, when the ground is frozen and tanks get better traction. But Putin is scheduled to be in China meeting with President Xi Jinping on February 4 – the same day as opening ceremonies for the Beijing Winter Olympics. Hodges said, ""Is President Putin really going to do something that upstages his friend's big show in Beijing?"" Russian forces are already rolling into the friendly country of Belarus, giving Putin's troops another avenue of advance into Ukraine. Along with his Black Sea fleet, Putin could choose from several different angles of attack. Hodges said, ""We're not going to see 100,000 Russian troops crossing into Ukraine all at one time. I don't expect that. I think most of them actually would probably remain on the periphery in places to continue the threat, to continue the pressure."" Martin asked, ""If Putin takes just part of eastern Ukraine, what does he gain?"" ""He will have demonstrated that the West cannot stop him,"" Hodges replied. ""That would be number one, that he can kind of come and go wherever he wants."" ""If Russia invades, how would it begin?"" ""A series of cyberstrikes designed to neutralize the decision-making authority, so that the president and the head of the general staff can't understand exactly what's happening. That's gonna be the opening gambit,"" said Hodges. Cyberattacks have already defaced dozens of the Ukraine government's public websites, but that's just mischief compared to the damage that could be done to banking, transportation, and electrical systems. Hodges said, ""We're not dealing with Boy Scouts here. These guys are absolutely ruthless at using cyber to wreck all the structures of a society. They absolutely do not care about the damage that it causes, as long as it supports their effort. And part of our problem is that we continue to be surprised because we just can't believe in the year 2022 that a European leader would actually do this sort of thing.""

Ukrainian government servers were hit with a massive cyberattack earlier this month that brought several government websites down. Blinken was in Geneva, Switzerland, on Friday for a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, with the hopes of deescalating the crisis, although there was no breakthrough. The secretary of state, though, said he and Lavrov ""agreed that it's important for the diplomatic process to continue."" The Biden administration has continued to warn that an invasion into Ukraine would bring economic sanctions against Moscow, though President Biden last week told reporters his ""guess"" is that Russia will ""move in."" Russia, meanwhile, has pushed for commitments from NATO, including a withdrawal of NATO troops from Bulgaria and Romania, and for the alliance to vow not to admit Ukraine as a new member. But the U.S. and its allies have said the last demand is a nonstarter, as NATO's membership is not for Russia to decide. Even as Russia has continued to escalate tensions with Ukraine, Blinken said the U.S. has been building up defense and deterrence in anticipation of Putin taking military action. ""We have rallied allies and partners across Europe in a very intense way over the last weeks to make very clear that there would be massive consequences for renewed Russian aggression. We provided more military assistance to Ukraine last year than in any previous year. We've been going after agents of Russia in Ukraine seeking to destabilize the government,"" he said. ""I just approved the transfer of U.S.-origin military technology in other countries to Ukraine. So we are proceeding on both paths at the same time, we'll be ready either way. The choice is Vladimir Putin's."" While the threat of sanctions remains on the table for the U.S., Ukraine is urging the Biden administration to slap Moscow with them now. Blinken, though, said doing so would cause the U.S. to lose leverage. ""The most important thing we can do is to use them as a deterrent, as a means of dissuading Russia from engaging in further aggression,"" he said. ""Once sanctions are triggered, you lose the deterrent effect. So what we're doing is putting together a whole series of actions that would figure into President Putin's calculus.""",4,1.7652799350823034,0.9983189829934003,0.7669609520889031,26
2022-01-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/baltic-nations-missiles-ukraine-us-support-russia-crisis/,Baltic nations to send missiles to Ukraine with U.S. support,"The Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will send U.S.-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine in a move that Washington says it is fully endorsing amid Kyiv's escalating tensions with Russia. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a tweet Saturday that Washington saluted the three NATO nations and former Soviet republics ""for their longstanding support to Ukraine"". ""I expedited and authorized and we fully endorse transfers of defensive equipment NATO Allies Estonia Latvia Lithuania are providing to Ukraine to strengthen its ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked and irresponsible aggression,"" Blinken said in another tweet. Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, earlier this week described western arms supplies to Ukraine as extremely dangerous and said they ""do nothing to reduce tensions."" Moscow has massed tens of thousands of troops at the border with Ukraine, leading to fears of an invasion. The West has rejected Moscow's main demands — promises from NATO that Ukraine will never be added as a member, that no alliance weapons will be deployed near Russian borders, and that it will pull back its forces from Central and Eastern Europe. A meeting Friday between Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ended with no breakthrough. In a joint statement published late Friday, the defense ministers of the three Baltic states said they ""stand united in our commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in face of continued Russian aggression."" They said Estonia would provide Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank weapons while Latvia and Lithuania were sending Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and other related equipment to bolster Kyiv's defensive military capabilities. ""Today Ukraine is at the forefront of separating Europe from the military conflict with Russia. Let´s face it — the war in Ukraine is ongoing and it is important to support Ukraine in every way we can so that they can resist the aggressor,"" Minister of Defense of Estonia Kalle Laanet said. It wasn't immediately clear when the weapons and equipment would be sent to Ukraine. In a separate development, Estonia is seeking Germany's approval to send Soviet-made howitzers, which once belonged to East Germany, to Ukraine. Estonia acquired the howitzers from non-NATO member Finland, which in turn had bought them from Germany's military surplus supply in the 1990s. The German government said Friday it was considering Estonia's request to pass the howitzers on to Ukraine but gave no timeline for a decision. Berlin said it planned to coordinate the issue with Finland, which has received a similar approval request from Estonia. Some recent media reports suggested German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Cabinet has blocked Estonia's transfer of weapons to Kyiv, pointing to strains in the West's response to the Ukraine crisis.",4,2.4062274626120583,2.1653196953193756,0.2409077672926827,17

Mr. Biden said Wednesday that it was his ""guess"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin will ""move in"" to Ukraine. ""If he violates these international norms, if he upsets the regime that's existed in Europe for decades now of respecting international borders … the consequences for Russia will be severe,"" Klain told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell on Thursday. ""We can make President Putin, make the regime in Russia, pay a price for this action if that's what he does."" When pressed if that meant sanctioning Putin personally, Klain said, ""nothing on the economic side is off the table."" Klain said the decision on whether to personally sanction Putin would be made ""at the appropriate time"" by the president and national security officials. The U.S. has repeatedly warned Russia not to invade Ukraine, but Russia has continued to build up its forces along the border. Russia has also moved military hardware and troops into Belarus, which borders Ukraine, for military exercises scheduled for February. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said Wednesday that Russia could attack on ""very short notice."" U.S. officials have confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Biden has permitted several NATO allies to deliver emergency shipments of U.S.-made weapons — including anti-tank missiles — to Ukraine in preparation for an attack. Klain said the U.S. would also respond to other aggressive acts, including cyberattacks, against Ukraine. ""Obviously, those are different than a military invasion. The consequences will be different, but they will be met with appropriate and harsh consequences,"" he said. Klain also spoke with O'Donnell about the president's Build Back Better plan, saying that the administration believes it can pass the plan in smaller pieces after it failed to get enough support in the Senate. ""We think we can get these key elements passed by the Senate. They've passed the House,"" he said. ""We need to get 'em through the Senate. Obviously, it's not done till it's done.""",4,1.520921147711326,1.287094034755354,0.23382711295597192,26
2022-01-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-urkaine-war-united-states-blinken-lavrov-talks-today-latest-news/,Top U.S. and Russian diplomats agree to keep talking to deescalate Ukraine crisis,"Kyiv, Ukraine — America's top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, met Friday with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, on neutral ground in Geneva to try to ease the tension along the Russian-Ukrainian border. Both men played down expectations of any breakthroughs ahead of the talks, and they both emerged saying that, at the very least, the talking would continue. Blinken told reporters that he and Lavorov, ""agreed that it's important for the diplomatic process to continue."" He said it was ""really up to Russia to decide which path it will pursue."" ""I believe we are on a clearer path to understanding each others' concerns,"" Blinken said. America and its European allies were prepared to look for ways to address Russia's own concerns over NATO's presence near its borders, but only ""in the spirit of reciprocity."" ""I laid out several ideas to reduce tensions and increase security,"" Blinken said, noting that the ideas had been formulated with American allies in Europe, and that there could be no resolution to the standoff that failed to secure Ukraine's safety and self-determination as a sovereign nation. ""If any Russian forces move across Ukraine's border, that's an invasion,"" Blinken said. ""It would bring a swift, severe, and a united response from the United States and our partners and allies."" There are roughly 100,000 Russian troops massed along Ukraine's border, and President Joe Biden said this week that his ""guess"" is that Russia will ""move in"" to Ukraine. Mr. Biden has warned that an invasion would be met with tough new economic sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime and lead to a ""consequential"" loss of Russian life. But amid a lack of clear consensus among the U.S. and its NATO allies over exactly how to deter Russia, or how to respond to any hypothetical incursion into Ukraine, the U.S. has continued pushing for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. The Biden administration was hoping to gauge, through Blinken's meeting with Lavrov, what Putin's intentions really are, and whether there are concessions that both sides could agree on to pull back from the brink of war, as NATO and Russia continue moving weapons and forces to the border region. Ukraine's capital of Kyiv is almost 5,000 miles from American soil, but the Biden administration has said the conflict — which has simmered in eastern Ukraine since Putin's forces invaded in 2014 and is now threatening to escalate dramatically — is no simple regional dispute far from American shores. It's about protecting democracy, and stopping Russia from turning its neighbors into puppet states, Blinken said this week. Moscow has consistently denied any intention to invade Ukraine, but has said that if NATO refuses to meet Putin's demands for ""security guarantees,"" it could reply with unspecified military action. New satellite images show the massive buildup of Russian troops and weaponry along Ukraine's borders. Mr. Biden has said a Russian incursion might not use conventional tactics, suggesting Putin could instead rely on ""paramilitary tactics, so-called grey zone attacks, and actions by soldiers not wearing Russian uniforms."" The U.S. has also voiced concern that Russia could use a so-called ""false-flag"" operation as a pretext to attack Ukraine. To step back, Russia has demanded commitments from NATO, including a total withdrawal of NATO troops from Bulgaria and Romania, and for the Western military alliance to promise it will not admit Ukraine — or any other former Soviet State — as a new member. The U.S. and its partners have called that last demand a non-starter, insisting that NATO membership is for the alliance to decide, not Moscow. Blinken and Lavrov spoke separately after their talks in Geneva. Lavrov came to a podium first, saying he expected the United States to provide a clear, written response to all of its demands next week. He was dismissive of the U.S. and NATO's claims that Russia was poised to attack Ukraine, again insisting there were no such plans. ""Today I did not hear a single argument that would substantiate the American position on what is happening on the Russian-Ukrainian border, only concerns, concerns, concerns,"" he said. ""Our concerns are about real facts that no one hides: pumping weapons into Ukraine, sending hundreds of Western military instructors to Ukraine."" The U.S. is sending up to $200 million worth of emergency military aid to Ukraine and has authorized its European allies to transfer American-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to the country. But the U.S. has ruled out sending troop in to bolster Ukraine's forces. Many believe Putin's real motive is to gain control over as much territory in neighboring nations as possible, by any means necessary. ""He works like a terrorist — with nuclear weapons… but he's still a terrorist,"" Ukrainian political analyst Mykola Davydiuk told CBS News. It's been 30 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, but now a European capital is again staring down the barrel of a Russian gun, and Ukrainians are frightened. ""It's not only threaten for Ukraine, it's threaten for all the world,"" Kyiv resident Natalia told Williams on Friday. ""We want a normal life, how we want it, not anybody telling us what to do,"" said another local, Viktor. Before heading into their closed-door meeting, both Blinken and Lavrov played down expectations. ""We don't expect to resolve our differences here today,"" Blinken told reporters before the 90 minute talks. ""But I do hope and expect that we can test whether the path of diplomacy or dialogue remains open."" ""This is a critical moment,"" he added. Lavrov said he didn't ""expect a breakthrough at these negotiations either. What we expect is concrete answers to our concrete proposals."" It was clear that Blinken did not give Russia direct answers to its security demands on Friday. The chances of Moscow getting the answers it wants to demands it has framed as ultimatums still looked slim after the senior diplomats' discussion in Geneva. But they did appear to have bought some more time. The big questions remain, however: How much common ground can the U.S. and Russia find to keep the diplomacy going and a wider armed conflict at bay, and how will Putin respond, as soon as next week, to not getting everything he's demanded from the West? Lavrov said he and Blinken expected to speak again soon, after the U.S. provides formal responses to Moscow's demands.

2022-01-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-nato-ukraine-weapons-defense-russia/,U.S. and NATO to surge lethal weaponry to Ukraine to help shore up defenses against Russia,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken will make another effort Friday to convince Russia to back away from its aggressive positioning around Ukraine, but the low expectations for success are reflected in the U.S.' decision this week to surge lethal weaponry to Ukraine's military in an effort to quickly shore up its defenses. The Biden administration told Congress late Wednesday that it gave approval for four fellow NATO members that had purchased U.S.-produced weapons systems to instead send that equipment to Ukraine, as it tries to defend itself from a potential invasion by neighboring Russia. Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia have been given the green light to send Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger air-defense systems to Ukraine's forces, and the U.S. has also approved the transfer of light anti-tank weapons from the United Kingdom. Some of these systems could also ease air transport of troops. Under U.S. law, permitting allies to send U.S.-origin equipment requires State Department permission due to export controls. In what a State Department official called the ""fastest transfer ever"" for the U.S. government, the Biden administration will also hand over to the Ukrainian government five Mi-17 transport helicopters. These five helicopters were already positioned in Ukraine for servicing. The Russian-made helicopters had been purchased by the U.S. for Afghan forces but since the Afghan military no longer exists, the U.S. can just essentially hand over the keys. Congress was informed that this transfer will be carried out under the Excess Defense Articles program. During his visit to Berlin today in an effort to use diplomacy to de-escalate the growing tensions at Ukraine's borders, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was asked about the Biden administration's decision to help surge weaponry there and stipulated that the military hardware had defensive purposes to protect against aggression that Russia had initiated. ""And so the idea that the provision by the United States, by European countries, by NATO of defensive military equipment to Ukraine is somehow provocative or cause for Russia's actions has the world upside down,"" Blinken said. ""All that we are trying to do is to make sure to the best of our ability that, as I said, Ukraine has the means to defend itself, and that might perhaps deter further aggression by Russia,"" On Friday, Blinken will meet with Russia's top diplomat Sergey Lavrov in Geneva to see if there is any diplomatic off-ramp that can be found to avoid conflict. The Biden administration has made it clear that Russia is considering a variety of ways to attack Ukraine that span from sending tanks across the land borders once the ground freezes to cyber attacks to scaler scale acts of sabotage or provocations by non-uniformed operatives. A Ukrainian official and a senior Democratic aide each told CBS News that there is concern about the ability of Ukraine's air defense to withstand a Russian air assault. The Ukrainians want an ""Iron Dome""-type system similar to what the U.S. provides to Israel, but such a defense could take some time to produce and deploy. In recent days, U.S. officials have warned that the estimated 100,000 Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine could launch an attack at any point. Ukraine estimates it now has roughly 127,000 Russian troops encircling it. The arrival of Russian troops in Belarus this week for war games now means that Vladimir Putin is positioned to potentially launch an attack from the north in addition to the eastern flank where his troops have been positioned since November. Russian forces also are to the south in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. Blinken said Wednesday that the U.S. knows there are plans in place to increase those forces even more on very short notice. ""And that gives President Putin the capacity also on very short notice to take further aggressive action against Ukraine,"" Blinken said following his visit in Kyiv with Ukraine's President Zelensky. Over the course of 2021, the U.S. supplied Ukraine with $450 million in defensive aid, according to a U.S. defense official. The State Department recently approved $200 million more in military aid, which is expected to start shipping to Ukraine this month. The aid from the U.S. has included both lethal and non-lethal weapons, from Javelin anti-tank missiles, to patrol boats, to small arms and ammunition. The Javelin anti-tank missiles, first given to Ukraine in 2018, use thermal imaging and can hit tanks from above, where the armor is the thinnest. The decision by the Trump administration to authorize the sale of Javelins marked the first time the U.S. government directly sold lethal weaponry to Ukraine, though private commercial sales had been approved on a case-by-case basis since 2015, according to the Atlantic Council. Blinken said Wednesday that the U.S. would provide additional material not yet in the pipeline if Russia carries through with any aggressive intent or further invades Ukraine.",49,2.0170162892317753,4.064400465251097,-2.047384176019322,27
2022-01-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sanctions-ukranian-russia-destabilization/,U.S. sanctions four Ukrainians it alleges were working with Russia to destabilize Ukraine,"The U.S. government on Thursday issued sanctions on four Ukrainians who it said were engaged in Russia-backed ""influence activities to destabilize Ukraine,"" as Western powers continued signaling to Moscow that any further aggression against Ukraine would result in punitive economic and political consequences. ""Russia has directed its intelligence services to recruit current and former Ukrainian government officials to prepare to take over the government of Ukraine and to control Ukraine's critical infrastructure with an occupying Russian force,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement announcing the sanctions. Two of the four individuals are current members of the Ukrainian parliament, and are accused of working at the direction of Russian intelligence services to ""create instability in advance of a Russian invasion,"" including by undermining pro-Western politicians and ""laying the groundwork for a new, Russian-controlled government in Ukraine."" In a statement, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kremlin officials in 2020 ""launched a comprehensive information operation plan designed in part to degrade the ability of the Ukrainian state to independently function; the individuals designated today played key roles in that campaign."" The slate of sanctions was ""separate and distinct,"" the Treasury Department said, from the broader range of sanctions the U.S. and European nations have vowed to slap on Russia if it attacked Ukraine. Blinken, who is scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Friday, downplayed the likelihood of a diplomatic breakthrough in public remarks in Berlin. He had traveled to the German capital following a trip to Kyiv, Ukraine to meet with German, French and British counterparts. ""These are difficult issues we are facing, and resolving them won't be done quickly. I don't expect we'll solve them in Geneva tomorrow,"" he said of the talks with Lavrov. ""But we can advance our mutual understanding – and that, combined with de-escalation of Russia's military build-up on Ukraine's borders, that can turn us away from this crisis in the weeks ahead."" The secretary's remarks came as Pentagon officials warned that a Russian invasion may not initially unfold with tanks rolling into Ukraine, but rather, in the form of hybrid measures like cyberattacks, information operations, sabotage or air strikes — any of which ""could begin within days"" and allow Putin an opportunity to gauge the international reaction, one U.S. official said. The U.S. has also approved third-party transfers for NATO partners and allies, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom, to provide U.S. military equipment from their inventories for use by Ukraine, according to a State Department official. Recently the U.S. also authorized up to $200 million more in additional equipment support ""to meet Ukraine's emergency defense needs,"" the official said. In Washington, President Biden sought to walk back comments he made at a press conference Wednesday that suggested there could be divisions among Western nations about the consequences Russia could face if it launched a ""minor incursion"" into Ukrainian territory. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine alluded to the comment in a tweet in English reading, ""We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones. I say this as the President of a great power."" Mr. Biden, in an apparent effort to clarify his comments, said that he had been ""absolutely clear"" with Mr. Putin and that the Russian president had ""no misunderstanding"" that if ""any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that's an invasion."" Such an incursion ""will be met with severe and coordinated economic responses"" that the president said he had discussed in detail with allies and laid out ""very clearly"" for Putin himself. ""Let there be no doubt at all that, if Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price,"" Mr. Biden said, adding that the U.S. was prepared to address situations other than overt military action, including paramilitary tactics and cyberattacks. ""We have to be ready to respond to these as well,"" the president said. Asked if a small incursion by Russia would trigger sanctions, a senior Biden administration official also told reporters Wednesday, ""If Russia uses conventional military to acquire land forcibly, that will merit severe economic response."" ""We said previously 'invasion is an invasion.' That's what we mean by that — whether it's a small portion of territory or a large portion of territory,"" the same official added.

2022-01-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/havana-syndrome-cia-task-force-foreign-attacks-rule-out/,"CIA ""Havana Syndrome"" task force rules out foreign attacks in most reported cases in interim report","The Central Intelligence Agency has issued a set of interim findings on hundreds of reported cases of the mysterious neurological illness known as ""Havana Syndrome,"" ruling out in the ""majority"" of instances an attack by a foreign adversary, but vowing to intensify its focus on a group of two dozen ""priority"" cases that remain unexplained. ""We assess that the majority of reports of [anomalous health incidents] can be reasonably explained by medical conditions or environmental and technical factors, including previously undiagnosed illnesses,"" a senior CIA official said, using the term coined by the Biden administration to describe the incidents. Summarizing the findings of an internal CIA task force dedicated to investigating the cases, the official said, ""In this extensive investigation we have so far not found evidence of state-actor involvement in any incident,"" adding, ""[W]e assess it unlikely that a foreign actor, including Russia, is conducting a sustained, worldwide campaign, harming U.S. personnel with a weapon or mechanism."" However, the official emphasized, the agency's task force would continue investigating a small number of cases whose cause could not be determined. In those cases, the official said, the CIA has still ""not ruled out the involvement of a foreign actor."" ""There is a subset of cases, some of our toughest cases, that remain unresolved and remain the focus of active investigation,"" the official said, confirming they involved U.S. personnel from the CIA and other government agencies, but declining to specify where or when those incidents had occurred. In a statement, CIA Director William Burns said, ""We are pursuing this complex issue with analytic rigor, sound tradecraft, and compassion and have dedicated intensive resources to this challenge."" ""While we have reached some significant interim findings, we are not done. We will continue the mission to investigate these incidents and provide access to world-class care for those who need it,"" said Burns, who, since he was nominated to lead the agency, has repeatedly vowed to find answers and provide care to affected personnel. The CIA's findings, which reflect the intelligence community's current view, come amid an ongoing, government-wide effort to understand and identify the cause of the mysterious affliction, which is characterized by symptoms like nausea, dizziness, ear popping and headaches, and is often preceded by a sensation of heat or pressure. The incidents first gained prominence after they were reported by personnel at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. There has since been a stream of reports made by American diplomats, intelligence officers and military personnel stationed or traveling in countries worldwide — including Austria, Colombia, Germany, Serbia, India, Vietnam and others — many of which resulted in victims being medevaced to the U.S. for medical treatment. There have also been cases reported on U.S. soil, including in Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and Boston. In 2020, a study by the National Academies of Sciences commissioned by the State Department said the ""most plausible"" cause was ""directed, pulsed, radiofrequency energy."" That study, alongside other evidence circulated by current and former American officials, fueled unofficial hypotheses that the cases were the result of attempted intelligence collection by Russian or other government operatives who were using directed energy technologies or weapons. Burns has in the past said that Russia ""could be"" behind the incidents, but also allowed that there were ""a number of possibilities."" He also personally warned the Russians during meetings in Moscow last November of ""consequences"" if they were found to be involved. It was the second time the incidents were known to have been raised with Russia; they were also raised briefly during President Biden's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva last June. Burns personally witnessed a member of his staff suffer symptoms consistent with Havana Syndrome during a trip to Delhi, India, in September. The officer sought immediate medical care following the incident. Moscow has consistently denied involvement in the incidents, and no evidence has emerged publicly tying Russia to the illness. In early 2021, the Biden administration launched an intelligence review and established an expert panel of intelligence officers and medical experts to evaluate reported cases and the possible technologies behind them; its findings are expected to be delivered soon . National security adviser Jake Sullivan also appointed a senior director at the National Security Council to streamline data collection and lines of inquiry. As part of its efforts, the Biden administration and the agencies with personnel who have been affected encouraged employees to report health incidents they suspected might be linked to Havana Syndrome. The result was a significant influx of reports, many of which CIA officials acknowledged may have been made out of an ""abundance of caution"" and out of a growing awareness about the incidents among government employees. Over time, the drumbeat of reports began to resonate among the workforces at the State Department, Pentagon and CIA, whose employees were most often involved. Unease about the cause of the symptoms and concerns about several incidents that involved family members and children led some employees considering deployment overseas to waver, according to people familiar with the discussions. The continuing reports also prompted rare bipartisan action from Congress, which unanimously passed legislation, signed into law by President Biden last fall, designed to boost compensation and access to medical care for victims with confirmed brain injuries. The CIA and the State Department are currently working on establishing internal criteria for compensating victims who have suffered symptoms, as required by the legislation. Many U.S. officials affected by the syndrome struggled with debilitating symptoms for years, and paid out of pocket for diagnostic and medical care. As the cases gained prominence and Congress and the administration took action, many expressed a sense of relief that their experiences were being recognized and acknowledged as real by government leaders. A number of victims have also since begun receiving treatment at either Walter Reed or Johns Hopkins Medicine, both of which have established specialized programs for evaluating and treating the incidents. But victims' groups responded to the CIA's interim findings with concern and disappointment, and urged investigations into the incidents' cause to continue. ""[A]s the CIA itself acknowledges, not all the cases can be explained away. This cannot and must not be the last word on this matter, because it is neither definitive, nor comprehensive,"" the ""Advocacy for Victims of Havana Syndrome"" group said in a statement. ""We respectfully ask the President of the United States to tell the interagency to keep working and return to him at such time as they have a collective answer or hypothesis."" The group also called on congressional oversight committees to ""examine the conclusions"" and crafting of the report, as well as the decisions that led to its release. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said of the CIA's assessment, ""[I]t's important to note that today's assessment, while rigorously conducted, reflects only the interim work of the CIA task force."" ""The Senate Intelligence Committee will continue pressing for answers on a bipartisan basis, and we look forward to a final government report, as well as the conclusions of the outside experts panel that has been assembled to seek answers to these very urgent and difficult questions,"" Warner said. ""This is an extraordinarily difficult problem set, and a whole of government approach is required to solve it, using all the resources of the [intelligence community] and [Department of Defense], as well as open source and commercially available data,"" said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer who resigned a senior post after struggling with debilitating symptoms that began during a 2017 visit to Moscow. CIA officials who briefed reporters on the agency's interim findings said there was ""community agreement"" across U.S. intelligence agencies that there was no evidence of a global campaign being waged by a foreign actor, though some intelligence agencies had differing confidence levels in that assessment. They also said the task force had worked closely with other U.S. and foreign government partners in looking into the matter. The National Security Council referred questions about the CIA's findings and process back to the agency. The officials noted that there were no common characteristics among the unexplained cases, which complicated efforts to understand their cause. ""This has been one of the conundrums and really what has made this harder than probably any other we've looked at analytically in the agency's history, there definitely aren't patterns in the data,"" one CIA official said of the analysis done to date by the task force, which, the official said, would remain ""fully staffed, fully resourced and fully invested in its mission."" But something about the outstanding cases at least suggest that they may pave the way to more answers in the future. ""We are focused most intensely on this couple of dozen because we view those as the most likely to produce progress at this point,"" the official said. ""[I]f and as we receive additional reports from our colleagues that have concerning phenomena or symptoms, we are going to be investigating and reporting them, and we don't want to prejudge what we're going to find,"" the CIA official said.",20,5.207737856451116,3.8666329634056393,1.3411048930454768,18

Tension between the two global powers continues to rise, with President Biden saying on Wednesday that it was his ""guess"" Russian President Vladimir Putin would use the roughly 100,000 forces he has massed along the border to ""move in"" to Ukraine. ""He has to do something,"" Mr. Biden said during a White House news conference, warning that if Putin did decide to invade his neighbor, Russia would suffer ""consequential"" loss of life. The president didn't elaborate on the level of military assistance the U.S. might offer Ukraine in the face of an invasion, but it came as his administration worked with NATO allies to bolster Ukraine's forces — and quickly. U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that the Biden administration had given permission to several NATO allies to send emergency shipments of U.S.-made weapons — including anti-tank missiles — to Ukraine to reinforce the country's defenses. State Department sources said allies including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the U.K. were cleared to make ""Third Party Transfers"" of U.S.-made and supplied equipment to Ukraine, which one official described as part of a race ""to get as much gear to the Ukrainians as quickly as possible."" Russia, meanwhile, was moving military hardware and troops into Belarus — a close Russian ally that borders not only Ukraine, but also Lithuania, Latvia and Poland — for military exercises set to take place in February. American officials have voiced concern that Russia could use its troop presence in Belarus as another route to stage an overt invasion of Ukraine, or a so-called ""false-flag"" operation to create a ""pretext for invasion."" Russia's defense ministry also announced on Thursday that it would conduct naval exercises ""in all areas of responsibility of its fleets,"" including the Mediterranean, the northern Arctic seas, the northeastern Atlantic and in the Pacific Ocean. The drills, to take place in January and February, will involve more than 140 ships, 60 aircraft and about 10,000 forces, the ministry said. The ministry said the drills would cover regions of seas and oceans adjacent to Russian territory, as well as what the Russian military called ""operationally important areas"" of other bodies of water. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Germany on Thursday, where he met with allies who, by President Biden's own admission, are not all on the ""same page"" about the level of sanctions to impose on Russia should Putin choose to invade his neighbor again. Russian forces last openly invaded Ukraine in 2014, when Putin unilaterally annexed the Crimean Peninsula. American officials have played down divisions within NATO over how much pressure to exert on Russia. The U.S. and Britain, for instance, have extended direct military aid to Ukraine, while Germany has declined to do so. There was scant immediate reaction from EU capitals to President Biden's tough rhetoric on Thursday, but French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe should have its own negotiations with Russia and not rely on the U.S. to speak for it. Asked about the divisions among allies, a senior State Department official insisted to CBS News on Thursday that there was ""universal agreement on the steep costs"" Russia must be forced to pay if it does invade, and the U.S. and its allies were ""in the process of finalizing the mechanics"" on how to ensure that could be done. Blinken, asked on Thursday to clarify Mr. Biden's remarks from the previous day, when he indicated that any U.S. response to a Russian invasion may be adjusted depending on the scale of Russia's actions, said the administration had been ""very clear throughout: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border and commit new acts of aggression against Ukraine, that will be met with a swift, severe response from the United States and our allies and partners."" After Blinken's meetings on Thursday with French, German and British officials in Berlin, the State Department said the diplomats had discussed ""joint efforts to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine, including Allies' and partners' readiness to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia for such actions."" The biggest outstanding question, from the perspective of U.S. officials and their allies, had not changed as Blinken prepared for his Friday meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov: What does Putin really want? Kremlin officials have insisted that Russia has no plans or intentions to invade Ukraine, and Putin and his top aides insist it is the U.S. and NATO fueling animosity by threatening sanctions and moving military hardware and personnel close to Russia's western borders. But Moscow also issues continual warnings of military action if Putin's demands are not met — chiefly his insistence that NATO reject Ukraine's bid for membership. The Biden administration has called that demand a non-starter, but both sides have shown a willingness to at least keep talking, most notably with the Friday meeting between Blinken and Lavrov on the neutral ground in Geneva. Despite President Biden's ""guess"" on Wednesday, American officials say they still don't know for certain if Putin has decided to launch an invasion of Ukraine, on any scale, or whether the brinkmanship is merely intended to extract concessions from the U.S. and NATO as Moscow seeks what it calls ""security guarantees."" Mr. Biden said on Wednesday that he didn't believe Putin wanted a ""full-blown war,"" but that he expected the Russian leader to test the U.S. and NATO's resolve as much as possible. State Department officials have said they still don't know what Putin is thinking, but they're planning for all eventualities. A large part of Blinken's mission when he meets Lavrov on Friday will no doubt be to assess, to the extent possible, Moscow's intentions.

The intelligence agency said a majority of the 1,000 cases reported to the government can be explained by environmental causes, undiagnosed medical conditions or stress, rather than a sustained global campaign by a foreign power. U.S. officials said the CIA believes it's unlikely that Russia or another foreign adversary is using microwaves or other forms of directed energy to attack hundreds of American diplomats and intelligence officers who attribute their brain injuries and other symptoms. The findings are drawing criticism from those who have reported cases and from advocates who accuse the government of long dismissing the array of ailments. Former Senior CIA Intelligence Officer Marc Polymeropoulos said a work trip to Moscow changed his life and ended his 26-year career. ""I awoke in the middle of the night. It was an incredible case of vertigo. The room was spinning. I had terrible headaches. I felt like I was going to be nauseous. It started a long medical journey of a headache that never goes away,"" he said. His headaches and nausea were consistent with symptoms that have been referred to as 'Havana syndrome.' The first cases were reported by U.S. embassy and intelligence officials in Cuba in 2016. Scientists had suspected the cause of the symptoms were directed, radio-frequency energy. ""This is really a silent injury, a silent wound,"" Polymeropoulos said. US Lawmakers had raised concern about what's been described as an increasing pattern of suspected attacks. The Russian government was widely suspected to be involved, but the U.S. government had not officially blamed anyone for the incidents. (© Copyright 2022 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

2022-01-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-united-states-antony-blinken-military-aid-war/,"Blinken visits Ukraine as U.S. boosts military support by $200 million, urges Russia to choose a ""peaceful path""","Moscow — The Biden administration announced an additional $200 million in military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, bolstering U.S. support for the country amid fears of a potential Russian invasion. ""We are committed to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and will continue to provide Ukraine the support it needs,"" a U.S. State Department official told reporters traveling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as he headed to Ukraine's capital city. Blinken was in Kyiv on Wednesday to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. The visit came as Washington and its European allies stepped up their warnings to Russia that any assault on Ukraine would bring ""massive consequences."" Russia has already massed more than 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine. In Kyiv, Blinken said he hoped Russia would continue diplomacy and remain on a ""peaceful path,"" but he said Moscow appeared poised for ""aggressive action."" ""We know that there are plans in place to increase that [Russian] force even more on very short notice, and that gives President Putin the capacity, also on very short notice, to take further aggressive action against Ukraine,"" he told diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine's capital on Wednesday. ""I strongly, strongly hope that we can keep this on a diplomatic and peaceful path, but ultimately, that's going to be President Putin's decision."" Blinken is scheduled to meet his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in Geneva on Friday. President Zelenskyy extended his thanks to America on Wednesday for its backing. ""I would like to thank you personally,"" he told Blinken, ""and President Biden and the U.S. administration, for your support, for military assistance to Ukraine, for increasing this assistance."" ""We understand that to take steps quickly to modernize the army, we need help, especially in these... difficult times,"" the Ukrainian leader said. Talks last week between U.S., NATO and Russian officials failed to bridge stark disagreements over how to resolve the standoff along the Ukraine-Russia border. Moscow has issued a number of security demands, the main one being that NATO rule out admitting new members along Russia's western flank — including a guarantee that Ukraine will never join the alliance. U.S. officials have ruled out any such commitment, insisting that only NATO will decide which nations to welcome as members. The American side said it was prepared to discuss certain security matters, such as military exercises and deployments in the region, but Russia has shown no inclination to let the U.S. pick and choose the topics of future negotiations. U.S. officials have said they're not sure whether Putin has made a decision to invade Ukraine, or whether the saber-rattling is just aimed at extracting security commitments from the West, without an outright conflict. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports, Washington has voiced concern that Russia could launch a so-called false-flag operation — a staged incident that it uses as a pretext for an invasion. Those fears were only compounded by Russia's announcement on Tuesday that it will send forces into Belarus next month for joint military exercises with its ally. Russia considers NATO's presence in the region, and certainly any moves to bolster it, a threat. But Williams, who's made multiple trips to the front line in eastern Ukraine in recent months, says many people in that country believe Putin is playing a Cold War-style game of brinkmanship, trying to extract concessions from America and its allies — and they worry it could escalate quickly. Williams visited one of the dozens of Cold War-era bunkers across Ukraine that have been renovated and reopened after decades – this time to protect civilians not from the potential American attacks they were designed for, but from Russian weapons. Russia continues to send mixed signals, insisting it has no plans or intentions of attacking Ukraine, but warning that it will resort to ""military-technical"" means if talks with the U.S. fail. It has brushed off calls to withdraw its troops from the border region, saying it's free to move forces around as it pleases on its own territory. ""I am sure that there is no risk of a large-scale war that could unfold in Europe or anywhere else. We do not intend to take any aggressive action,"" senior Russian diplomat Sergey Ryabkov, who has led the negotiations with the U.S., said on Wednesday. ""We do not intend to attack or invade Ukraine."" He added that Moscow was still waiting for a written response from NATO to Russia's security demands. ""As the Russian side has repeatedly emphasized, the issue is urgent, we are not ready to wait indefinitely, we are not ready to plunge into the usual diplomatic, bureaucratic mess about what formats are optimal for this. We need a direct and understandable answer, in writing,"" he said. U.S. and European leaders have been united in condemning Russia's actions, but there's less unity about how to deter Moscow. The U.S., Britain, Canada, and Turkey have increased military assistance, sending experts, anti-tank missiles and armed drones, and helping Ukraine rebuild its Navy, among other things. Europe's biggest economy, however, Germany, appears to be treading more cautiously, declining to provide direct military aid. Russia, meanwhile, has been keen to show strong relations with its own allies, including with the announcement earlier this week about the large-scale, joint military drills next month in Belarus, which also shares a border with Ukraine and European allies Lithuania and Poland. Those war games, and the Russian forces taking part in them, could create yet another pathway for a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia is also to hold a joint naval exercise with Chinese and Iranian forces, the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet confirmed on Tuesday, without providing exact timings.",4,3.254004629053166,1.969520870338105,1.284483758715061,17
2022-01-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-blinken-meeting-ukraine-border-buildup/,Blinken to meet Russian counterpart amid rising concerns over buildup near Ukraine,"The U.S.' top diplomat is scheduled to meet with Russia's foreign minister in Geneva on Friday following visits to Ukraine and Germany in an effort to deescalate tensions as Russia builds up more forces near Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken departed Tuesday for a series of stops aimed at a diplomatic solution to the threat Russia is posing on Ukraine's borders. In Kyiv on Wednesday, Blinken will meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian leaders. From there, he will travel to Berlin, where he will consult with German, French and British counterparts. And on Friday he is scheduled to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva. Blinken's travel follows a trip to Kyiv last Wednesday by CIA Director Wiliam Burns, who met with intelligence counterparts and spoke with President Zelenskyy about ""assessments of risk"" to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official. A senior state department official said Tuesday that Russia's willingness to continue talks revived what had been diminishing hopes that a military invasion could be forestalled. ""[T]he fact that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov agreed to meet on Friday in Geneva suggests that perhaps diplomacy is not dead,"" the official said. """"Russia has two choices: diplomacy and de-escalation, or escalation and massive consequences,"" the official continued. ""The United States remains committed to diplomacy and believes it is the best and most responsible way forward."" Russia has already amassed an estimated 100,000 troops near its borders with Ukraine and has started positioning defense units in Belarus to the north of Ukraine for joint exercises. ""We're now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack on Ukraine,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. ""I would say that's more stark than we have been."" In a call with reporters, the senior State Department official also described the movement of Russian forces into Belarus as ""neither an exercise nor normal troop movement,"" and ""a show of strength designed to cause or give false pretext for a crisis as Russia plans for a possible invasion."" ""The fact that we're seeing this movement of forces into Belarus clearly gives the Russians another approach, should they decide to take further military action against Ukraine,"" the official said. CBS News reported Friday that Ukrainian officials are concerned Russia might use alternative methods of attack, including potentially a staged provocation originating from within neighboring Belarus or another Russia-friendly territory in the region, as a predicate to invade Ukraine. Another senior State Department official warned Tuesday that Russia is preying on Belarus's ongoing instability, as well as on what the official described as President Alexander Lukashenka's ""self-inflicted vulnerability"". ""Lukashenka has relied more and more on Russia for all kinds of support, and we know that Putin doesn't give that support for free. It's clear Russia is preying on Lukashenka's vulnerability and calling in some of those accumulated I.O.U.s,"" the senior official said. The official also highlighted that Mr. Putin is an opportunist and so any movement that increases capability should be taken seriously. According to Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, the Department of Defense does not believe Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a decision yet on whether to further invade Ukraine. ""[Putin] clearly is building up a force posture there that provides him multiple options,"" Kirby said Tuesday. ""The option that we would prefer is for him to de-escalate, to take the tensions down and of course one of the easiest ways to do that is remove some of that force presence."" The Biden administration is pushing forward with a diplomatic approach but is preparing for options such as economic sanctions if diplomacy fails and Russia launches an incursion. President Joe Biden in December ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine if Russia invades. Kirby told reporters on Tuesday the administration will continue to look for ways to help Ukraine defend itself but had no new announcements to make. Currently, there are about 250 members of the Florida National Guard in Ukraine assisting and advising Ukrainian defense forces as a part of a rotational mission that began in the wake of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. The Department of Defense has provided over $2.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014, including $450 million in 2021, according to a U.S. defense official.",4,3.245903338914893,4.596181624745299,-1.3502782858304059,26

""In terms of sanctions, what we have laid out is a very clear message to the Russians, and we've done so in concert and in unison with our allies that if they do further invade Ukraine, there will be severe economic consequences and a price to pay,"" Sullivan said in an interview with ""Face the Nation."" ""If it turns out that Russia is pummeling Ukraine with cyberattacks, and if that continues over the period ahead, we will work with our allies on the appropriate response."" The Biden administration has been pursuing a diplomatic response to the build-up of tanks and more than 100,000 Russian forces along Ukraine's eastern border, and it has been clear it prefers the diplomatic route. U.S. and Russian diplomats met in Geneva, Switzerland, last week to try to defuse the security crisis involving Ukraine. Still, Sullivan said that if Russia does take military action, the U.S. will ""take measures that go at their economy, that go at their strategic position in Europe, that strengthen the solidarity of NATO."" ""We're ready either way. If Russia wants to move forward with diplomacy, we are absolutely ready to do that in lockstep with our allies and partners. If Russia wants to go down the path of invasion and escalation, we're ready for that too, with a robust response that will cut off their strategic position,"" he said. ""So, from our perspective, we are pursuing simultaneously deterrence and diplomacy, and we've been clear and steadfast in that again, fully united with the transatlantic community."" The threat of a Russian invasion into Ukraine has continued to intensify, and U.S. officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin could order military action as soon as this month or February. While Russia has sent mixed signals about a possible invasion, it has not indicated there will be a reduction in its troop presence, and Putin has demanded NATO scale back its troop presence in Eastern Europe, among other security guarantees. Amid the rising tensions, Ukrainian government servers were hit with a cyberattack late last week that brought government websites down. Hours before the cyber offensive, Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told CBS News the country believes such an attack would come before major military action by Putin's troops. Sullivan said the Biden administration has been warning for months that cyberattacks could be part of a ""broad-based Russian effort to escalate in Ukraine,"" and the U.S. has been working with the Ukrainian government to harden their defenses. ""That's part of their playbook. They've done it in the past in other contexts,"" he said. Still, Sullivan said the Biden administration has not yet attributed the cyberattack, but added, ""it would not surprise me one bit if it ends up being attributed to Russia.""",4,1.631970391904114,3.2550280529310482,-1.6230576610269343,9
2022-01-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-russia-arrests-revil/,Russia arrests 14 alleged members of REvil ransomware gang,"Russia's domestic intelligence service announced a special operation campaign against the notorious criminal ransomware group, REvil, Friday. According to the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russian authorities raided 25 addresses, resulting in the arrest of 14 individuals and seizure of more than $1 million worth of assets: 426 million rubles, $600,000, 500,000 euros, computer equipment, crypto wallets and 20 luxury cars. The Russia-based REvil gang has waged a spate of high-profile attacks on major U.S. and international companies, including the July 4 attack on software company Kaseya and a May ransomware attack on JBS USA, the world's largest meat processing company. Earlier this year, REvil reportedly demanded $50 million from Apple ahead of its product launch after hacking one of its suppliers, Quanta Computer. Associates of the criminal ransomware group have been linked to the May shut down of Colonial Pipeline, the nation's largest oil producer. The FSB's announcement came as Ukraine scrambled to respond to a cyber attack shutting down its public-facing government websites, including the homepage for the Foreign Ministry, which temporarily displayed a message warning Ukrainians to ""be afraid and expect the worst."" Ukraine's security service said, Friday, ""there are some signs of involvement [by] hacker groups associated with the Russian secret services."" The FSB claimed those arrested Friday, had ""developed malicious software and organized the theft of funds from the bank accounts of foreign citizens and cashed them out, including by purchasing expensive goods on the Internet."" ""As a result of the joint actions of the FSB and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, the organized criminal group ceased to exist,"" the statement boasted. The White House acknowledged, Friday, that one of the hackers arrested had been involved in the Colonial Pipeline incident. ""We understand that one of the individuals who was arrested today was responsible for the attack against Colonial Pipeline last spring,"" a senior administration official briefed reporters, Friday. ""We're committed to seeing those conducting ransomware attacks against Americans brought to justice."" The FSB also handed out footage depicting agents raiding homes, tackling suspects to the floor, handcuffing individuals with blurred-out faces and sorting through stacks of Russian rubles. Suspected REvil hacker Roman Muromsky, 33, has been detained following the raids, though it's unclear if the former leader of cybercriminal gang EvilCorp appears in the handout video. Moscow's Tverskoi District Court has placed the Muromsky, a Russian national suspected of illegal trafficking of means of payment, in custody for two months. ""The court has granted the motion from the investigation to select two-month custody until March 13 as a measure of restraint for Roman Gennadyevich Muromsky,"" court spokesperson Kseniya Rozina said Friday. The court has also jailed Andrei Bessonov, Russian news agencies reported, Friday. But Russia won't extradite to the U.S. those members of the REvil hacker group who have Russian citizenship, a knowledgeable source told Interfax Friday. ""The law of the Russian Federation prohibits extradition of Russian citizens to a foreign state,"" the source said, without specifying whether all the detained hackers were Russian nationals. In their statement, the FSB said Friday's investigation came at ""the request of competent US authorities,"" who were later ""informed about the results of the operation."" The U.S.-Russia collaboration marks a bright spot in an otherwise tense moment for the two countries, following a week of failed diplomatic efforts to curb Russia's military buildup bordering on Ukraine. As Ukraine's communication intelligence service responds to the cyberattacks targeting as many as 70 of its websites, U.S. and Ukrainian officials tell CBS News that the Kremlin is actively preparing the battlefield by using information warfare. ""These arrests are another example of the significant actions taken by the United States to curb the multifaceted extortion crisis. Threat actors are reevaluating whether they should continue their criminal activities in light of the arrests and indictments,"" Charles Carmakal, SVP and CTO of Mandiant told CBS News. ""Still, the timing is strange here,"" Ken Westin, Director of Security Strategy for Cybereason cautioned, in an interview with CBS News. The Russian-led raids ""could be a smokescreen or red herring."" ""Taking down a ransomware leader is like cutting the head off a hydra,"" Westin added. ""New leaders will step in to fill the void. The relationship between ransomware gangs and Russian APT groups are well known and the true actors behind these groups will continue to operate with impunity."" On Thursday, prior to public reports of the Russian-led REvil operation, U.S. Secret Service cyber chief Jeremy Sheridan told the Washington Post that ransomware criminal actors often mature, evolve or adjust, reappearing under different facades. ""With these small groups working with illicit exchanges, there's an expression that a colleague of mine uses,"" Sheridan said. ""It's the same 200 people chasing the same 200 people. There are certainly the influx of new actors in this space. But a lot of times what we see with a new variant or a new cyberattack, it's the same developers who have just changed their technology to some degree."" Last summer, the State Department offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of key REvil group leaders. In November, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced seizure of more than $6 million in cryptocurrency after REvil leader and Russian national Yevgeniy Igorevich Polyanin, scooped up $13 million from ransomware victims. The suspected ""author"" of the REVIL ransomware, Polyanin, has been charged with 14 counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer, and money laundering.

The official told CBS News on Friday the Russian operatives were ""trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia's own proxy-forces,"" and could take action ""several weeks before a military invasion, which could begin between mid-January and mid-February."" The National Security Council declined to specify where the Russian teams were thought to be located. ""When we talk about Russian operatives, it could represent a blend of individuals inside the Russian government, whether from their intelligence communities, their security services, or even their military,"" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said Friday. ""They often hybridize their personnel to such a degree that the lines are not necessarily really clear on who, specifically, they report to in the conduct of some of these more covert and clandestine operations."" Kirby also said it was unlikely Russia's activities would happen ""without the knowledge, if not the imprimatur, of the very senior levels of the Russian government."" Online, Russian actors have also been fabricating ""Ukrainian provocations in state and social media to justify a Russian intervention and sow divisions in Ukraine,"" the U.S. official said, noting there was a 200% increase last month in Russian-language narratives blaming the West and Ukrainian authorities for escalating tensions. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Thursday the moves were reminiscent of Russia's actions eight years ago, ahead of its invasion and occupation of Crimea. ""We saw this playbook in 2014. They are preparing this playbook again,"" Sullivan said. He said the U.S. is ready to respond to Russia if it abandons diplomatic talks in favor of military aggression, but said the U.S. intelligence community had not determined that Moscow had ""definitively decided"" to mount a Ukraine invasion. ""We're ready to make progress at the negotiating table – serious, tangible progress on important issues of concern to us, to Europe, and to Russia in an environment of de-escalation,"" Sullivan said. ""And we're ready to take the necessary and proper steps to defend our allies, support our partners, and respond robustly to any naked aggression that might occur."" His comments followed several days of intensive but largely fruitless diplomacy among the U.S., NATO, European nations and Russia, which has amassed 100,000 troops at its border with Ukraine and recently conducted live-fire drills with troops and heavy artillery. Moscow has for weeks been demanding security guarantees from the West that include a commitment that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO. NATO and the U.S. have repeatedly dismissed that demand as a ""non-starter,"" while signaling a willingness to engage with Russia on issues related to arms control, missile placement and transparency into military activities. On Friday, Ukrainian officials said multiple government websites had suffered a ""massive cyberattack"" that downed them temporarily. President Biden was briefed on the attack but the U.S. has not yet determined who was behind it, said a National Security Council spokesperson. Just hours earlier, Ukraine's ambassador in Washington told CBS News her country believed a cyberattack would precede any major military action by Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg condemned the cyberattacks and said the alliance was actively ""supporting the Ukrainian authorities on the ground.""

Just hours before the latest digital sabotage, Ukraine's ambassador in Washington told CBS News that her country believed a cyberattack would precede any major military action by Vladimir Putin's forces. There was no claim of responsibility for the cyberattack, but Ukraine has blamed groups with links to the Russian government for similar previous sabotage. ""As a result of a massive cyberattack, the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies are temporarily down,"" the Foreign Ministry said overnight. Earlier, the ministry's website displayed a message in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish saying: ""Ukrainians! All your personal data... have been deleted and are impossible to restore. All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst."" Ukrainian and U.S. officials told CBS News on Thursday that a potential military assault against Ukraine would not necessarily begin with Russian tanks rolling across the frozen border in the coming weeks. Alternate methods of attack, including airstrikes as well as a staged provocation that could originate from neighboring Belarus or other Russia-friendly territory in the region, were among the possibilities expected — along with a preceding cyberattack. Putin's preference for hybrid warfare is also particularly weighing on the minds of Ukrainian officials. ""If Russia decides on a full invasion, then we know that we should expect increased cyberattacks before that,"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told CBS News on Thursday. Russian cyber offensives have been a near constant for years and they span a range of debilitating attacks on infrastructure, from disabling electric grids to active disinformation campaigns run by Russia aimed at turning the Ukrainian public against their own government. The ensuing confusion and division could prove useful to Russian interests. The assumption is that Russian President Vladimir Putin may attempt to use such tactics to predicate a military attack. President Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan alluded to U.S. intelligence about Russian sabotage during a briefing at the White House on Thursday. ""Our intelligence community has developed information, which has now been downgraded, that Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for an invasion — including through sabotage activities and information operations — by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine,"" Sullivan told reporters. A National Security Council spokesperson did not elaborate when asked by CBS News about Sullivan's comments. On Friday, an NCS spokesperson told CBS News that President Biden had been briefed on the cyberattack, but that the council had not yet determined who was behind the sabotage. The U.S. has sent cyber teams to Ukraine in recent weeks to help advise the country's own security services, multiple sources confirmed to CBS News. Cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch said he doubted that a cyber attack would be the primary method used in any Russian offensive, but rather that it would be used to 'prepare the battlefield'. ""I expect that kinetic actions will take precedence in the offensive but cyber attacks will be used for intelligence purposes,"" Alperovitch told CBS. The Pentagon declined to describe the extent of support being provided to Ukraine. ""We have long supported Ukraine's efforts to shore up cyber defenses and increase its cyber resiliency, but have nothing further to offer at this time,"" a Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement emailed to CBS News. Tensions between Russia and the West are sky-high, with 100,000 Russian forces massed along Ukraine's eastern border and U.S. officials warning that Putin could order another invasion of the neighboring nation as soon as this month or February. War has raged in eastern Ukraine between the country's forces and Russian-backed separatists since 2014, when Russia invaded and seized the Crimean Peninsula. Moscow has sent mixed signals, insisting there are no plans to invade again, but showing no inclination to reduce its troop presence along the border and warning military action could be taken any time if the U.S. and its NATO allies refuse to make ""security guarantees."" Chief among the demands from Moscow is that Ukraine's bid to become a NATO member be blocked. The U.S. has dismissed that demand as a ""non-starter."" The Biden administration has also made clear that its preferred route of diplomacy cannot make headway unless there is a climate of de-escalation, with Russia returning troops to their barracks and becoming transparent about its military movements. The risk of a full frontal military invasion still remains high, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. If Putin were to go ahead with a full invasion, using tanks during the frozen winter months of January and February, his forces would face a Ukrainian military armed with javelin missiles and other U.S.-provided weaponry, as well as a long battle frontier given Ukraine's size. But, from Ukraine's perspective, neither the risk of a military incursion nor Russia's efforts to destabilize the country via other means are likely to fade with the spring thaw. American diplomats, led by the State Department's Wendy Sherman, continue to lead talks in an effort to persuade Putin to change his calculus. Thus far, the efforts have not led Russia to pullback. On Thursday, Putin's government labeled the talks ""unsuccessful,"" and Friday Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov doubled down on the Kremlin's ""red line"" on Ukrainian NATO membership. Lavrov said if the security talks with the West fail, Russia's response could entail a deployment of military hardware. On Thursday, his deputy said Russia ""won't exclude"" putting military hardware in Cuba or Venezuela. ""So far we don't see Russian military units pulling back or stopping exercises near the border,"" Ukrainian Ambassador Markarova told CBS News. ""So Putin is still using it as a threat and as an instrument to get the West to talk to him."" ""He is also prepared to invade again if he believes that there is a window of opportunity,"" added the diplomat. Ukraine is urging the U.S. and NATO to apply greater political pressure, including by hitting Russia with more economic sanctions, and by strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities. Earlier this week, the U.S. government's cybersecurity agency CISA issued a public warning intended to prepare U.S. critical infrastructure for possible fallout of any large-scale Russian cyberattack. As CBS News' Nicole Sganga reported, this is being done in an effort to avoid an international spillover effect, such as what occurred after the 2017 Notpetya attack, which had global ramifications.

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, who led negotiations with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman in Geneva this week, said Thursday that he didn't want ""to confirm anything, [but] won't exclude anything here either,"" when asked whether Russia might consider establishing a military presence in America's backyard. ""It depends on the actions of American colleagues,"" Ryabkov said Thursday in an interview with the RTVI channel, adding that Russia could also undertake unspecified ""measures"" involving its navy. It was a significant ratcheting up of the tension between the U.S. and Russia in a week that many hoped would put diplomacy front and center. The current standoff between Moscow and Washington has been casually framed as a contemporary echo of the Cold War for weeks, but Ryabkov's remarks were sure to resonate loudly in the ears of Americans either aware of or old enough to remember the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. There was no immediate reaction from Russia's allies in Havana or Caracas to Ryabkov's remarks. A few weeks ago, Moscow sent Washington a list of ""security guarantees"" demanding that NATO halt its eastward expansion and, most importantly, close the door for Ukraine to join the alliance. Following high-stakes talks in Geneva and Brussels this week, Sherman called some of Moscow's demands ""simply non-starters."" ""We will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy,"" she told reporters on Wednesday. ""We are not going to agree that NATO cannot expand any further."" Russia's military has massed about 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine, stoking fears that it could be preparing for another invasion of the country as it did in 2014, when Vladimir Putin sent in his forces and annexed the Crimean Peninsula. U.S. officials have said an invasion could begin as soon as January or February and involve as many as 175,000 Russian troops. Russian officials have sent mixed signals on whether Putin indeed plans to attack Ukraine, denying any intention to do so outright, but stressing that all options remain on the table in the standoff, including military action to ""counter threats"" if the West refuses to agree to its demands. ""The jury's out on which path Vladimir Putin is going to choose,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told MSNBC on Thursday. ""Is he going to choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue to resolve some of these problems or is he going to pursue confrontation and aggression?"" Moscow has seen Ukraine as a potential security threat since elections there ushered in new leadership that severed longtime close ties with Russia and instead shifted the country's alliance to the West. Ukraine is actively seeking NATO membership. In talks with NATO on Wednesday, Russia said that if the Western security alliance wants to ""deescalate"" the situation around Ukraine, it must ""abandon all military assistance to Ukraine and stop supplying weaponry."" Earlier on Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the Russian-U.S. talks over Moscow's demanded security guarantees ""unsuccessful,"" and slammed the U.S. over new sanctions drafted in Congress targeting senior Russian officials amid the push for diplomatic détente. ""We view such documents and such statements in an extremely negative way — especially against the backdrop of continuing negotiations, which may be unsuccessful but are still talks,"" Peskov said during a daily briefing call with reporters. The proposed package of sanctions submitted by U.S. senators on Wednesday, with support from the White House, is intended to ""devastate"" the Russian economy should Moscow attack Ukraine. The measures include personal sanctions against Putin and several other top officials, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. ""Introducing sanctions against the head of the government or the head of Russia is an extreme measure which is comparable to severing relations,"" Peskov said. According to the draft, the U.S. government would also have to investigate and present a report on Putin's personal wealth and assets held by his family members, or any other people who may be holding them on his behalf. The last round of talks between Russia and the West, this time under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), was to wrap up on Thursday. As Poland begins its year-long chairmanship of that security organization, the country's Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau warned that the risk of war in Europe was ""now greater than ever before in the last 30 years."" ""For several weeks we have been faced with the prospect of a major military escalation in Eastern Europe,"" Rau said, addressing the 57-member alliance of nations. Russia's Ryabkov said that Moscow would decide on its next actions after it receives a written response to its demands, which it expected next week.",4,1.3182731155046945,1.353843316306632,-0.0355702008019374,17
2022-01-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-russia-ukraine-war-frontline-ukrainian-troops-brace-putin-invasion/,"As the U.S. and Russia talk, Ukrainian troops brace for war, and they're ""ready for battle""","Eastern Ukraine — U.S. and Russian diplomats were meeting on Monday in Geneva, Switzerland, to try to defuse a potential military showdown in Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies, including Ukraine, are worried that Russia could invade its neighbor again, as it did in 2014 when Vladimir Putin's forces seized the Crimean Peninsula. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams is in eastern Ukraine, speaking with military leaders who are preparing for a potential war with Russia, and hoping to prevent another land-grab. The Cold War ended 30 years ago with the collapse of the Soviet empire. But Williams found Ukrainian soldiers fighting — with help from the United States — against separatists backed by Russia, and the U.S. government has warned that Russia could be on the brink of a new invasion. On the frozen frontline of the conflict, Williams was led through icy trenches that have carved the country in two. Ukraine is an American ally that has been fighting a bloody, Russian-backed rebellion since 2014. More than 14,000 people have reportedly been killed in those seven years. Commander Andriy, a 22-year veteran of Ukraine's armed forces, is worried. He believes there's a very real chance that Putin will order his forces to invade once again. This winter, Russia has massed as many as 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border. It has also tested its new hypersonic missiles, which may be capable of evading American air defense systems. Some analysts believe a full Russian ground invasion, with tanks, artillery and armored vehicles rolling over the border, would only be possible after the ground here freezes solid, but in the trenches, troops told CBS News they believe it could happen any time. Putin rejects the concerns voiced by Ukraine, the U.S. and its NATO allies, insisting that it's Russia suffering at the hands of Western aggression. He has demanded security guarantees from the U.S. and NATO, including removing NATO troops from much of eastern Europe. But some say Putin is playing a game of Cold War-style brinkmanship. ""He wants to be treated like a great leader. He wants Russia to be treated like a great power,"" Ukrainian political analyst Taras Berezovets told CBS News. He believes Putin is merely using Ukraine, and the threat of a new invasion, as a pawn to get what he wants from the West. ""He thinks that if he shows his power here, he shows violence here, in Ukraine… Western leaders can say, 'Okay, we should deal with Putin and should treat him like we used to treat Soviet Union and communist leaders.'"" The U.S. has been helping to train Ukraine's frontline soldiers. Last year, Washington supplied nearly half a billion dollars in military assistance, including anti-tank missiles. In two phone calls with Putin last month, President Biden threatened Moscow with more sanctions if Russia does invade, but he said he would not send American troops. Some analysts think Putin believes the U.S. is in decline as a superpower, and that he senses an opportunity for Russia to gain clout on the world stage, at the expense of the democratic West. ""From his perspective, he thinks that democracy [is] becoming weaker, weaker and weaker,"" Berezovets told Williams. Hundreds of miles from the frontline, in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, they've renovated old bomb shelters for civilians to use in case of a Russian attack. Williams visited one of the shelters, which were originally built during the Cold War, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union and the enemy, ironically, was America. Back on the frontline, the troops in the trenches want no part of a new, Russian empire, even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice to prevent it. ""All my soldiers, in this time, ready for battle,"" Commander Andriy told CBS News. ""You're all ready to die to save Ukraine from Russian invasion?"" Williams asked him. ""Not only I, all my soldiers,"" he replied.",4,2.9233847002773317,3.3523789242337863,-0.4289942239564546,17

The White House is pushing back against a report that said the Biden administration might be willing to consider lowering troop levels in Eastern Europe if Russia would pull back its forces from near Ukraine, Christina Ruffini reports for ""CBS Saturday Morning."" A senior State Department official told reporters on Friday, ""I want to be crystal clear that that is not accurate."" But the Putin problem remains. ""Russia's aggressive actions are a threat to peace and security in Europe,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a rare Friday news conference. He threatened massive consequences for further Russian aggression in Europe, but said diplomacy is still an option. The U.S. wants Russia to reduce its troop presence along Ukraine's eastern border, where Russian forces annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia, in turn, has made its own demands, including that no new countries be allowed to join NATO. Both the U.S. and NATO have called that a nonstarter. ""We will not compromise on core principles, including the right for every nation to decide its own path, including what kind of security arrangements it wants to be a part of,"" said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. A U.S. intelligence report estimated the nearly 100,000 Russian forces near Ukraine could be ready to invade at the start of this year. This week, Russian paratroopers landed in neighboring Kazakhstan after its president requested help controlling anti-government protests. ""I think one lesson in recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave,"" said Blinken. President Biden has said U.S. forces won't be going into Ukraine, but they might be needed in NATO ally countries around Eastern Europe if Russia decides to venture past its border.",4,1.3958697854827542,2.023142988179618,-0.6272732026968639,17
2022-01-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-sends-troops-into-kazakhstan-as-protests-turn-deadly/,Russia sends troops into Kazakhstan as clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters turn deadly,"Moscow — Russia has sent military hardware and paratroopers to Kazakhstan as part of a ""peacekeeping"" mission following a plea from President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. The Kazakh leader has vowed to quash massive protests across the country that started over gas prices, but have quickly spiraled into a much more significant challenge to the authoritarian leadership of the former Soviet Republic. On Thursday the protests turned deadly. Police in Almaty, the country's biggest city, told local channel Khabar 24 that ""dozens"" of protesters had been ""liquidated"" following attempts to storm government buildings. State TV said 12 law enforcement officers were also killed, including two who were purportedly found beheaded. More than 1,000 people were injured across the country, health officials said. The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Moscow-led alliance of six former Soviet states —Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan — promptly approved Tokayev's request to send additional forces to back up his own security services. It was the first major action by the CSTO since it was founded more than 20 years ago. The CSTO did not confirm the size of the Russian deployment to Kazakhstan, but local media reported as many as 3,000 troops had been sent to back up the Kazakh forces. Kazakhstan has been engulfed in anti-government riots throughout the week, which began with grievances over fuel prices but quickly turned political. Protesters demanded a change in power and a complete withdrawal of Tokayev's mentor and predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, from politics. Nazarbayev handpicked Tokayev in 2019 as he stepped down as the first president of the country, but he remained the head of the Security Council, enjoying significant influence. As the protests grew this week, Tokayev removed Nazarbayev from his post and sacked Kazakhstan's cabinet, but vowed that the government would not fall. Authorities have imposed a nationwide state of emergency and a night-time curfew. Virtually all flights, both domestic and international, were canceled in Kazakhstan and train connections were disrupted, officials said. The CSTO said the Russian paratroopers, who were to be joined soon by forces from other member nations, planned to ensure ""security of important government and military sites"" and assist Kazakh law enforcement in ""stabilizing the situation."" Kazakhstan is a close strategic ally of Russia, which is very sensitive to any unrest in the former Soviet Republics. The deteriorating situation in Kazakhstan presents a fresh challenge for President Vladimir Putin, as he has long sought to make his country the primary power in the region. ""Kazakhstan is another test, after Belarus, of Russia's ability to help stabilize its formal allies without alienating their populations,"" Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in a tweet. ""Lots of potential pitfalls around, but can be a big boon if Moscow succeeds."" The violence in Kazakhstan comes amid soaring tension along Russia's western borders, as Moscow presses the West to sign legally binding guarantees that NATO will refrain from any eastward expansion. Most importantly, Putin has demanded that the U.S. and its European allies deny Ukraine's bid for membership in the transatlantic security alliance. Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border, with U.S. officials warning that Putin's forces may be preparing to invade. Putin, on the other hand, accuses NATO of causing the tense standoff by bolstering its military presence close to Russia's western flank. He has routinely accused the U.S. and its European allies of fomenting and supporting uprisings around the world, and particularly in the former Soviet Republics, which Moscow considers its own back yard. ""We view the recent events in a friendly country as an attempt to undermine the security and integrity of the state by force, using trained and organized armed formations, that is inspired from the outside,"" Russia's Foreign Ministry said Thursday of the decision to deploy forces to Kazakhstan. The statement offered no further information on the purported ""outside"" inspiration for the protests. Russian and U.S. diplomats are scheduled to meet next week in Geneva for negotiations aimed at easing the tension, following two calls between Putin and President Joe Biden. ""The Kremlin needs to divide attention between the two and manage strategic instability on two fronts,"" Carnegie Center analyst Alexander Baunov tweeted. ""Looks like Ukraine and NATO are no longer the only main focus of the future Russia-US talks, there is a new hot-button issue for negotiations with Biden. Baunov said the new crisis would make it ""harder for Putin to make a concerted effort on his key diplomatic front,"" which has been the standoff over Ukraine.",4,3.120240061696509,3.8073195685844414,-0.6870795068879323,17

It's the second call on the subject within a week for Mr. Biden, who spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. Mr. Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky's call came as the U.S. and Western allies prepared for a series of diplomatic meetings to try to de-escalate a crisis that Moscow said could rupture ties with Washington. ""President Biden made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement following the call. Psaki added that Biden underscored his commitment to the principle of ""nothing about you without you,"" the tenet that it won't negotiate policy that impacts Europe without its allies' input. Biden has spoken of hitting Russia with economy-jarring sanctions if it moves on Ukraine's territory, but he said last month that U.S. military action is not on the table. The Kremlin has demanded that any further expansion of NATO exclude Ukraine and other former Soviet countries. The Russians have also demanded that the military alliance remove offensive weaponry from countries in the region. ""If the obviously aggressive line of our Western colleagues continues, we will take adequate, retaliatory military-technical measures [and] react toughly to unfriendly steps,"" Putin told senior military officials during a meeting in remarks carried by Russian state TV last week. ""I want to emphasize that we have every right to do so."" The White House has dismissed Russia's demands on NATO as a non-starter. A key principle of the NATO alliance is that membership is open to any qualifying country. And no outsider has membership veto power. While there's little prospect that Ukraine would be invited into the alliance anytime soon, the U.S. and its allies won't rule it out. Zelensky said in a Twitter posting after Sunday's call that ""keeping peace in Europe, preventing further escalation, reforms, deoligarchization were discussed."" ""We appreciate the unwavering support,"" Zelensky said. Senior U.S. and Russian officials are scheduled to meet January 9-10 in Geneva to discuss the situation. Those talks are to be followed by meetings at the NATO-Russia Council, and at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Biden spoke with Putin for nearly an hour on Thursday. He told reporters the next day that he warned Putin that his economy would pay a ""heavy price"" if Russia, which has massed some 100,000 troops near the border, made further moves against Ukraine. ""I'm not going to negotiate here in public, but we made it clear that he cannot — I emphasize cannot — move on Ukraine,"" Biden said Friday. Biden said he told Putin it was important for the Russians to take steps before those meetings toward easing the crisis. Putin's foreign affairs adviser, in describing the presidents' conversation this past week, said Biden's pursuit of sanctions ""could lead to a complete rupture of relations between our countries and Russia-West relations will be severely damaged."" U.S. intelligence findings indicate Russia has made preparations for a potential invasion in early 2022. But White House officials say it remains unclear whether Putin has already made a decision to move forward with military action. Still, Biden said he remained hopeful for the upcoming talks. White House officials say they will consult closely with Western allies. ""I always expect if you negotiate you make progress, but we'll see,"" he said Friday. ""We'll see."" Past military incursions by Putin loom large as Mr. Biden weighs his next steps. In 2014, Russian troops marched into the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and seized the territory from Ukraine. Russia's annexation of Crimea was one of the darker moments for President Barack Obama on the international stage. The U.S.-Russia relationship was badly damaged near the end of President George W. Bush's administration after Russia's 2008 invasion of its neighbor Georgia after Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili ordered his troops into the breakaway region of South Ossetia. Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday he feared that Putin was intent on invading Ukraine and ""nothing other than a level of sanctions that Russia has never seen will deter him."" ""Russia needs to understand we are united in this,"" Schiff told ""Face the Nation"" on CBS. ""I also think that a powerful deterrent is the understanding that if they do invade, it is going to bring (NATO) closer to Russia, not push it farther away.",4,1.6939212117336675,1.3515651004637754,0.34235611126989207,26

On Thursday's call, the official said Mr. Biden will make clear he's prepared for a diplomatic path forward to reducing tensions, but also that ""we're prepared to respond"" if Russia advances with a further invasion of Ukraine, including with coordinated economic sanctions, ""further assistance"" to Ukraine and steps to ""reinforce NATO's force posture."" The two leaders held a video call earlier this month, with Mr. Biden telling Putin he had ""deep concerns"" about the troop buildup. The White House said Mr. Biden told Putin the U.S. would pursue ""strong economic and other measures"" in the event of an invasion. The White House said on Wednesday that Mr. Biden continues to coordinate with European allies for ""a common approach in response to Russia's military build-up on the border with Ukraine."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Blinken ""reiterated the United States' unwavering support for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity in the face of Russia's military buildup on Ukraine's borders."" The senior administration official said Wednesday there is no plan so far for Mr. Biden to speak to Zelenskyy after the Putin call like he did last time, but they are expected to speak soon. U.S. intelligence has warned that Russia could invade Ukraine as early as January, a U.S. official told CBS News earlier this month. Russia has built up an estimated 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border. Despite recent reports that the Russians have withdrawn 10,000 troops from the area, the senior administration official said the White House is ""greatly concerned"" about the still ""significant Russian troop presence"" along the border.

The Russian leader warned that if the U.S. and NATO do not halt what Moscow considers aggressive actions along the country's border with Ukraine, Russia would respond in a ""retaliatory military"" manner. ""If the obviously aggressive line of our Western colleagues continues, we will take adequate, retaliatory military-technical measures [and] react toughly to unfriendly steps,"" Putin told senior military officials during a meeting in remarks carried by Russian state TV. ""I want to emphasize that we have every right to do so."" Putin had previously spoken of his ""red lines"" on Ukraine — first and foremost his demand that the U.S. block Ukraine's bid to become a NATO member. He had accused the West of crossing his red lines already, but the stern warning in Tuesday's speech marked the first time he had personally warned of potential military action. ""They are doing whatever they want. But what they are doing now on the territory of Ukraine, or trying and planning to do, it is not a thousand kilometers from our national border, it is at our doorstep,"" Putin said, lamenting that Russia had ""nowhere to retreat."" Speaking to CBS ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated the Biden administration's support for Ukraine and warned that the U.S. and its allies were prepared to respond to any Russian incursion with harsh sanctions. The Biden administration has not ruled anything out in the standoff, but has not thus far said explicitly what level of assistance Ukraine could expect from Washington if Putin does attack. U.S. officials say they believe Putin has not yet made up his mind about whether to do that. ""We are very clear that Russia should not invade the sovereignty of Ukraine, that we must stand up — and we are standing up — for its territorial integrity,"" Harris told Brennan. ""We are working with our allies in that regard, and we've been very clear that we are prepared to issue sanctions like you've not seen before."" The vice president declined to say whether any new sanctions would target Putin directly, but noted that the administration and U.S. allies were in ""direct conversations"" with the Kremlin, and making their concerns and their own red lines well understood. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Dr. Karen Donfried, meanwhile, told reporters in a telephone briefing from Brussels on Tuesday morning that the U.S. was prepared to engage diplomatically through ""multiple channels,"" including bilateral engagement with Russia, through NATO talks with Moscow and through other regional blocs. Donfried said bilateral engagement between the U.S. and Russia was likely to take place ""in January,"" but offered no further detail on where or between whom. U.S. intelligence agencies raised the alarm weeks ago over Russia's massing of troops near its border with Ukraine, spurring fear in Western capitals of a potential repeat of Putin's 2014 invasion, which saw him annex the Crimean Peninsula away from the smaller neighboring nation. American officials say Russia has massed about 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, but Moscow rejects all claims that it's preparing for an attack as ""fake news."" Last week, Russia sent a formal, sweeping list of demands to the U.S., including that NATO cease its eastward expansion and reject any former Soviet country's bid for membership, including Ukraine. Many analysts said the proposals were essentially a non-starter, and the White House has made it clear that membership in the transatlantic defense alliance is for applying nations and current members to decide, not Russia. Following Putin's recent video call with President Biden, the countries appointed working teams to meet and seek a way to ease the tension. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that the relevant contacts were taking place and the U.S. had expressed ""readiness"" to engage in a dialogue with Russia. But Putin on Tuesday stressed that he would only accept ""long-term, legally binding guarantees"" from the U.S. ""You and I know well that even they, legal guarantees, cannot be trusted, because the U.S. easily withdraws from all international agreements it loses interest in for one reason or another while explaining it somehow or giving no explanations whatsoever,"" Putin said. ""Yet we need at least something, some legally binding agreements, not just verbal assurances. We know well the value of such assurances, words, and promises."" Speaking at the same meeting, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said the U.S. had ""deployed some 8,000 troops"" near Russian borders and, along with NATO allies, held frequent exercises within the vicinity of Russia using strategic bomber aircraft. He also shared plans for the Russian Armed Forces to grow by nearly 15,000 regular forces and hold two largescale exercises next year.",4,1.3342252245634796,1.3478554512196452,-0.013630226656165645,17

The international community's concerns about a possible invasion stem from Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea, which is viewed as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and not recognized by the international community. Putin opposes NATO expansion eastward into his sphere of influence, and he does not want Ukraine to obtain NATO membership. Ukraine has embraced Europe and very much wants to join the NATO alliance. There is currently a level 4 State Department ""do not travel"" travel advisory in place for Ukraine. The reason not to travel given in an earlier advisory was COVID-19, but the newest advisory, issued Monday, cites the military threat posed by Russia. ""U.S. citizens should be aware of reports that Russia is planning for significant military action against Ukraine,"" the advisory reads. This is the department's highest advisory, which warns of a ""greater likelihood of life-threatening risks"" and an environment that could make it extremely difficult for the U.S. government to aid any traveler in distress during an emergency. The Biden administration sanctioned Russia in April for a different reason – to retaliate for incursions including the SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign and Moscow's interference in the 2020 presidential election.",4,1.3474881807836716,1.3445925421254477,0.0028956386582239535,26
2021-12-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-troops-in-donbas-court-document-amid-concern-invasion/,"A Russian court document mentioned Russian troops ""stationed"" in eastern Ukraine. Moscow insists there are none.","Moscow — A Russian court's verdict in a bribery case last month appears to have inadvertently referenced the presence of Russian troops in the rebel-held Donbas area of Ukraine. A district court in Russia's Rostov region, on the Ukrainian border, disclosed that the manager of a company called Tekhnologiya LLC was responsible for stocking and selling food to Russian troops stationed in eastern Ukraine. The court sentenced the manager to five years in prison on charges of transferring about $13,500 from his boss to a local government official, to curry favor with authorities and avoid disruptions in the supply chain. ""These rations were intended to be sent to military units of the Russian Armed Forces stationed on the territory of the DNR and LNR,"" the court said in the verdict that was posted online, referring to the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk ""people's republics"" in eastern Ukraine. After the document started spreading on Russian media, the page was quickly taken down from the court's website. CBS News has reviewed an archived digital copy of the verdict. The document was first spotted by a Ukraine watcher who posts under the Twitter handle Necro_Mancer and reported by RFE/RL. Moscow has repeatedly denied the presence of Russian soldiers in Donbas, where rebels have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014. President Vladimir Putin's government insists Russia is not a part of the conflict. The U.S. and the European Union accuse Russia of supporting the separatists with troops, hardware and funding. The Kremlin on Thursday said the information contained in the document was ""a mistake."" ""This is probably the mistake of those who wrote this text. Because this is impossible,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. ""There have never been and there are no Russian Armed Forces present on the territory of the self-proclaimed republics."" The verdict from the court, however, included details on the complications of the seemingly clandestine logistics operation. The defendant had told the court that some drivers were paid relatively large sums of money — between $880 and $1,090 — for one delivery route due to ""the complexity and danger of the route."" The defendant said the drivers were ""risking their own lives at the border,"" had to remove their government license plates, hand over documents and proceed to unloading docks escorted by the receiving party. Food supplies to the people's republics were scheduled once every two weeks, the verdict said. One caravan consisted of more than 70 vehicles, capable of transporting 1,300 tons of cargo, including flour, canned food and fresh vegetables. One such shipment was estimated to have cost over $1 million. The conflict that broke out with Putin's unilateral annexation of Crimea away from Ukraine in 2014 has now claimed more than 13,000 lives. On Friday, the Ukrainian military said in a Facebook post that a soldier was killed in a new ""ceasefire violation by the Russian occupational forces."" The tense military standoff has escalated in recent weeks amid U.S. intelligence warnings that Russia is massing troops along its side of the Ukrainian border. Washington has been pushing its European allies to prepare a new round of tough economic sanctions against Moscow, and warning Putin against any invasion of Ukraine. U.S. officials previously told CBS News that Russia could have around 175,000 troops deployed to the border area by early next year, making an assault possible as early as January. The State Department has said, however, that the U.S. doesn't yet know whether Putin has made a decision to attack. The Kremlin has consistently denied any plans to invade Ukraine and Putin has repeatedly called NATO's eastward expansion a threat to Russia. He has demanded that his ""red lines"" when it comes to Ukraine be respected — most importantly that the U.S. shut Kyiv's door to NATO membership. U.S. President Joe Biden rebutted the accusations of NATO aggression and said it wasn't up to Moscow whether a country is admitted to the alliance. Last week, the two leaders held a two-hour video summit to discuss the crisis. They agreed to deploy representatives to working groups to start looking for ways to ease the tension. Earlier this week, Putin demanded ""immediate"" high-level talks to address Moscow's security concerns. Russian diplomats have sent the U.S. a list of proposals for mutual security guarantees, passing it to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried, who was in Moscow after holding talks in Kyiv. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Friday that Russia was no longer willing to let the current situation stand, and he called on the West to engage immediately in serious talks, without preconditions, to try to mend ties. ""We do not use the language of ultimatums with anyone, we approach our own safety and the safety of others very responsibly. The question here is not whether we have put forward an ultimatum, it is not one,"" insisted Ryabkov, adding: ""But the matter is that the seriousness of our warning should not be underestimated."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Air Force One on Friday that the U.S. had seen Russia's proposals, but that there would be ""no talks on European security without our European allies and partners.""",4,2.759910363318898,1.8578459296144976,0.9020644337044006,7

Congressmen Ruben Gallego, Michael Waltz and Seth Moulton — all military veterans serving on the committee — told reporters that proactive measures, including economic sanctions and weapons procurement, were key to deterring Russia from launching a military incursion. ""This is about speed,"" Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat, said at a virtual news conference Tuesday. ""[Russian President Vladimir] Putin is moving very quickly…It's now up to the administration to respond quickly, and that's exactly what we, as legislators, are pushing them to do."" ""We need to be more focused on preventing an invasion than just responding to one,"" he said. ""We need to help Ukraine 'porcupine' themselves and raise the cost now,"" said Waltz, a Republican from Florida. ""We're talking about helping the capability, the will of our Ukrainian allies, who made it clear to us they intend to fight if Putin does the worst and conducts a partial or full-scale invasion."" ""The more that we can show that there will be resistance, the less likely they'll want to get bogged down in a war in Ukraine,"" Gallego, a Democrat, said in a separate interview Tuesday with CBS News. ""I think Putin understands at least one thing: if he gets into war in Ukraine and doesn't win it, it is part of an existential threat to his to his ability to hold power."" Gallego, who chairs the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations, also said assessments of Russia's buildup he had reviewed from both the U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon suggested all the lights were ""blinking red."" Over the past two months, Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine, prompting fears of an invasion as early as January, according to U.S. intelligence assessments. U.S. officials have also accused Moscow of mounting an aggressive information operation to destabilize Ukraine politically, undermine its social cohesion and pin blame for any escalation on Kyiv and NATO. The Pentagon's press secretary, John Kirby, said Tuesday there had been no indication that Russia had begun moving its troops away from the Ukrainian border, despite direct talks between Presidents Biden and Putin last week. The Biden administration has prioritized diplomatic engagement since the buildup began. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the administration was consulting ""closely"" with European allies on the potential launch of security discussions with Russia. Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried this week traveled to Kyiv and Moscow for continued talks. ""Our objective continues to be to keep this on a diplomatic path and for that to lead to de-escalation,"" Psaki said. In a press conference in Brussels, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance continued to ""stand ready to engage with Russia."" Gallego, Moulton and Waltz warned on Tuesday that protracted diplomatic efforts risked emboldening Moscow. Putin, they said, had positioned himself to pursue multiple options, from continued political destabilization designed to undermine the Ukrainian government to cutting off electricity, gas or coal imports, to a full-scale invasion. ""If Putin invades I want him to know that he'll have trouble buying a soda from a vending machine in the next five minutes, not that NATO will convene a conference to debate what to do next over the ensuing several weeks,"" Moulton said. ""The next round of lethal aid is literally sitting on [President Biden's] desk,"" Waltz said. ""The Ukrainians are practically begging for it."" ""This is a policy issue, and we hope to see some important shifts in policy,"" he said.",4,2.0284251951338033,3.096907183404452,-1.0684819882706487,26
2021-12-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-china-ukraine-putin-xi-call-nato-tension/,"As Russia threatens to ""respond militarily"" in Ukraine standoff, Putin has a friendly video call with China's Xi","Moscow — After a week of tough phone calls with European leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin turned to a friendlier ear on Wednesday to hold a video meeting with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping. With tension high and still mounting between the West and both of their countries, Putin and Xi praised strengthening Russia-China ties, with the Russian leader calling them ""a true example of interstate cooperation in the 21st century."" ""A new model of cooperation has been formed between our countries, based, among other things, on the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and respect for each other's interests, and the determination to turn the common border into a belt of eternal peace and good-neighborliness,"" Putin declared in televised remarks after the virtual meeting. Xi highlighted his closeness with Putin by noting that it was the 37th direct discussion held between the two leaders since 2013. Putin also said he planned to meet Xi in person in Beijing in February and take part in the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics, which the U.S. and some of its allies are diplomatically boycotting. ""I would like to note that we have always supported each other on issues of international sports cooperation, including in rejecting any attempts to politicize sport and the Olympic movement,"" Putin said in reference to the U.S. decision not to send government officials to the Games. Amid soaring tension between Moscow and Washington over Russia's military buildup along the Ukrainian border, Putin has had a series of calls over the last week with European leaders to demand guarantees that NATO will not seek to expand further eastward, toward Russia's border. Putin's government has made it clear that Ukraine joining the transatlantic defense alliance would be a ""red line"" for the Kremlin. Ukraine, a U.S. and European Union ally, is actively seeking NATO membership, and the Biden administration has refused to rule it out, insisting it is a matter for Ukraine's sovereign government and NATO members to decide. U.S. officials, meanwhile, have rung alarm bells for weeks over Russia's massing of tens of thousands of troops along its border with Ukraine. The White House has been warning European allies that Moscow could even launch another invasion of Ukraine this winter. The Kremlin insists it has no nefarious intentions and the troops deployed on Russia's own soil pose no threat to Ukraine. Putin and other officials routinely accuse NATO and the West of being the aggressor, by beefing up troop presence on the Ukrainian side and in other eastern European countries. The U.S. and the EU have warned Russia that any military action against Ukraine would be met with a coordinated barrage of economic sanctions. On Tuesday, in a phone call with the Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, whose country has often served as neutral ground for contacts between Moscow and Western capitals, Putin demanded ""immediate"" security talks with NATO. ""Vladimir Putin again stressed the importance of immediately starting talks with the United States and NATO,"" the Kremlin said in a readout. ""The goal of the talks would be to draft international legal security guarantees for Russia, ruling out NATO's further movement eastward and the deployment of weapons systems threatening Russia in Ukraine and other adjacent states."" Putin reiterated the same demands in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, as the Russian military said it was monitoring a French warship in the Black Sea. Putin's meeting with Xi came a day after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov warned that Moscow could resort to militarily action if the ongoing discussions with European leaders fail to resolve the standoff over Ukraine and NATO. ""The lack of progress towards a political-diplomatic solution to this problem will lead to the fact that we will respond militarily,"" Ryabkov told the state-run news agency RIA Novosti.",4,1.517587262125692,2.174637341179075,-0.6570500790533829,7

The two leaders held a video call for two hours on Tuesday, after U.S. intelligence officials warned of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine as soon as January. ""President Biden voiced the deep concerns of the United States and our European Allies about Russia's escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine and made clear that the U.S. and our Allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation,"" the White House summary of the call said. ""President Biden reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy."" The statement said the two leaders tasked their teams to ""follow up, and the U.S. will do so in close coordination with allies and partners."" Mr. Biden and Putin also discussed ""the U.S.-Russia dialogue on Strategic Stability, a separate dialogue on ransomware, as well as joint work on regional issues such as Iran."" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Tuesday afternoon the U.S. and allies would implement economic sanctions and provide material support for NATO allies in Eastern Europe if Russia further invades Ukraine. Sullivan described the meeting as a ""useful"" one, full of back-and-forth discussion. Sullivan declined to go into details about Russia's side of the discussion. Tens of thousands of Russian troops have amassed at the Ukraine border, months after thousands of troops assembled at the border in the spring. But unlike last spring's buildup, which was regarded as a show of force, U.S. intelligence officials are warning that this one could be in preparation for an actual incursion into the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine. After the virtual meeting between the two leaders got underway, Russian state television showed footage of Putin greeting Mr. Biden. ""Good to see you again,"" Mr. Biden said. ""We didn't get to see one another at the G-20. I hope next time we meet we do it in person."" The White House released a photo of Mr. Biden in the Situation Room, where he was joined by Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and two other aides. On a call with reporters Monday, a senior administration official didn't go into specifics about what Mr. Biden planned to tell Putin the U.S. military will or won't do in the event of an incursion. The official did say that in the event of a Russian military invasion, the U.S. will provide reassurance to allies. ""I don't want to use a public press call to talk about the particular sensitive challenges that President Biden will lay out for president Putin, but I would say that the United States is not seeking to end up in a circumstance in which the focus of our countermeasures is the direct use of American military force as opposed to a combination of support for Ukrainian military, strong economic countermeasures, and a substantial increase in support and capability to our NATO allies to ensure that they remain safe,"" the official said. Russia has denied any buildup and has accused Ukraine of its own troop buildup, according to BBC News. Mr. Biden planned to speak to key European allies later Monday, and with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, Sullivan said. Mr. Biden said Friday that he has been ""aware of Russia's actions for a long time."" Putin said last week that he had new ""red lines"" — Washington and its allies must not deploy missiles in Ukraine capable of hitting Moscow. He is also fiercely opposed to Ukraine's bid for NATO membership, and has demanded guarantees that the transatlantic military alliance will not push its geopolitical boundaries further east, toward Russian soil. Mr. Biden said Friday that he doesn't ""accept anyone's red lines."" A possible Russian invasion of Ukraine could involve as many as 175,000 troops, a U.S. official confirmed last week to CBS News. The plans involve extensive movement of 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated 175,000 personnel, along with armor, artillery and equipment, according to an administration official. Roughly 70,000 Russian troops are currently deployed opposite Ukraine, although they lack the support units needed to launch an invasion. That support would come from reservists. Blinken said Friday that Putin's actions on the border are ""very, very concerning"" not just to the U.S. but to European leaders as well. Blinken said there would be ""high-impact economic consequences"" if Putin stages an incursion into Ukraine. ""Well, we don't know President Putin's intent,"" Blinken said. ""We don't know if he's made a decision to take renewed aggressive action against Ukraine."" In 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and amassed troops along the border. Blinken said last month that ""our concern is that Russia may make the serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014 when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory, and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked.""

2021-12-08,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-news-what-you-need-to-know/,Russia is amassing troops near the Ukrainian border: What you need to know,"Russia has built up roughly 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine, prompting fears of an attack in early 2022. U.S. intelligence is warning that Russia could invade Ukraine as early as January, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News last week. It's not yet clear if Russia actually plans to invade — but the buildup of forces has sparked international concern. At a virtual summit on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Biden reiterated the U.S.' commitment to Ukrainian independence and threatened severe economic sanctions if Russia invades. Here's what you need to know about the conflict. There are an estimated 100,000 Russian forces massing near the Ukrainian border. Those forces currently lack the support units needed to sustain an invasion, but a U.S. official told CBS News that Russia has embarked on a sudden and rapid program to establish a ready reserve of the support it would need. U.S. officials have also accused Moscow of mounting an aggressive information operation to destabilize Ukraine politically, undermine its social cohesion and pin blame for any escalation on Kyiv and NATO. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday the administration does not believe Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a decision on whether to invade Ukraine, but said Mr. Biden has made clear the repercussions if he does. The international community is concerned because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014. In the freezing months of February and March, Russia annexed Crimea, a part of Ukraine that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union. The annexation is not recognized by the international community. Since the 2014 annexation, there has been a proxy war in the Donbas region of Ukraine between Russian-backed forces and the Ukrainian government. A peace deal in 2015 largely ended the major battles, but the fighting continues. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the Ukrainian government. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks often of the ethnic ties between Russia and Ukraine and warns against NATO expanding eastward into what he considers his sphere of influence. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union before declaring its independence in 1991. Putin also argues that assistance from the West to Ukraine poses threats to Russia's border. But the Kremlin says Russia has no intentions of invading Ukraine and that its troop movements are defensive in nature. The Ukrainian people have expressed growing support for Western institutions, including membership in NATO. While pro-Russian sentiment does exist in some eastern parts of the country, Ukrainians ousted a pro-Russia president in 2014 and have consistently elected pro-Western politicians since. Russian forces started building up near the Ukrainian border this spring, prompting the U.S. government to call on Russia to explain the presence of the troops. Mr. Biden called Putin to express his concern. The Russians started withdrawing at the end of April, and said the movements had been part of a large-scale military exercise. Mr. Biden and Putin then had a summit in Geneva in June where Mr. Biden said he confirmed the U.S.'s commitment to Ukraine's independence. The latest build-up, which started in October, has prompted more calls from U.S. officials for Russia to explain its intentions. This week, Mr. Biden and Putin held a two-hour virtual meeting largely devoted to discussing Ukraine. According to a White House readout, Mr. Biden reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation. Mr. Biden on Wednesday said sending U.S. troops to act unilaterally is not on the table. However, the president has said the U.S. and European allies would increase military support to Ukraine and impose severe economic sanctions, including cutting Russia off from the international finance system and suspending the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, if Russia invades. The U.S. has been training and advising Ukrainian forces since 2015, and has also provided over $2.5 billion in security assistance since 2014. The support includes items like air surveillance radars, armed patrol boats, and Javelin anti-tank systems, according to the Department of Defense. U.S. officials say Russia could launch an incursion at any time, but its forces do not yet have the logistical units in place to sustain an operation for more than a couple weeks. The U.S. assessment is that Russia would wait for the ground to freeze before sending tanks and other tracked vehicles into Ukraine. CIA Director William Burns said Monday that Putin may also be waiting for a moment when other European countries are ""distracted"" with their own affairs, citing the new incoming government in Germany and France's presidential elections next year. But for now, it is not clear if Putin wants to actually mount an invasion or is using the threat of an invasion to win concessions from the West.",4,1.6549686785181739,1.7758916257030577,-0.12092294718488383,17

The plans involve extensive movement of 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated 175,000 personnel, along with armor, artillery and equipment, according to an administration official. Roughly 70,000 Russian troops are currently deployed opposite Ukraine, although they lack the support units needed to launch an invasion. That support would come from reservists. According to the administration official, Russia has embarked on a sudden and rapid program to establish a ready reserve of contract reservists — something that was not seen back in the spring during a rapid Russian military buildup near Ukraine's borders. A National Security Council spokesperson said the Biden administration has been consistent in its message to Russia, which is that the United States does not seek conflict, and that diplomacy and de-escalation should be used to avert a crisis. ""We are deeply concerned by evidence that Russia is stepping up its planning for significant military action against Ukraine,"" the spokesperson told CBS News. The U.S. and other officials have been sounding the alarm in recent weeks over Russian troops massing, concerned that an offensive or an escalation of a seven-year-long conflict in the volatile eastern region of Donbas could be on the horizon. Russian officials, however, have said reports of a military buildup are baseless and in turn accused NATO of building more of a foothold in what Russia considers its own backyard. The country's top diplomat attacked the alliance this week for deploying a significant amount of military hardware near Russia's borders and said Moscow could respond to security threats from Western countries and Ukraine if necessary. ""The fact that we are being accused of conducting military exercises on our sovereign territory by the countries that are bringing troops and military equipment to our borders in huge quantities from overseas and the fact that the United States has surrounded us from all sides with their military bases is something every schoolkid knows,"" Russia's Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday. ""And yet this hysteria is constantly being whipped up,"" he said. The U.S., however, has information indicating that Russian media outlets and others have been increasing content disparaging Ukraine and NATO, partly to blame a possible Russian military escalation on Ukraine, according to the administration official. There are also indications that Russian officials have proposed emphasizing a narrative that Ukrainian leaders were installed by the West, harbor hatred for the ""Russian world"" and were acting against the Ukrainian people's interest.

2021-12-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/britain-mi6-boss-says-china-is-the-single-greatest-priority-for-mi6/,"British spy chief on why China is the ""single greatest priority"" for MI6, and what's needed to respond","London — The head of Britain's MI6 spy agency, akin to the CIA in the U.S., said in his first public speech and live interview this week that China was the ""single greatest priority"" for U.K. intelligence services. Richard Moore listed Russia, Iran, and foreign terrorism as other top security concerns. Moore is the only publicly identified member of MI6. He said he was issuing a rare public briefing on the secretive spy agency's priorities because, given rapidly developing technology around the world, ""to stay secret, we are going to have to become more open."" He said the intelligence agency would need to shift from keeping everything in-house, to working with private technology companies if it was to compete with the rapid advances of other nations. ""We are living through an era of dramatic change in the security landscape,"" Moore said. ""We face adversaries who are feeling emboldened, encounter fewer constraints and are able to draw on greater resources than in the past."" Moore told CBS News' partner network BBC News that while it was important to work with China to tackle pressing global issues like climate change and trade, ""it's also the case that China is controlled by an authoritarian regime. They don't share our values and often their interests clash with ours."" In a speech delivered to a security research group, he said ""the tectonic plates are shifting as China's power, and its willingness to assert it, grows."" China is rapidly expanding its technical capabilities, including in artificial intelligence, Moore said. If the U.K. wants to keep up, it needs to be able to compete and defend itself in digital spaces. ""The huge volumes of data now available across the globe, combined with ever increasing computer power and advances in data science, will mean the integration of artificial intelligence, AI, into almost every aspect of our daily lives. Others would speak to you about the benefits associated with these new discoveries, and they are myriad. But I am paid to look at the threat side of the ledger."" For example, China's surveillance state is targeting the minority ethnic Uighur population in the Xinxang region and has detained nearly 1 million people there, carrying out wide scale human rights violations in a repressive crackdown. ""Worryingly, these technologies of control and surveillance are increasingly being exported to other governments by China, expanding the web of authoritarian control around the planet,"" he said. In addition to ""data traps,"" China has also been increasing its international influence by setting ""debt traps,"" Moore said. In the last 10 years, China has become the largest non-commercial lender in the world, with its state-owned banks extending more credit to developing nations than the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, according to Bloomberg. ""If you take on loans and then you find it difficult to repay them, then, you know, we've seen some examples of this where the Chinese have then been able to acquire significant ports… which have the potential to become naval facilities,"" Moore told the BBC. ""We want other countries to be cleareyed about the debt traps, data exposure and vulnerability to political coercion that arise from dependency on relationships where there is no recourse to an independent judiciary or free press,"" he said in his speech. Moore also said that Beijing's increasing interest in exerting dominion over democratically governed Taiwan — by force if necessary — was a threat to global security. ""Beijing believes its own propaganda about Western frailties and underestimates Washington's resolve,"" he said. ""The risk of Chinese miscalculation through overconfidence is real."" Moore said that Russia continues to pose an ""acute threat"" to the U.K., launching cyber attacks, interfering in the democratic process in other countries, and attempting state-sponsored killings, like the 2018 poisoning of Sergei Skripal in England. He said Britain and its allies must stand up to Russia to deter such activity. ""No country in Europe or beyond should be seduced into thinking that unbalanced concessions to Russia bring better behavior,"" Moore said, noting Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its current troop buildup along the border with Ukraine, which the U.S. and NATO are treating as a threat. ""Iranian leadership has embraced an explicit doctrine of conflict with both Israel and the West,"" Moore said. ""Indeed, we deeply regret that a country with an almost unparalleled depth of history and culture, such as Iran, has been the source of instability across the region and beyond for over 40 years."" In addition to interference by backing extremist groups in countries like Syria, Iran's nuclear program is also a focus for MI6, Moore said. International negotiations on its program resumed this week in Vienna. ""There are many parallels with the challenge that Russia poses, and it is no coincidence that the two countries have made common cause in Syria,"" Moor said. ""We will continue to work to contain the threat posed by Iran, to the U.K. directly and to our allies in the region. That includes contesting Iran's development of nuclear technology, which has no conceivable civilian use."" The threat of terrorism has also changed as the world becomes more digital, with many terrorists and terrorist networks operating online. ""There is no longer such a thing as an analog intelligence operation in this digital world. Our intelligence targets have online lives. Our officers need to operate invisibly to our adversaries, and we need to be able to run our agent and technical operations in an environment in which 'made in China' surveillance technology is found around the world,"" Moore said. He said that it would become easier for those looking to carry out an attack to conceal their plans, and that sadly, some lone wolf attacks may well get through. The British spy chief also said the Taliban's victory in Afghanistan would mean an increased risk of international terrorist attacks. ""There is no doubt about the morale boost the Taliban victory in Afghanistan has given to the extremist movement globally, as well as its potential emboldening effect on countries such as Russia, China and Iran,"" he said. ""I won't soft-soap it: The threat we face will likely grow. Now we have left Afghanistan, al Qaeda and Daesh [ISIS] will seek to increase their foothold and to rebuild their ability to strike Western targets."" Moore said that to counter all these threats, MI6 would have to open itself up to working with tech experts in a way it has never done before. ""We can't match the scale and resources of the global tech industry, so we shouldn't try,"" he said. ""We are opening up our mission problems to those with talent in organizations that wouldn't normally work with national security. Unlike 'Q' in the Bond movies, we cannot do it all in-house.""",20,3.894945592660119,3.537990886059197,0.3569547066009222,3
2021-11-30,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-aggression-us-serious-consequences/,"U.S. warns renewed Russian aggression in Ukraine will trigger ""serious consequences""","Any renewed Russian aggression in Ukraine would trigger ""serious consequences,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday during a visit to Latvia, where NATO foreign ministers assembled to discuss the recent buildup of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border. In recent weeks, the U.S. and other officials have been sounding the alarm over Russia amassing troops near its border with Ukraine, concerned that an offensive or an escalation of a seven-year-long conflict in the volatile eastern region of Donbas could be on the horizon. Blinken called the Russian troop movements ""unusual"" and added any escalatory actions by Russia would be of ""great concern"" to the United States. Russian officials said the reports of a military buildup are baseless and in turn accused NATO of building more of a foothold in what Russia considers its own backyard. The country's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, attacked the alliance for deploying a significant amount of military hardware near Russia's borders and said Moscow could respond to security threats from Western countries and Ukraine if necessary. ""The fact that we are being accused of conducting military exercises on our sovereign territory by the countries that are bringing troops and military equipment to our borders in huge quantities from overseas and the fact that the United States has surrounded us from all sides with their military bases is something every schoolkid knows,"" Lavrov said Tuesday. ""And yet this hysteria is constantly being whipped up,"" he added, referring to concerns voiced by Western leaders about military aggression toward Ukraine. Newly appointed Ukrainian defense minister Alexey Reznikov suggested that the current buildup is ""most likely"" connected to a possible upcoming virtual meeting between President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which the Kremlin said is in the works and may happen before the end of the year. On Friday, Mr. Biden told reporters he expected to talk to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ""in all probability."" Zelenskyy said during a press conference last weekend, ""I think we have been in the state of war for the past eight years. But when it comes to a full-fledged [offensive] … I think today some media have been fearmongering on that matter."" Ukraine's head of military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said more than 90,000 Russian troops are deployed in the vicinity of Ukraine, a smaller number compared to similar tensions last spring. Analysts point out there is little for the Kremlin to gain if an all-out war breaks out, which would sever already fraying ties with the international community. The escalation is largely seen as a signal that Putin strives to redraw ""red lines"" when it comes to Ukraine and reshuffle what Russia sees as an outdated European security system. ""NATO's expansion has shaped the politico-military landscape in which we live today,"" Fedor Lukyanov, chairman of Russia's Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, wrote in an op-ed. ""Maintaining such a perspective is fraught with aggravation, and parting with it requires… revision and establishment of a new system of 'red lines.'"" On Tuesday, Putin confirmed he views an expansion of NATO military infrastructure in Ukraine as a line he hopes would not be crossed. ""First and foremost, this is about creating threats for us, that may come from this territory… if there will be missile strike systems in Ukraine, able to reach Moscow within 7-10 minutes, or five minutes if those would be hypersonic missiles, what are we supposed to do?"" Putin said, speaking at an investment forum in Moscow. ""We will have to create something similar against those who threaten us in such a way,"" Putin said.",4,1.3984055556500077,1.0450555822880552,0.3533499733619525,17
2021-11-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-chief-russia-ukraine-military-buildup/,NATO chief warns Russia of 'costs' if it moves on Ukraine,"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned Russia Friday that any attempt to invade Ukraine would have costs, as concern mounts about a Russian military buildup near its former Soviet neighbor's borders. Ukraine says Moscow kept about 90,000 troops near their common border following massive war games in western Russia earlier this year. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said units of the Russian 41st army remain near Yelnya, about 260 kilometers (160 miles) north of the border. Moscow denies that it's planning any invasion and refuses to provide details about troop movements on its own territory. ""If Russia uses force against Ukraine that will have costs, that would have consequences,"" Stoltenberg said, ahead of a meeting of the 30-nation military organization's foreign ministers in Latvia November 30-December 1, where Russia's activities will be high on the agenda. He did not say what those costs would be. ""This is the second time this year that Russia has amassed a large and unusual concentration of forces in the region,"" Stoltenberg told reporters. He said it includes tanks, artillery, armored units, drones, and electronic warfare systems, as well as combat-ready troops. ""This military buildup is unprovoked and unexplained. It raises tensions and it risks miscalculations,"" Stoltenberg said. He conceded that ""there is no certainty about the intentions of Russia"" but said that ""this is a military buildup by a country that has invaded Ukraine before."" Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 after the country's Moscow-friendly president was driven from power by mass protests. Weeks later, Russia threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency that broke out in Ukraine's east. Ukraine and the West accused Russia of sending its troops and weapons to back the rebels. Moscow denied that, saying that Russians who joined the separatists were volunteers. More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting that devastated Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland known as Donbas. A 2015 peace agreement brokered by France and Germany helped end large-scale battles, but efforts to reach a political settlement have failed and sporadic skirmishes have continued along the tense line of contact. NATO would not be able to provide Ukraine with any substantial military support in time to make a difference against Russian forces, so economic measures like Western sanctions are more likely to be used to inflict a financial cost on Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday alleged that his country's intelligence service has uncovered plans for a Russia-backed coup d'etat in Ukraine next week, something which the Russian government denied. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Friday spoke with the head of the Presidential Administration in Ukraine, Andriy Yermak. The two discussed their shared concerns about ongoing Russian military activities near Ukraine's border and agreed that all sides should pursue diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions, National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said in a statement. ""Mr. Sullivan underscored the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the statement read.",4,1.433407609966232,3.894820087477517,-2.461412477511285,17
2021-11-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-officials-warn-possible-russian-military-incursion-into-ukraine/,U.S. officials warn of possible Russian military incursion into Ukraine,"U.S. intelligence officials are warning European allies of a potential Russian military incursion into Ukraine, with the likelihood of one increasing as the weather gets colder. An incursion is weather-dependent, but could happen in a matter of weeks, barring intervention from the West, U.S. officials briefed on the matter told CBS News. Tens of thousands of Russian troops have amassed at the Ukraine border -- months after thousands of troops assembled at the border in the spring. But unlike last spring's buildup, which was regarded as a show of force, U.S. intelligence officials are warning that this one could be in preparation for an actual incursion into the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday the alliance was closely monitoring a ""large and unusual concentration of Russian forces"" near Ukraine's border. ""It is urgent that Russia shows transparency about this military build-up, de-escalates and reduces tensions,"" Stoltenberg said following a meeting with outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both American and British intelligence has been shared with European stakeholders. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley spoke with General Valery Zaluzhny, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, on Friday. They discussed the security situation in Eastern Europe including Russia's ""concerning activity in the area,"" Joint Staff Spokesperson Col. Dave Butler said in a media release. ""The Chairman stressed the need for continued consultation amongst regional allies and partners, and reaffirmed U.S. support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" it said. The release noted Ukraine is a key NATO partner with a critical role in maintaining stability in Europe. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a joint press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that the U.S. does not ""have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook."" ""[O]ur concern is that Russia may make the serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014 when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory, and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" Blinken said. On Saturday, he said the U.S. has ""real concerns"" about Russia's activities at the Ukrainian border. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines met with top NATO leadership and Polish government officials while she was overseas this week. She briefed NATO ambassadors about U.S. intelligence and a possible Russian intervention in Ukraine, The New York Times reports. Haines' meetings followed a series of engagements in Moscow by a U.S. delegation led by CIA Director Bill Burns, who traveled at President Biden's request earlier this month to warn Russia against taking action in Ukraine. Some of Burns' meetings were highly charged and contentious, which was not unexpected, according to officials familiar with them. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez from New Jersey, introduced an amendment to the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act late Thursday night that would trigger possible sanctions and visa bans against top Russian officials should Russia invade Ukraine. Other targets of the sanctions would include the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, a Kremlin-backed pipeline that would bypass Ukraine and deliver Russian gas directly to Europe. The sanctions could also hit major financial institutions, sovereign debt transactions and more. The amendment calls on President Biden to make a determination that the hostilities — defined as ""escalatory military or other offensive operations"" — warrant sanctions. U.S. concerns about a possible incursion into Ukraine come amid a crisis nearby, at the Poland-Belarus border. Officials have not yet determined whether there is any connection between Russia and the situation at that border, where thousands of desperate migrants funneled into Belarus from Iraq, Syria and Yemen had gathered in frigid conditions trying to get into Poland -- EU soil. On Friday, in a considerable de-escalation of tensions, Belarusian authorities cleared the camps where migrants had lived for weeks. But Polish officials said migrants had instead been shuttled elsewhere, in smaller groups, at multiple other border crossings. ""We have to prepare for the fact that this problem will continue for months. I have no doubt that that will be the case,"" Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said in a radio interview on Saturday.",4,1.503620365012753,3.4147331973665653,-1.9111128323538122,17
2021-11-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cyber-security-cybersecurity-ransomware-hacking-businesses-worry-holidays/,"Businesses worried about cyberattacks during the holidays, report finds","Washington — After a year of headline-grabbing ransomware attacks, businesses say they're worried about the possibility they'll face cyber intrusions this holiday season, a time when many of their cybersecurity operations rely on skeleton staffing. Boston-based cybersecurity firm Cybereason commissioned a survey of 1,206 cybersecurity professionals at organizations that experienced a ransomware attack during a holiday or weekend within the last year. A whopping 89% of the respondents from the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, and UAE indicated that they were concerned about a repeat cyber intrusion ahead of the holiday season. However, 36% said they had no ""specific contingency plan in place to mount a response."" ""The question becomes, at what point does this concern from cyber professionals translate into an action plan?"" Cybereason CEO Lior Div told CBS News. ""Do organizations have the right tools, processes and people in place to deal with an attack specifically in the upcoming holiday season? Hackers love to hack when they know we're distracted and not ready to respond."" The study revealed that organizations in the healthcare (65%) and manufacturing (67%) sectors — two of the biggest targets for ransomware attacks — were among the industries least likely to have developed contingency plans. Cybercriminals have expanded hacking operations to repeatedly target the healthcare industry amid the coronavirus pandemic, leading to worsened health outcomes and excess deaths at hospitals. Ahead of Labor Day weekend, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published a joint advisory warning of an ""increase in highly impactful ransomware attacks occurring on holidays and weekends — when offices are normally closed — in the United States,"" following a string of high-profile cyber incidents over long weekends. Days later, Howard University in Washington, D.C. was forced to cancel classes for more than a week after malicious actors held its network hostage. The July 4 holiday weekend saw one of the single largest ransomware attacks to date, when an affiliate of the ""REvil"" cyber gang targeted software company Kaseya just six weeks after the Russian-linked cyber criminals sabotaged meat processor JBS over Memorial Day weekend, extorting the company for an $11 million ransom. Colonial Pipeline paid a $4.4 million in ransom to the DarkSide group after being forced to shut down its operations during Mother's Day weekend, though the FBI later recovered $2.3 million of the ransom from the Russia-based hacking group. The new report by Cybereason revealed the human cost of such attacks, with 86% of respondents missing holidays or weekend activities with family and friends to return to work in the wake of a cyber incident. Nearly three-quarters surveyed admitted they were intoxicated while responding to a ransomware attack on the weekend or during a holiday, ""a risk factor for organizations that may not have been accounted for by incident response and business continuity plans,"" according to the report. And the vulnerability of these organizations is further exacerbated by holes in the workforce. In the United States, there are nearly 500,000 vacancies for cybersecurity jobs, according to Cyber Seek — a tech job-tracking database from the U.S. Commerce Department — and the trade group CompTIA. Ransomware payments reached over $400 million in 2020, the FBI reported. And this year, the average ransom payment is up more than 500% over 2020, amounting to $5.3 million, according to Cybereason. In June, President Biden demanded that Russian President Vladimir Putin put an end to cybercriminal operations using Russia as a safe harbor. But attacks have persisted despite ""too soon to tell"" and diplomatic efforts aimed at curtailing Russia-linked ransomware operations. ""From the beginning of this year, we've seen a massive push in cyber intrusions, specifically originating from the ransomware cartel in Russia, starting all the way from Colonial Pipeline to the JBS hack,"" Div told CBS News. ""We thought that after President Biden met with President Putin, we'd see a decrease in those types of attacks. But actually, what we see is a steady stream of these types of hacks. The ransomware cartel did not stop for even a single moment."" In early November, the country's top military cyber officer, Army General Paul Nakasone, said it was ""too soon to tell"" if the Kremlin had facilitated the international hunt for cybercriminals after the United States handed over names of wanted suspects. ""From an FBI perspective, we have not seen a decrease in ransomware attacks in the past couple of months originating from Russia,"" Bryan Vorndran, assistant director of the FBI's cyber division, told Congress on Tuesday. Tiny cybersecurity mistakes by companies or organizations can cause massive damage. A congressional investigation into three major ransomware events in 2021 noted that ""small lapses led to major breaches."" The report, released on Tuesday by the House Oversight Committee, indicated that ""Ransomware attackers took advantage of relatively minor security lapses, such as a single user account controlled by a weak password, to launch enormously costly attacks."" ""Even large organizations with seemingly robust security systems fell victim to simple initial attacks,"" the report continued, ""highlighting the need to increase security education and take other security measures prior to an attack."" In its own report, Cybereason offered companies and organizations advice aimed at reducing risk this holiday season. ""Practicing good security hygiene,"" ""lock down critical accounts for the holidays or weekend,"" and ""assure key players can be reached at any time of day,"" were among the laundry list of precautions suggested. ""Cyber defenders are heroes,"" Div added. ""We need to ensure that companies and organizations are providing them with the right tools and support to do their job right.""",20,6.044327074698942,3.739744201859199,2.304582872839743,2

The bloc voiced its concern after Washington demanded an explanation from Moscow about the troop movements, and amid mounting tension between the U.S. and Europe in the west, and Russia and its small ally Belarus in the east. ""We continue to watch the situation and the information we gathered so far is rather worrying,"" EU foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano told journalists. He said the 27-nation bloc was monitoring the situation with partners including the United States and Britain and ""we are open to look at further steps as necessary."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday warned Russia against making another ""serious mistake"" on Ukraine, as Washington sought clarity about Russian troop movements near the border. Welcoming Ukraine's foreign minister to Washington, Blinken said the U.S. was ""concerned with reports of the unusual Russian activity near Ukraine."" ""We don't have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook,"" Blinken told a joint news conference. ""Our concern is that Russia may make the serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Russian movements were ""unusual in its size and scope,"" and added that it was ""not exactly clear what the Russian intentions are."" Ukraine has been ensnared in a deadly war with Moscow-backed separatists in its east since 2014 when Russia seized the Crimean peninsula. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen discussed the situation around Ukraine with U.S. President Joe Biden during a visit to Washington this week. ""The EU and the U.S. fully support the territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" von der Leyen tweeted after the meeting. ""We are fully behind them in their efforts to modernize their economy and build up resilience."" An official at U.S.-led NATO said the alliance was ""vigilant and routinely monitors Russian force movements. It's important to ensure transparency and avoid any miscalculation."" Russia downplayed the concerns as it did the last time it massed forces along Ukraine's border, with a Kremlin spokesman dismissing the reports as a ""groundless escalation of tensions."" He insisted that ""Russia poses no threat to anyone,"" and accused NATO of stoking tensions by being ""very, very active and assertive in the immediate vicinity of our borders, whether it is air, water, or whether it is land."" Europe and American concerns over Russia's military posturing along the Ukrainian border come amid another standoff between Eastern and Western powers, with innocent migrants and refugees caught in the middle. Europe and the U.S. believe Belarus' Russian-backed autocratic regime has deliberately lured thousands of desperate people from conflict zones to travel to Belarus with the hope of then crossing the country's border onto EU soil in neighboring Poland. Thousands of migrants, many from Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and other war-torn nations, have massed along the Belarusian border over the last week — along with hundreds of security forces on both sides — sleeping in makeshift camps in freezing conditions with little or no provision for their basic needs. EU sanctions against Belarus, levied over the summer in response to strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko's treatment of dissidents and pro-democracy activists, are thought to be the motivation for his regime's ""instrumentalization"" of migration, which the EU sees as a means of retribution. Speaking Friday during a visit to Paris, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said the Biden administration was ""very concerned"" about the Belarusian state's actions along the border, and ""closely paying attention to it."" ""The Lukashenko regime, I believe, is engaged in very troubling activity. It is something that I discussed with [French] President Macron, and the eyes of the world and its leaders are watching what is happening there,"" she said. Lukashenko ratcheted up the pressure, meanwhile, warning he could cut off natural gas supplies to Western Europe, which flow through his country from Russia, bringing significant funds to the Belarusian state budget. But on Friday his Russian backers made it clear the threat from Lukashenko was made without consultation, and the Kremlin said Russian gas would keep flowing to Europe as the cold winter months approached. Moscow and Belarus did, however, announce a sudden ""surprise combat readiness"" training exercise on Friday, for which Russian paratroopers were flown into the neighboring country. Belarus' defense ministry said the exercise was planned due to ""the build-up of military activity"" near its border.",4,4.004830372724238,4.722159216978949,-0.7173288442547108,17
2021-11-08,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-attacks-united-states-6-million/,U.S. seizes over $6 million from ransomware attacks,"The Justice Department announced Monday that U.S. officials have seized more than $6 million in cryptocurrency and arrested two individuals they say are behind the July 4 weekend REvil ransomware attacks, in which the hacking of a Florida-based software firm Kaseya infected more than a thousand businesses worldwide. Ukrainian National Yaroslav Vasinskyi was arrested in Poland last month after crossing over the Ukrainian border and has been indicted on 11 federal counts for allegedly creating and utilizing the ransomware program colloquially known as REvil to demand hundreds of thousands of dollars from 10 American entities and companies. ""The Poles have been terrific partners. We're very grateful for their assistance,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray told reporters Monday. Russian national Yevgeniy Igorevich Polyanin is also accused of ""authoring"" the REVIL ransomware and is charged with 14 counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer, and money laundering. U.S. officials alleged the cybercriminal conducted 3,000 ransomware attacks in total. According to court documents, Polyanin used REvil to infiltrate more than a dozen government entities in August of 2019. ""Today, and now for the second time in 5 months, we announce the seizure of digital proceeds of ransomware deployed by a transnational criminal group,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said. ""This will not be the last time. The U.S. government will continue to aggressively pursue the entire ransomware ecosystem and increase our nation's resilience to cyber threats."" In May, the federal government recovered approximately $2.3 million dollars in cryptocurrency from Russia-based hacking group Darkside, after cybercriminals had attacked the country's largest fuel pipeline, prompting gas shortages across the southeastern U.S. Garland announced Monday that REvil ransomware alone has been deployed on approximately 175,000 computers worldwide, with at least $200 million paid in ransom. According to the two separate indictments unsealed Monday in the Northern District of Texas, Vasinskyi, Polyanin and unnamed co-conspirators designed the malicious computer program, also called Sodinokibi, with the intent of using it to hold computer systems hostage in exchange for cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Monero. Prosecutors allege the program's designers used it to ""infect victims' computers in various ways, including by deploying phishing emails to collect the recipients' credentials and to deliver malware."" Once the hackers gained sufficient access to the networks, they allegedly encrypted the files and held the then-encrypted information on the computers as ransom, demanding cryptocurrency in return for decryption keys. The indictment alleges Vasinskyi held the encrypted data of one company from Fairfield, New Jersey, for $700,000 ransom. In some instances, to prove to the attacked companies that their threats were legitimate, investigators say the hackers posted some of the information they gathered on a blog in an attempt to further threaten their victims. In all, the men are accused of using REvil to attack dozens of protected computer networks in the government, nonprofit, financial services, and information technology sectors, including the Forida-based Kaseya for which Vasinskyi is allegedly responsible. Polyanin, of Russia, remains at large. If convicted of all counts, each faces a maximum penalty of 115 and 145 years in prison, respectively. Alex Iftimie, a former national security official at the Department of Justice, tells CBS News that Monday's action has ""lifted the veil of anonymity"" that typically shields cyber criminals. The arrest of Vasinskyi could tip the scale for would-be hackers considering joining a ransomware group. ""The U.S. government has done a lot here to change the risk calculus for ransomware actors who are thinking, 'I too can have a Maserati if I engage in this kind of conduct,"" Iftmie, a partner at Morrison & Foerster, added. Along with the Kaseya attack, the FBI formerly attributed a May ransomware attack on JBS USA, to REvil. The world's largest meat processing company announced in June that it paid an $11 million ransom to REvil cybercriminals after it was forced to halt cattle-slaughtering operations at 13 of its meat processing plants. Earlier this year, REvil reportedly demanded $50 million from Apple ahead of its product launch after hacking one of its suppliers, Quanta Computer. In 2020, ransomware payments reached over $400 million, according to the FBI, a nearly 21% increase in reported ransomware cases and a 225% increase in associated losses compared to 2019. Monday's cyber crackdown represents a significant step in the Biden administration's long-term mission to counter ransomware attacks, which began to proliferate during the pandemic, culminating in a number of critical infrastructure breaches earlier this year. But while ransomware attacks continue, law enforcement's success in tracking down perpetrators has led some of the actors to cool down operations in recent months. U.S. Cyber Command, the Department of Defense's offensive arm, targeted REvil's servers last month, prompting the cybercriminals to shut down their website used to extort victims, according to The Washington Post. Last week, Romanian authorities arrested two more alleged REvil operatives, Europol announced Monday. South Korean authorities extradited a Russian man accused of participating in a different cyber criminal ring to the United States, last month. In June, President Biden pressured Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop giving safe harbor to cybercriminals in Russia, after a slew of cyber attacks. National Security Agency Director General Paul Nakasone said last week it was ""too soon to tell"" if the Kremlin has facilitated the international hunt for cybercriminals after the United States handed over names of wanted suspects. Kaseya Senior Vice President Dana Liedholm thanked the FBI for its help in pursuing the the cyber thieves responsible for July's supply chain hack. ""From day one, the FBI has, and continues to be, a great partner to us,"" Liedholm said in a statement. Wray called Monday's cyber crackdown ""yet another example highlighting why the public needs breach reporting legislation that provides the FBI real time access to information about ransomware attacks."" On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators moved to include a provision in the defense budget that would require certain critical infrastructure groups to report major cyber incidents to the government within 72 hours. The amendment, written by top Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and Senate Intelligence Committee, also requires certain infrastructure groups, nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, and businesses report ransom payments made to cybercriminals within 24 hours.",20,3.821006288519391,1.5491593507423402,2.2718469377770507,2

At President Biden's request, Burns was leading a delegation of senior American officials on a two-day trip to Moscow. ""They are meeting with members of the Russian government to discuss a range of issues in the bilateral relationship,"" the spokesperson said. The interaction comes amid simmering tensions with the Kremlin, although at the same time, the Biden administration is trying to foster a more stable and predictable relationship after issuing a raft of sanctions for past offenses in April. Mr. Biden met in June with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva to discuss areas of potential cooperation, including arms control and cybersecurity, among other topics. But U.S.-Russia relations have continued to be turbulent; Kremlin-linked hackers are still launching ransomware attacks on U.S. companies, and Moscow persists in its efforts to meddle in U.S. elections. And earlier this week, satellite imagery showed Russian armored units, soldiers and artillery nearing Ukraine's border, renewing concerns about a potential military incursion. Moscow's diplomatic engagements with the West have been souring on several fronts. Last month, NATO announced it was expelling eight Russian diplomats it alleged were undeclared Russian intelligence officers and reduced Russia's delegation to the alliance, prompting Moscow to shut down NATO's outpost there. The Kremlin has also banned the American embassy from employing local Russian staff, virtually eliminating its ability to issue visas or provide other consular services, U.S. officials said last week. On Tuesday, Russia's Security Council posted a photograph of Burns meeting with its Secretary, Nikolai Patrushev, a former director of Russia's domestic intelligence service and close associate of President Vladimir Putin. ""The parties discussed Russian-American relations,"" its one-sentence caption said. The CIA declined to comment on Burns' travel, and a spokesperson for the National Security Council declined to elaborate on the agenda for the American delegation in Moscow or why Burns was tapped to lead it. Since he became CIA director, Burns has spoken publicly about health incidents known as ""Havana Syndrome"" that have befallen more than 200 American officials — including 100 intelligence officers. He has said Russia ""could be"" behind the incidents, which can cause dizziness, nausea and debilitating headaches, but he and other senior intelligence officials have stressed that agencies have not determined their cause. It was not clear whether Burns would address the health incidents while he's in Moscow — they were raised briefly by the president during his June summit with Putin, a senior administration official said. A former deputy secretary of state who, over a three-decade career in diplomacy, served as U.S. ambassador to Russia and Jordan, Burns has engaged numerous times in recent months with counterparts in fraught diplomatic and security situations. In August, he met with leading Taliban officials in Kabul as the U.S. scrambled to complete its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Before that, Burns met with then-president Ashraf Ghani at CIA headquarters, where the two discussed the embattled leader's handling of a potential political transition.

2021-10-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nra-hack-ransomware-gang-grief-russia/,Ransomware gang says it hacked the National Rifle Association,"A ransomware gang believed to operate out of Russia says it hacked the National Rifle Association, the most powerful gun-rights group in the United States. The gang, which calls itself Grief, published a handful of what appear to be the NRA files on a so-called dark web site. The files, reviewed by The Associated Press, relate to grants the NRA has awarded. Ransomware gangs often post a victim's files publicly in hopes of spurring them to pay out a ransom. The NRA did not immediately return a request for comment. But a person with direct knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity said the NRA has had problems with its email system this week — a potential sign of a ransomware attack. Ransomware attacks have spiked in recent years against all manner of companies and organizations, but rarely are the targets as politically sensitive as the NRA. The group has long enjoyed close ties to top Republican lawmakers and been a been a major supporter of Republican candidates. The NRA spent tens of millions of dollar in the past two presidential elections trying to help Donald Trump. The group has been beset by legal and financial troubles in recent years but remains a potent force politically and has more than 5 million members. Allan Liska, an intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said it's highly unusual for a politically active group such as the NRA to be targeted by ransomware gangs, but he said there is no evidence the attack was politically motivated. He said ransomware gangs usually do not target organizations, but rather vulnerable technologies. ""It's not likely that this was specifically targeted at the NRA — the NRA just happened to get hit,"" he said. ""You never know, though."" Liska said the email problems could be related to the ransomware attack. He said email systems are top targets of ransomware gangs because they often contain sensitive information and hamper an organization's response to an attack, further incentivizing them to pay a ransom. Victims of ransomware attacks run the risk of repeat attacks, according to a report published by U.S. cybersecurity firm, Cybereason. The Boston-based firm found that 80% of organizations that previously paid ransom demands confirmed they were exposed to a second attack, according to a commissioned survey of 1,263 cybersecurity professionals in varying industries from the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, France, United Arab Emirates and Singapore. Spokespeople for the FBI did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Greif is believed by many cybersecurity experts to be linked to Evil Corp, a ransomware gang that was previously active. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the group in 2019, saying it had stolen more than $100 million from banks and financial institutions in 40 countries. U.S. and Russian ties have already been strained this year over a string of high-profile ransomware attacks against American targets launched by Russia-linked cyber gangs. According to research from cybersecurity firm Analyst1, Russian intelligence services worked with prominent ransomware gangs to compromise U.S. government and government-affiliated organizations. President Joe Biden has warned Russian President Vladimir Putin in an effort to get him to crack down on ransomware criminals, but several top Biden administration cybersecurity officials have said recently that they have yet to see evidence of that.",20,1.7945654962678521,2.7776370416000717,-0.9830715453322196,2
2021-10-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-russian-hackers-nobelium-cloud-services-supply-chain/,"Microsoft says Russia-backed hackers are targeting cloud services, supply chain","Microsoft says the same Russia-backed hackers responsible for the 2020 SolarWinds breach continue to attack the global technology supply chain and have been relentlessly targeting cloud service companies and others since summer. The group, which Microsoft calls Nobelium, has employed a new strategy to piggyback on the direct access that cloud service resellers have to their customers' IT systems, hoping to ""more easily impersonate an organization's trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers,"" Microsoft said. Resellers act as intermediaries between software and hardware makers and product users. ""Fortunately, we have discovered this campaign during its early stages, and we are sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers, technology providers, and their customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful,"" the Seattle-based software giant said in a blog post on Sunday. ""This is the same actor behind the cyberattacks targeting SolarWinds customers in 2020 and which the U.S. government and others have identified as being part of Russia's foreign intelligence service known as the SVR,"" the company said. SVR is one of two Russian intelligence bureaus that were linked to prominent ransomware gangs in a report earlier this year by cybersecurity firm Analyst1. Russian intelligence services worked with cybercriminals to compromise U.S. government and government-affiliated organizations, the report said. The ransomware groups used a technique called ""domain fronting"" to hide their activity. They likely relied on a time-tested hacking tool called Mimikatz to infiltrate targeted systems, then distributed malware using a PowerShell Windows application, according to Analyst1. The Biden administration downplayed the impact of the Russian efforts. A U.S. government official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record noted that ""the activities described were unsophisticated password spray and phishing, run-of-the mill operations for the purpose of surveillance that we already know are attempted every day by Russia and other foreign governments."" Microsoft has been observing Nobelium's latest campaign since May and has notified more than 140 companies targeted by the group, with as many as 14 believed to have been compromised. The attacks have increased dramatically since July, Microsoft noted. The company wrote that it told 609 customers that they had been attacked 22,868 times by Nobelium between July 1 and October 19, with a success rate in the low single digits. That's more attacks than Microsoft had flagged from all nation-state actors in the previous three years. Earlier this month, Microsoft reported that Russia accounted for the majority of state-sponsored hacking it detected during the past year. Most of the attacks targeted government agencies and think tanks in the United States, followed by Ukraine, Britain and European NATO members. The U.S. government has previously blamed Russia's SVR foreign intelligence agency for the SolarWinds hack, which went undetected for most of 2020, compromised several federal agencies and badly embarrassed Washington. The Russian government has denied any wrongdoing. Microsoft said the recent activity ""is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling — now or in the future — targets of interest to the Russian government.""",20,1.8945238460163463,4.004579331353589,-2.1100554853372424,16

The high-tech missile is a key component of what President Vladimir Putin touts as Russia's new, ""invincible"" generation of weapons. Hypersonic missiles fly much faster and are more agile than standard ones, making them much more difficult for missile defense systems to stop. The U.S. military conducted its first flight test of a hypersonic missile system in 2011. The missile was launched from the Severodvinsk nuclear submarine from a depth of 131 feet and hit a test target in the Barents Sea, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement accompanied by a grainy video showing missile flares lighting up the night sky. Tsirkon had been test-fired previously from the ocean surface by a navy frigate, most recently in July. According to Putin, the missile can fly at nine-times the speed of sound, and has a range of 620 miles. Tsirkon was unveiled by Putin along with an array of other ""unparalleled"" weapons during an annual address to the nation in 2018. He boasted then that Russia's new weapons systems could ""reach anywhere in the world,"" and would be capable of evading U.S. missile defenses. ""They need to take account of a new reality and understand... [this] is not a bluff,"" Putin said of the U.S. and its allies in that speech. Among the other projects revealed at the time was the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, the air-launched Kinzhal nuclear-capable ballistic missile, and the long-range nuclear-capable cruise missile Burevestnik. Some Western experts have questioned the real capabilities of these developmental weapons, as well as their production value, but the Russian military appears to be forging ahead regardless, and claiming progress. Avangard was officially added to Russia's arsenal in 2019. A prototype of the Burevestnik, which NATO countries call the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, is believed to have crashed during secret engine tests in Russia's Arctic in August 2019, exploding during efforts to recover it from the sea and killing five scientists in the process. Previous tests of the weapon were also reportedly unsuccessful. Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has said that tests on the Tsirkon system are to be completed by the end of this year, and he expects the weapon to be commissioned by the Russian Navy in 2022, to arm cruisers, frigates, and submarines.",49,5.503157079098607,5.37227995140335,0.13087712769525695,22
2021-09-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/moscow-ramsomware-attacks/,"""No indication"" Moscow has cracked down on criminal ransomware groups, top U.S. official says","There has been ""no indication"" the Russian government has tried to rein in criminal ransomware groups known to be operating from its soil, a top FBI official said Tuesday, despite the repeated insistence in recent months by the U.S. government that it should do so. ""Based on what we've seen, I would say there is no indication that the Russian government has taken action to crack down on ransomware actors that are operating in the permissive environment that they've created there,"" said Paul Abbate, deputy director of the FBI. ""We've asked for help and cooperation with those who we know are in Russia, who we have indictments against, and we've seen no action."" ""So I would say that nothing's changed in that regard,"" he said. Abbate and several other senior national security officials spoke Tuesday at an annual summit convened by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance. CBS News moderated some of the panels at the gathering. In July, President Biden said he told President Putin in a phone conversation that the U.S. expected Putin to take action to disrupt Russia-based ransomware groups. ""I made it very clear to him that the United States expects that when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it is not sponsored by the state, we expect him to act if we give him enough information to act on who that is,"" Mr. Biden said at the time. The phone call followed an in-person summit between the two presidents during which Mr. Biden warned of ""consequences"" for cyberattacks originating in Russia. The Russia-linked REvil gang, best known for extorting $11 million from the meat-processor JBS in May, fell quiet for several weeks following the presidential summit, but reemerged publicly late last week. It, along with a different criminal group known as DarkSide — which attacked fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline in May — has demanded multi-million dollar payments from victim companies in the past year. National Cyber Director Chris Inglis said at an event hosted by the Reagan Institute last week that attacks were unlikely to stop, absent intervention by Moscow. ""What I think will make the difference is whether Vladimir Putin and others who have the ability to enforce the law, international law…will ensure that they don't come back,"" Inglis said. General Paul Nakasone, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, said Tuesday that ""options,"" which could include offensive operations, would be prepared for Mr. Biden to review. ""[A]s the president determines a way forward, we will provide a number of different options that are available, and that's across all of our agencies, and certainly U.S. Cyber Command,"" Nakasone said.",20,4.102800704133929,1.7167939310368805,2.3860067730970487,26
2021-07-27,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-intelligence-community-speech-watch-live-stream-today-07-27-2021/,"Biden urges ""vigilance"" by intelligence community in first visit as president","Washington — President Biden urged the U.S. intelligence community on Tuesday to act with ""vigilance"" and speed to confront new and evolving security challenges ranging from climate change to cyber conflict to a more militarily assertive China. In public remarks delivered at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in Virginia, his first visit since taking office, Mr. Biden warned that the rapid pace and immense scale of changes in technology, global alliances and climate would place an ""enormous burden"" on the men and women of the intelligence community to keep the U.S. competitive on the world stage. ""Threats that are more geographically dispersed than they were 20 years ago — they're going to require vigilance. And we have to continue efforts to better understand some of the hardest, the most important intelligence targets we face as a nation,"" Mr. Biden said. ""But we also need to make sure we position ourselves to stay ahead of the security challenges that will stretch the [intelligence community] in new ways it has never been stretched before,"" he added. The president cited looming challenges from China and Russia — which he described as ""potentially mortal competitors, down the road"" — and said he thought significant disruptions in the cyber domain could risk leading to armed conflict. ""I can't guarantee this, and you're as informed as I am, but I think it's more likely, we're going to end up, we end up in a war, a real shooting war with a major power — it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach, ""Mr. Biden said. He also alluded to new election and misinformation threats emanating from Russia, whose efforts to target the 2022 election were described, he said, in the day's presidential daily brief. ""In today's PDB you all prepared for me, look what Russia is doing already about the 2022 elections and misinformation. It's a pure violation of our sovereignty,"" Biden said. He described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a leader with dwindling resources and options, but warned as a result he posed a more serious threat. ""When I was with Mr. Putin, who has a real problem — he is sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and nothing else,"" Mr. Biden said. ""He knows he's in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous in my view."" Mr. Biden also said President Xi Jinping of China was ""deadly earnest"" about building the most powerful military and largest economy in the world. In what appeared to be a slip of classified information, he began to mention a recent revelation about ""hypersonics"" before moving on. Still, he said cooperation with Russia and China would be necessary, especially in the face of ""shared"" dangers like climate change, which he said was already accelerating instability in the US and worldwide. The president said several times that political considerations should not interfere with the intelligence community's efforts, and vowed he would not use any agencies' findings for partisan purposes. ""It is so vital that you are and should be totally free of any political pressure or partisan interference,"" he said. ""I'll never politicize the work you do. You have my word on that."" Mr. Biden also expressed gratitude for what he acknowledged was a largely unknown sacrifice on the part of the intelligence community's workforce and said the country was ""safer"" and ""stronger"" because of it. While Mr. Biden has insisted on receiving intelligence free of politics, he has nonetheless charged the community with what have become high-profile and politically charged pursuits. In May, Mr. Biden asked agencies to ""redouble"" their efforts to investigate the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, setting a deadline of 90 days for them to ""collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion."" The intelligence community has been, for well over a year, weighing two possible scenarios — human contact with an infected animal or a lab accident. Administration and intelligence officials have said two intelligence agencies lean toward one scenario, and one toward the other. Both Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and CIA Director William Burns have already said publicly it was possible the intelligence community would never arrive at a definitive answer. Intelligence agencies are also focused on determining the cause of a mysterious illness known colloquially as ""Havana Syndrome,"" which has sickened at least 100 intelligence officers and family members since 2016. A total of 200 American officers, including diplomats and military personnel, are thought to have been affected, and lawmakers of both parties have requested more answers on the incidents' origin. While intelligence officials have said they have reached no conclusion about what causes the illness — including whether it might be the work of a foreign actor — one prevalent theory is that the cases are the result of attempted intelligence collection by Russian government operatives. In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Biden said his administration was taking the health incidents ""very seriously."" The community is also grappling with what amounts to a seismic shift in its mandate and principal areas of focus, which have in recent years edged away from counterterrorism and toward broader, more amorphous challenges, including climate change, disease outbreaks and geopolitical instability. Leaders have also consistently said the paramount challenge for US national security will be competition with Beijing, which Burns has said the CIA would confront with ""intensified focus and energy.""",20,3.1424301269120414,3.156930632869094,-0.014500505957052656,18
2021-07-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-white-house-cybersecurity-task-force-calls-for-retaliation-russia/,White House launches ransomware task force amid calls for retaliation against Russia,"Washington — Following a slew of high-profile ransomware attacks, the Biden administration has formed a multi-agency government task force aimed at curtailing malicious, state-sponsored cyber activity and hardening the nation's cybersecurity defenses, as more and more of American critical infrastructure migrates online. The weekly, cross-agency summits held by the task force have kickstarted a series of initiatives aimed at building up digital resilience among small businesses, preventing anonymized cryptocurrency platforms from being used for ransom payments and offering up to nine figures in cash rewards for information leading to the arrests of state-linked ransomware actors. Lawmakers and private industry leaders have piled pressure on President Joe Biden as the White House contemplates more forceful retaliation in response to what U.S. officials consider Russian President Vladimir Putin's failure to curb ransomware operators. The cyberattacks that led to the days-long fuel shortage on the East Coast, halted one of America's largest beef suppliers and hamstrung thousands of businesses over the July 4th weekend have fueled calls for tougher action. ""We're looking for an enduring impact on the ransomware that's plaguing companies around the world, governments around the world,"" a senior administration official told reporters on Wednesday. ""No one thing will achieve that."" The kitchen-sink approach to cybercrime harnesses the collective authorities and skillsets of the Departments of Justice (DOJ), Homeland Security (DHS), State and Treasury, among other agencies. DHS' cyber arm, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), will unveil a new website, stopransomware.gov, as a one-stop-shopping hub for small businesses looking for tips to boost their security and resiliency to attacks. Government agencies led by the Department of Justice will work to halt ransom payments made through anonymized cryptocurrency platforms. ""The exploitation of virtual currency to launder ransomware proceeds is, without question, facilitating ransomware,"" a senior administration official told reporters. ""There's inadequate international regulation of virtual currency activity, which is a key factor in how cybercriminals are able to launder their funds, demand ransomware payments, and fuel sophisticated cybercrime as a service business model."" But experts say that halting illicit transactions with virtual money, and tackling ransomware more broadly, will require intense international cooperation. Political leaders at the latest G7 Summit in the U.K. addressed ransomware at length. They called on all nations to ""urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders."" But many of America's European allies continue to rely on Russian energy supplies, which may dampen calls for harsher retaliation. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or ""FINCEN"" plans to host a virtual conference on ransomware with ""institutions, technology firms, third party service providers and federal government agencies to discuss ongoing concerns regarding ransomware,"" according to a senior administration official. The State Department plans to commission a ""Rewards for Justice"" program, paying up to $10 million in cash in exchange for tips leading to the arrests of state-linked ransomware actors. Only days after the president and lawmakers called on Russia to sanction ransomware groups targeting Americans, the ""REvil"" cybercriminal gang, which carried out this month's attack on American software company Kaseya, disappeared off the dark web. Both the group's blog site and ransom negotiation portal shut down, CBS News confirmed. It remains unclear whether the U.S. or Russia disrupted REvil's online infrastructure, or if the criminals simply decided to pull back as other groups have done when they come under the scrutiny of U.S. intelligence and cybersecurity agencies. Asked whether the U.S. government had done anything to take down REvil's websites or pressured Russia to do so, a senior administration official would only say that White House officials had ""noted the disruption of the REvil infrastructure and have no further comments on that at this time."" President Biden and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have indicated that the U.S. government is still searching for signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin took last month's diplomatic summit in Geneva to heart. ""We're looking for meaningful, meaningful progress on ransomware, particularly that's disruptive to critical infrastructure,"" the senior administration official said. ""So we're watching closely, and we are looking for the Russians to make progress."" During a news conference on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied any direct knowledge or involvement in REvil's abrupt disappearance, saying he didn't ""know which group has disappeared from where."" Anne Neuberger, U.S. deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, briefed senators on the administration's plan during a 35-minute phone call on Wednesday. That call was followed later in the evening by a briefing for all House members. While Neuberger dominated much of the call, one Senate aide said the Biden administration had gained two more notable cyber leaders: Chris Inglis was sworn in as the first-ever national cyber director last month, overseeing the national cyber strategy from the White House and, on Tuesday, following a drawn-out confirmation process, Jen Easterly began work as director of CISA, installing its first Senate-confirmed leader in more than eight months. In their discussions with congressional leaders, the officials requested new authorities to establish mandatory cyber standards for operators of critical infrastructure, according to Senate aides. In May, following the Colonial Pipeline hack, DHS mandated cybersecurity regulations for the nation's leading pipeline companies,. But a majority of the nation's critical infrastructure sectors — including dams, public health and agriculture — still do not impose mandatory cyber standards. Lawmaker efforts to institute mandatory cyber requirements dictated by Congress failed nearly a decade ago in the face of strong industry dissent. The federal government's ransomware task force rollout comes as Congress considers bolstering cybersecurity funding, and debates legislation that would obligate critical infrastructure companies to report hacks directly to the federal agencies.",20,2.2761134514465686,1.7264254801220809,0.5496879713244878,2

The president said he's ""optimistic"" about his relationship with Putin. But when a reporter asked if there would be consequences for these attacks, Mr. Biden replied, ""Yes."" In a readout of the call with Putin, the White House said that Mr. Biden ""underscored the need for Russia to take action to disrupt ransomware groups operating in Russia and emphasized that he is committed to continued engagement on the broader threat posed by ransomware."" The Russia-linked REvil gang, best known for extorting $11 million from the meat-processor JBS in May, last week infected thousands of victims in at least 17 countries, and on Sunday initially demanded $70 million in cryptocurrency as ransom to end the attack. As part of the holiday weekend attack, the U.S.-based software company Kaseya was targeted, impacting 1,500 small businesses managed by its customers. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Mr. Biden ""made clear"" to Putin ""that the United States will take any necessary action to defend its people and its critical infrastructure."" ""This was an example of leader to leader diplomacy, something the president feels is vital as he operates in the world,"" Psaki said. Mr. Biden and Putin met for a summit in Geneva last month, where the president urged Putin to crack down on cyberattacks originating in Russia. The Russian president has repeatedly denied any involvement or direct knowledge of recent attacks. Mr. Biden told reporters after the summit that Putin ""knows there are consequences"" and said Russia's credibility ""shrinks"" when it participates in cyberattacks. He also presented Putin with a list of 16 critical infrastructure entities that should be off-limits to cyberattacks, a list provided by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Those 16 sectors are: Chemical; commercial facilities; communication; critical manufacturing; dams; defense industrial base; emergency services; energy; financial services; food and agriculture; government facilities; healthcare and public health; information technology; nuclear reactors, materials and waste; transportation systems and water and waste management systems.

2021-07-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-attack-revil-hackers-demand-70-million/,REvil hackers demand $70 million to end biggest ransomware attack on record,"Cybersecurity teams are working feverishly to stem the impact of the single biggest global ransomware attack on record, with some details emerging about how the Russia-linked gang behind it breached the company whose software was the conduit. An affiliate of the notorious REvil gang, best known for extorting $11 million from the meat-processor JBS after a Memorial Day attack, infected thousands of victims in at least 17 countries on Friday, largely through firms that remotely manage IT infrastructure for multiple customers, cybersecurity researchers said. REvil was demanding ransoms of up to $5 million, the researchers said. But late Sunday it offered in a posting on its dark web site a universal decryptor software key that would unscramble all affected machines in exchange for $70 million in cryptocurrency. Earlier, the FBI said in a statement that while it was investigating the attack its scale ""may make it so that we are unable to respond to each victim individually."" Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger later issued a statement saying President Joe Biden had ""directed the full resources of the government to investigate this incident"" and urged all who believed they were compromised to alert the FBI. Mr. Biden suggested Saturday the U.S. would respond if it was determined that the Kremlin is at all involved. Less than a month ago, he pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop giving safe haven to REvil and other ransomware gangs whose unrelenting extortionary attacks the U.S. deems a national security threat. On Monday, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked if Russia was aware of the attack or had looked into it. He said no, but suggested it could be discussed by the U.S. and Russia in consultations on cybersecurity issues for which no timeline has been specified. A broad array of businesses and public agencies were hit by the latest attack, apparently on all continents, including in financial services, travel and leisure and the public sector, though few large companies, the cybersecurity firm Sophos reported. Ransomware criminals infiltrate networks and sow malware that cripples them by scrambling all their data. Victims get a decoder key when they pay up. The Swedish grocery chain Coop said most of its 800 stores would be closed for a second day Sunday because their cash register software supplier was crippled. A Swedish pharmacy chain, gas station chain, the state railway and public broadcaster SVT were also hit. In Germany, an unnamed IT services company told authorities several thousand of its customers were compromised, the news agency dpa reported. Also among reported victims were two big Dutch IT services companies, VelzArt and Hoppenbrouwer Techniek. Most ransomware victims don't publicly report attacks or disclose if they've paid ransoms. CEO Fred Voccola of the breached software company, Kaseya, estimated the victim number in the low thousands, mostly small businesses like ""dental practices, architecture firms, plastic surgery centers, libraries, things like that."" The company said Monday in a notice posted on its website that it ""has unfortunately been the victim of a sophisticated cyberattack."" Voccola said in an interview that only 50 to 60 of the company's 37,000 customers were compromised. But 70% were managed service providers who use the company's hacked VSA software to manage multiple customers. It automates the installation of software and security updates and manages backups and other vital tasks. Experts say it was no coincidence that REvil launched the attack at the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend, knowing U.S. offices would be lightly staffed. Many victims may not learn of it until they are back at work on Monday. Most end users of managed service providers ""have no idea"" whose software keep their networks humming, said Voccola, Kaseya said it sent a detection tool to nearly 900 customers on Saturday night. ""We have been advised by our outside experts that customers who experienced ransomware and receive communication from the attackers should not click on any links — they may be weaponized,"" the company warned. The REvil offer to offer blanket decryption for all victims of the Kaseya attack in exchange for $70 million suggested its inability to cope with the sheer quantity of infected networks, said Allan Liska, an analyst with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. Although analysts reported seeing demands of $5 million and $500,000 for bigger targets, it was apparently demanding $45,000 for most. ""This attack is a lot bigger than they expected and it is getting a lot of attention. It is in REvil's interest to end it quickly,"" said Liska. ""This is a nightmare to manage."" Analyst Brett Callow, of Emsisoft, said he suspects REvil is hoping insurers might crunch the numbers and determine the $70 million will be cheaper for them than extended downtime. Kevin Reed of Acronis said the offer of a universal decryptor could be a PR stunt because no human involvement would be needed to pay a $45,000 base ransom demand apparently sent to the vast majority of targets. Analysts reported seeing demands of $5 million and $500,000 for bigger targets, which would require negotiation. Sophisticated ransomware gangs on REvil's level usually examine a victim's financial records — and insurance policies if they can find them — from files they steal before activating the ransomware. The criminals then threaten to dump the stolen data online unless paid. In this attack, that appears not to have happened. Dutch researchers said they alerted Miami-based Kaseya to the breach and said the criminals used a ""zero day,"" the industry term for a previous unknown security hole in software. Voccola wouldn't confirm that or offer details of the breach - except to say that it wasn't phishing. ""The level of sophistication here was extraordinary,"" he said. When the cybersecurity firm Mandiant finishes its investigation, Voccola said he is confident it will show that the criminals didn't just violate Kaseya code in breaking into his network but also exploited vulnerabilities in third-party software. It wasn't the first ransomware attack to leverage managed services providers. In 2019, criminals hobbled the networks of 22 Texas municipalities through one. That same year, 400 U.S. dental practices were crippled in a separate attack. One of the Dutch vulnerability researchers, Victor Gevers, said his team is worried about products like Kaseya's VSA because of the total control of vast computing resources they can offer. ""More and more of the products that are used to keep networks safe and secure are showing structural weaknesses,"" he wrote in a blog Sunday. The cybersecurity firm ESET identified victims in least 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Mexico, Indonesia, New Zealand and Kenya. Kaseya says the attack only affected ""on-premise"" customers, organizations running their own data centers, as opposed to its cloud-based services that run software for customers. It also shut down those servers as a precaution, however. Kaseya, which called on customers Friday to shut down their VSA servers immediately, said Sunday it hoped to have a patch in the next few days. Active since April 2019, REvil provides ransomware-as-a-service, meaning it develops the network-paralyzing software and leases it to so-called affiliates who infect targets and earn the lion's share of ransoms. U.S. officials say the most potent ransomware gangs are based in Russia and allied states and operate with Kremlin tolerance and sometimes collude with Russian security services. Businesses around the world are attacked using ransomware roughly every 11 seconds, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. The security firm projects that global ransomware losses this year will reach $20 billion. Cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch, of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank, said that while he doesn't believe the Kaseya attack is Kremlin-directed, it shows that Putin ""has not yet moved"" on shutting down cybercriminals.

2021-07-04,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/solarwinds-60-minutes-2021-07-04/,How U.S. cyber policy changed after SolarWinds,"In March of last year, thousands of companies and U.S. government agencies were sent a routine software update. This happened regularly with SolarWinds Orion software. There was no reason to suspect anything was wrong with the update. What they couldn't see at the time was a malicious piece of code buried deep within the update, a Trojan horse planted by Russian military hackers looking for a backdoor to important American computer networks. Nine months after that compromised software update, cybersecurity firm FireEye sounded the alarm. They had been hacked. Their crown jewels, what the company calls ""Red Team tools,"" had been stolen. FireEye suspected that anyone who had downloaded and installed the SolarWinds Orion update had been hacked too. The U.S. Treasury Department, Department of Justice, State Department, Energy Department, and the agency that protects and transports the U.S. nuclear arsenal, didn't see the Russians rummaging through their computer networks for nine months. Businesses, including software titan Microsoft, also found their systems compromised by the update. SolarWinds says its products are used by 300,000 customers around the globe, and that 18,000 customers downloaded its compromised software update. In February, 60 Minutes spoke to cybersecurity experts who said they believe the U.S. government's strategy for cyber warfare is inadequate and does not effectively deter its adversaries in cyberspace, including Chris Inglis, who was later chosen by the Biden administration to become the nation's first National Cyber Director. A month after 60 Minutes first aired its report on SolarWinds, the Biden administration levied sanctions against Russia, blaming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) for the SolarWinds hack. President Biden has also taken executive action to bolster U.S. cybersecurity and spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about recent cyberattacks on the U.S., although Russia has denied responsibility for the hack. Last month, the Senate confirmed Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, as National Cyber Director— a new White House role created this January when the National Defense Authorization Act passed in Congress. White House Advisor Jake Sullivan said Inglis would bring ""deep expertise, experience and leadership"" when the nomination was announced. In an interview with Bill Whitaker this February, Inglis said the separation between government and private enterprise, while bound by law and in line with American values, makes coordination on cyber defense difficult. Without a united line of defense, that separation can be exploited by an aggressor. ""It turns out that a division of effort is actually an agreement to not collaborate,"" he said. ""One party's attempting to defend their patch and another party's defending their patch. Both sides are ignorant. And the aggressor can pick you off one at a time."" He suggested greater collaboration between government and private business to identify and address cyber threats. ""Unless there's some collaboration of the defenders,"" he explained, ""No one person is going to have the god's eye view of what's happening in that network."" In an executive order this May, President Biden created strict new security standards that supply chain software companies like SolarWinds must meet to do business with the federal government. The order also requires those companies to maintain a vulnerability disclosure program and make automated security checks public. ""Protecting our Nation from malicious cyber actors requires the Federal Government to partner with the private sector,"" President Biden said in the order. ""The private sector must adapt to the continuously changing threat environment, ensure its products are built and operate securely, and partner with the Federal Government to foster a more secure cyberspace."" In his confirmation hearing last month, Chris Inglis said hacks like SolarWinds ""signal the urgent need to secure our national critical infrastructure"" and that his duties as National Cyber Director would require ""robust engagement"" with the private sector. In April, President Biden ordered the Treasury to designate six Russian technology companies believed to be providing support to the Russian Intelligence Service (SVR). ""We will continue to hold Russia accountable for its malicious cyber activities, such as the SolarWinds incident, by using all available policy and authorities,"" the White House said. Last month, Biden met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland. They spoke for roughly three hours, discussing cybersecurity, arms control, and other topics. Biden said the meeting was ""constructive."" Both leaders addressed reporters in separate news conferences afterward. Biden told reporters that Putin ""knows I will take action"" to stop Russia from engaging in hacking attacks, like those targeting SolarWinds. Biden added Putin ""knows there are consequences"" and said Russia's credibility ""shrinks"" when it participates in cyberattacks. When asked if he was confident Putin would change his behavior, he said, ""I'm not confident of anything."" In a separate press conference, Mr. Putin said the two countries would engage in ""consultations"" related to cybersecurity but denied Russian responsibility for recent cyberattacks. In a conversation with Bill Whitaker this February, James Lewis, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said fear of escalation has held the U.S. back from punishing Russia, and other nation-states, when they step out of line. ""Escalation's a reasonable concern. But it shouldn't be enough to say, 'Oh, we shouldn't do anything because the Russians might be mad,'"" he said. ""The goal is to make them mad. The goal is to make them afraid. How do you punish the Russians without triggering a major conflict?"" He suggested the U.S. experiment with tactics to find creative ways of inflicting revenge on Russia. ""Could you interfere with their media? Could you start putting stories in the Russian media?"" he offered. ""The one that bothers them the most is corruption because it creates the popular discontent in their own populations that they don't want."" He said interfering with money allegedly stashed away in other financial systems by powerful Russians in government and business could be another deterrent. ""We could interfere a little bit with their financial activities,"" the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Lewis suggested. ""They have money squirreled all around the world."" James Lewis retains hope that the Biden administration will be more willing to explore an offensive strategy with the Russians, and other nations like China, who attack the U.S. in cyberspace. ""[Biden] could rethink how we use the exquisite capabilities that NSA and Cyber Command have to inflict pain on Russia and the others,"" he said. ""It's risky. But if we don't take risk, we're not gonna be able to work our way out of this."" The video above was originally published on February 14, 2021 and was produced by Will Croxton and Mabel Kabani.

2021-07-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/revil-cyber-attack-leaves-july-4-weekend-ransomware/,'REvil' Cyber Attack Leaves U.S. Businesses Scrambling on July 4 Weekend,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Businesses around the world rushed Saturday to contain a ransomware attack that has paralyzed their computer networks, a situation complicated in the U.S. by offices lightly staffed at the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend. It's not yet known how many organizations have been hit by demands that they pay a ransom in order to get their systems working again. But some cybersecurity researchers predict the attack targeting customers of software supplier Kaseya could be one of the broadest ransomware attacks on record. It follows a scourge of headline-grabbing attacks over recent months that have been a source of diplomatic tension between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin over whether Russia has become a safe haven for cybercriminal gangs. Biden said Saturday he didn't yet know for certain who was responsible but suggested that the U.S. would respond if Russia was found to have anything to do with it. ""If it is either with the knowledge of and or a consequence of Russia then I told Putin we will respond,"" Biden said. ""We're not certain. The initial thinking was it was not the Russian government."" Cybersecurity experts say the REvil gang, a major Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate, appears to be behind the attack that targeted the software company Kaseya, using its network-management package as a conduit to spread the ransomware through cloud-service providers. ""The number of victims here is already over a thousand and will likely reach into the tens of thousands,"" said cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank. ""No other ransomware campaign comes even close in terms of impact."" The cybersecurity firm ESET says there are victims in least 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Mexico, Kenya and Germany. In Sweden, most of the grocery chain Coop's 800 stores were unable to open because their cash registers weren't working, according to SVT, the country's public broadcaster. The Swedish State Railways and a major local pharmacy chain were also affected. Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola said in a statement that the company believes it has identified the source of the vulnerability and will ""release that patch as quickly as possible to get our customers back up and running."" Voccola said fewer than 40 of Kaseya's customers were known to be affected, but experts said the ransomware could still be affecting hundreds more companies that rely on Kaseya's clients that provide broader IT services. John Hammond of the security firm Huntress Labs said he was aware of a number of managed-services providers — companies that host IT infrastructure for multiple customers — being hit by the ransomware, which encrypts networks until the victims pay off attackers. ""It's reasonable to think this could potentially be impacting thousands of small businesses,"" said Hammond, basing his estimate on the service providers reaching out to his company for assistance and comments on Reddit showing how others are responding. At least some victims appeared to be getting ransoms set at $45,000, considered a small demand but one that could quickly add up when sought from thousands of victims, said Brett Callow, a ransomware expert at the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. Callow said it's not uncommon for sophisticated ransomware gangs to perform an audit after stealing a victim's financial records to see what they can really pay, but that won't be possible when there are so many victims to negotiate with. ""They just pitched the demand amount at a level most companies will be willing to pay,"" he said. Voccola said the problem is only affecting its ""on-premise"" customers, which means organizations running their own data centers. It's not affecting its cloud-based services running software for customers, though Kaseya also shut down those servers as a precaution, he said. The company added in a statement Saturday that ""customers who experienced ransomware and receive a communication from the attackers should not click on any links -- they may be weaponized."" Gartner analyst Katell Thielemann said it's clear that Kaseya quickly sprang to action, but it's less clear whether their affected clients had the same level of preparedness. ""They reacted with an abundance of caution,"" she said. ""But the reality of this event is it was architected for maximum impact, combining a supply chain attack with a ransomware attack."" Supply chain attacks are those that typically infiltrate widely used software and spread malware as it updates automatically. Complicating the response is that it happened at the start of a major holiday weekend in the U.S., when most corporate IT teams aren't fully staffed. That could also leave those organizations unable to address other security vulnerabilities, such a dangerous Microsoft bug affecting software for print jobs, said James Shank, of threat intelligence firm Team Cymru. ""Customers of Kaseya are in the worst possible situation,"" he said. ""They're racing against time to get the updates out on other critical bugs."" Shank said ""it's reasonable to think that the timing was planned"" by hackers for the holiday. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it was affecting hundreds of businesses and was ""another reminder that the U.S. government must take the fight to these foreign cybercriminal syndicates"" by investigating, disrupting and prosecuting them. The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement that it is closely monitoring the situation and working with the FBI to collect more information about its impact. CISA urged anyone who might be affected to ""follow Kaseya's guidance to shut down VSA servers immediately."" Kaseya runs what's called a virtual system administrator, or VSA, that's used to remotely manage and monitor a customer's network. The privately held Kaseya is based in Dublin, Ireland, with a U.S. headquarters in Miami. REvil, the group most experts have tied to the attack, was the same ransomware provider that the FBI linked to an attack on JBS SA, a major global meat processor forced to pay a $11 million ransom, amid the Memorial Day holiday weekend in May. Active since April 2019, the group provides ransomware-as-a-service, meaning it develops the network-paralyzing software and leases it to so-called affiliates who infect targets and earn the lion's share of ransoms. U.S. officials have said the most potent ransomware gangs are based in Russia and allied states and operate with Kremlin tolerance and sometimes collude with Russian security services. Alperovitch said he believes the latest attack is financially motivated and not Kremlin-directed. However, he said it shows that Putin ""has not yet moved"" on shutting down cybercriminals within Russia after Biden pressed him to do so at their June summit in Switzerland. Asked about the attack during a trip to Michigan on Saturday, Biden said he had asked the intelligence community for a ""deep dive"" on what happened. He said he expected to know more by Sunday. © Copyright 2021 Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

2021-07-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/advisory-warns-russia-linked-hackers-targeting-hundreds-of-u-s-and-european-entities/,"Russia-linked hackers targeting hundreds of U.S. and European entities, new advisory warns","Hackers from Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, are engaged in a global campaign to target ""hundreds"" of predominantly American and European entities, including government and military organizations, energy companies, think tanks and media companies, according to a new joint cybersecurity advisory issued by U.S. and U.K. national security agencies Thursday. The campaign began in mid-2019 and is ""almost certainly"" ongoing, the advisory warned, noting hackers are using an amplified and anonymized version of what are known as ""brute force"" access attempts – trying to log in to target networks by repeatedly guessing passwords – against a broad range of government and private organizations around the world. The advisory did not identify any specific victims or indicate how much or what kind of data may have been exfiltrated. It urged organizations to ""adopt and expand"" protective and mitigation techniques including multi-factor authentication, lock-out features and mandatory use of strong passwords. It said the types of targeted organizations included government and military organizations, political consultants and parties, defense contractors, energy companies, higher education institutions, logistics companies, law firms, media companies and think tanks. ""This lengthy brute force campaign to collect and exfiltrate data, access credentials and more, is likely ongoing, on a global scale,"" said Rob Joyce, the NSA's Director of Cybersecurity. ""Net defenders should use multi-factor authentication and the additional mitigations in the advisory to counter this activity."" An NSA spokesperson said this GRU-led campaign was separate from the SolarWinds supply chain attack, which was attributed to a separate Russian intelligence service known as the SVR. It is also differs from other recent, notable ransomware attacks on Colonial Pipeline or JBS meat supplier, which were targeted by two distinct criminal ransomware groups known to have links to Russia. The GRU hackers, operating as part of the elite military unit 26165 – which was also behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee as part of Moscow's sprawling 2016 election interference campaign – principally targeted Microsoft Office 365 cloud services, but also targeted and other email servers and service providers in their attempts. While the ""brute force"" technique is not new or particularly sophisticated, the GRU ""uniquely leveraged"" software containers to scale its effort, the advisory said. It was released by the National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). The hackers drew in part on an open-source platform called Kubernetes to augment and anonymize their password spray activity, which also sometimes used Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and The Onion Router (TOR). According to the advisory, once the hackers correctly identified given login credentials, they were combined with known software vulnerabilities to allow hackers to burrow deeper into victim networks, where they could access and remove data. The advisory is one of several recent disclosures made by government agencies in an attempt to help potential victim organizations protect themselves against nation-state attackers. It is also the latest in a series of cyber incursions attributed to Russia. ""The GRU appears to pursue a traditional intelligence collection campaign here by targeting organizations of strategic interest to the Russian Federation, such as energy companies, political parties, think tanks and government,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technology officer at cybersecurity company Crowdstrike and current executive chairman at Silverado Policy Accelerator. ""The danger, however, is that this campaign can easily turn from traditional espionage into a 'hack and leak' or destructive action as we have seen from past GRU attacks."" Last May, the NSA also warned that Russian hackers from the so-called ""Sandworm team"" of the GRU were exploiting a vulnerability in Exim Mail Transfer Agent, a type of popular email software. In June, after a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Biden said that the U.S. and Moscow would begin ""consultations"" on a range of cyber-related issues. The Biden administration has not offered specifics on the timing or focus of potential talks. Joyce recently said the NSA was unlikely to take part directly in any consultations with Moscow, but that it would ""absolutely"" use the agency's threat reporting to inform policymakers leading the negotiations.",20,2.0253240268430774,2.615289769190138,-0.5899657423470606,16
2021-06-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fiona-hill-sanctions-russia-alexey-navalny-face-the-nation/,"Fiona Hill welcomes ""obligatory"" new U.S. sanctions on Russia over Navalny poisoning","Washington — Dr. Fiona Hill, who served as a top adviser on Russia to former President Donald Trump, said Sunday that new sanctions the U.S. is readying against Russia in response to the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny are ""obligatory"" and believes Moscow is ""well aware"" they are coming. ""The Russians were already put on notice that the death of Navalny would be seen as a really serious event that would basically get some responses as well,"" Hill said in an interview with ""Face the Nation."" ""So I think, you know, the Russians were certainly forewarned and, you know, probably well aware that these sanctions were coming."" National security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN on Sunday that the Biden administration is preparing another sanctions package in response to Russia's targeting of Navalny, who was poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. The Russian opposition leader recovered in Germany but was jailed upon his return to Moscow in January. President Biden told reporters last week that he warned Russian President Vladimir Putin at their summit in Geneva, Switzerland, that if Navalny dies, ""the consequences of that would be devastating for Russia."" Hill, meanwhile, said the sanctions are ""actually obligatory because Navalny was poisoned, as we all now know, with Novichok, which is a banned nerve agent, essentially an illegal chemical weapon."" The substance was also used in the 2018 poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy, and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England, which triggered sanctions against Russia. ""We've discovered they kept a lot of these novel agents, probably betting on the fact that they were so secret and so highly classified when any Western governments knew about them, that nobody would ever actually get to the bottom of the use of this substance and certainly wouldn't divulge it,"" Hill said. In addition to addressing the attack on Navalny with Putin, Mr. Biden said he also warned the Russian president there would be consequences if Russian hackers target U.S. infrastructure with cyberattacks. The president said he gave Putin a list of 16 critical infrastructure entities that should be off-limits and vowed the U.S. would use its ""significant cyber capability"" to respond to malign cyber activity by Russia. ""The important point is to make that response credible, so it's not so much that we're telegraphing it publicly, but that some response happens behind the scenes,"" Hill said. ""There's a clear message sent to the Russians that they understand this."" Hill, however, said the ""dilemma"" is providing a list that is not comprehensive in terms of identifying what is off-limits and predicted there will be some covert action by Russia that goes beyond the 16 entities specified by the Biden administration. The Russians, said she, ""are very much testing the guardrails at all points, they are testing the limits."" Hill said the cyber hostility from Russia is a ""hot war,"" because action has already been taken with the sweeping breach of SolarWinds, the interference in U.S. presidential elections and ransomware attacks by hacking gangs believed to be operating on Russian soil. ""In terms of information war, I mean, we know that the Russians have been out using social media platforms, all kinds of propaganda. So we're already there,"" she said. ""I mean, what we're trying to do is try to reel that back and to basically win that back, that is, and try to get some kind of restraint here. So we're basically, I guess, now with the dilemma of, how do we do that? Can we get a comprehensive cyber agreement like we do in the nuclear weapons realm, or is that just going to be too difficult?""",20,3.6583241719797575,4.039293185494714,-0.38096901351495616,26
2021-06-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/university-colorado-cyber-attack-ukraine-clop-ransomeware/,Ukraine Authorities Arrest CL0P Ransomware Gang Linked To University Of Colorado Cyberattack,"BOULDER, Colo. (CBS4) - Criminals tied to what is believed to be the largest cyberattack on the University of Colorado appear to have been arrested in the Ukraine. CU announced the leak in February and later said that it did not pay ransom demands. The Ukraine government has released video of the arrest. The arrests are of suspects associated with the CL0P ransomware gang, believed to have targeted CU. Ukraine authorities believe the group may have caused a half-billion dollars in financial damages around the world. They claim to have shut down the infrastructure after searches of 21 homes and vehicles. It is not clear if those arrested are core members of the ransomware operation. The U.S. and South Korea helped in the international operation. The attack targeted a vulnerability in the File Transfer Appliance from Accellion, a third-party vendor. CU Boulder was notified of the data breach on Jan. 25. The university's Office of Information Security determined files uploaded by 447 CU users were at risk of unauthorized access. In March, CBS4 reported the ransomware group CL0P began gradually leaking data from more than two dozen Accellion hacks on the dark web, including data from CU. Officials said some staff who use the file transfer service received emails that their personal data had been stolen and would be published if the university didn't pay the $17 million ransom. The demand was later lowered to $5 million and the university does not intend to pay. The FBI says payment does not guarantee files will be recovered and it could encourage criminals to carry out future attacks. CU announced it will provide credit and identity monitoring along with fraud consultation and identity theft restoration to those affected by the data breach. The bulk of the data came from CU Boulder but some other files were accessed from CU Denver. CU's Colorado Springs and Anschutz Medical Campus were not affected.",20,4.5998775108259,3.773048876943939,0.826828633881961,2
2021-06-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-putin-meeting-russia-intentions-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-cbs/,"Ahead of Biden-Putin meeting, Ukraine leader says war with Russia could ""be tomorrow in their houses""","Eastern Ukraine — The trenches look like something straight out of the first world war: Ukrainian soldiers dug in only about 300 yards from Russian-backed rebel fighters. But while it looks like a war from 100 years ago, some believe the grim conflict that's been grinding on for seven years in eastern Ukraine is the front line in a new cold war brewing between Russia and the United States. CBS News correspondent Holly Williams hitched a ride with the Ukrainian military, joined by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to a corner of Europe where lush pastures have become killing fields. They hiked past decimated villages and through muddy trenches. As they got to within 150 yards of the enemy line, the team were warned that Russian forces could hear them. ""They go a little bit forward to see what's going on there and, for example, in May, 2 guys were killed by snipers,"" the president cautioned. The war has cost more than 13,000 lives since it began in 2014. It started after massive popular protests toppled the previous Ukrainian government, which was friendly to Moscow. Russia responded by sending troops to seize control of Crimea — and backing an armed insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Asked by Williams why ordinary Americans, thousands of miles away, should even care what's happening in Ukraine, President Zelenskyy warned that his country's conflict with Russia, ""can be tomorrow in their houses."" ""You're saying if Russia will do this here, it might do it tomorrow in the rest of Europe?"" Williams pressed the president. ""The next day attack America?"" ""Why not? I don't know why not,"" he said. It may sound far-fetched, but experts say Russian hackers are using Ukraine as a testing ground for what's been described as hybrid warfare, which can include attacking power grids and other infrastructure, before using similar tactics against the U.S. and its allies. Earlier this year, tens of thousands of Russian troops massed along Ukraine's border for what Moscow insisted were routine military exercises. The goal, most believe, was to intimidate an American ally with aspirations of joining the NATO alliance, and to deliver a pointed warning to the West that any eastward expansion of the U.S. sphere of influence in Russia's backyard wouldn't be tolerated. But Zelenskyy told CBS News that President Vladimir Putin's intentions go beyond that. He said the Russian leader has imperial ambitions for Russia to re-assert control over smaller neighbors that used to sit firmly under the fold of the Soviet Union. The U.S. has supported Ukraine in its fight against the Russian-backed separatists with money, weapons and training, but Zelenskyy's chief of staff told Williams that what his country really wants is America's backing to join NATO. Inclusion in the alliance would give Ukraine a whole new level of protection from Russia, obligating all NATO allies to defend it collectively in the face of an attack from any foe. ""We hope and believe that our strategic partners, United States, help us and help today, now — not tomorrow, not in one year, not in two years — now, because we need this help now,"" stressed Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak. He reiterated the president's point, stressing that just because the shelling is confined to eastern Ukraine, especially given the new ways in which Russia is wielding its power, no war is guaranteed to stay where it started. ""Somebody believes that the war... which happens in another country never came to their territory? It's the history of the first [world] war, it's the history of the second [world] war,"" said Yermak. ""It means that we need to think about each other, and if you today have the opportunity, have the power, have the influence to stop the war in any place in the world, especially in the center of Europe, it's necessary to do."" ""The distance by kilometers, this can look very long,"" he added. ""By mentality, by modern weapons, it's very short."" In the U.S., however, there are fears that extending NATO membership to Ukraine could exacerbate the already-sky-high tension with Russia, right as President Biden tries to forge a more ""stable and predictable relationship"" with Moscow. President Zelensky told CBS News that Ukraine is holding the eastern line against Russia, and that it deserves more support from its friends as it does so. For him, any new cold war between the world's biggest nuclear powers is secondary to the price his country is paying now, in lives lost. ""Some people say that it's a cold war between Russia and the USA. For us it's not cold war, maybe for these two countries it's cold war, but for us, it's a hot war,"" he told Williams. Few Ukrainians have much hope that the summit between Mr. Biden and Putin will change anything on the bloody battlefield that has literally divided their nation.",4,4.947478727970716,6.221648230346968,-1.2741695023762523,17
2021-06-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/jbs-cyberattack-meat-supplier-fbi-attributes-revil-ransomware-operation-russia-greeley/,FBI Attributes JBS Cyberattack To Russia-Linked 'REvil' Ransomware Operation,"GREELEY, Colo. (CBS4) - The cyberattack that disrupted operations at JBS, the world's largest meat supplier, is now attributed to a Russia-linked ransomware operation. In a statement on Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it is working diligently to bring the threat actors known as ""REvil"" or ""Sodinokibi"" to justice. JBS became aware of the cyberattack on Sunday over Memorial Day weekend. In a statement on Tuesday night, the company said it had made ""significant progress"" in resolving the hack, which disrupted operations at more than a dozen U.S. facilities, including a beef plant in Greeley. JBS officials said the ""vast majority"" of its meatpacking plants would be operational by Wednesday. ""Our systems are coming back online and we are not sparing any resources to fight this threat. We have cybersecurity plans in place to address these types of issues and we are successfully executing those plans,"" stated Andre Nogueira, JBS USA CEO. ""The company is not aware of any evidence at this time that any customer, supplier or employee data has been compromised."" The REvil Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation, also known as Sodinokibi, provides malware kits for criminal affiliates to launch cyberattacks in exchange for a cut of the profit, usually around 20-30%. In October 2020, REvil reportedly invested $1 million in bitcoin to employ new recruits, according to Forbes. In previous operations, REvil has used spearphishing techniques to gain access to systems via malicious attachments, including Microsoft Word documents. It's unclear how the criminal group gained access to servers supporting JBS's North American and Australian IT systems. JBS has not said how much ransom the hackers are demanding and if the company plans to pay. The company's operations in Mexico and the UK were not impacted by the breach. In a tweet on Wednesday, Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican who represents Colorado's 4th Congressional District, urged the Biden administration to hold REvil distributors and affiliates criminally accountable for the attack. IBM Security X-Force reports REvil profited at least $81 million from extortion threats in 2020. Cybersecurity experts say the criminal group appears to consider an organization's annual revenue, with ransom demands ranging from $1,500 to $42 million. ""REvil has been one of those most prolific groups and accounts for about 4% of all ransomware activity. The group has also been responsible for some of the largest ransoms to have become publicly known, including a $42 million demand in the case of entertainment law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks,"" said Brett Callow, a threat analyst with the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. ""Like many other groups, REvil operates an affiliate model. While the people who created the ransomware are believed to be based in Russia, the people who use it to carry out the attacks - the affiliates - could be based anywhere."" The JBS cyberattack comes just weeks after a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline prompted gas shortages in several states. Colonial paid nearly $5 million in ransom to the Russian hacking group DarkSide. Soon after, the extortion gang claimed it was ending its operation before disappearing offline. Some meat industry experts estimate JBS may already be tens of thousands of heads short in their processing due to the ransomware attack.",20,3.3242562710022208,0.9175647318209184,2.4066915391813026,2
2021-06-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jbs-meat-cyberattack-resumes-production/,JBS resumes meat production after weekend cyberattack,"The world's largest meat processing company has resumed most production after a weekend cyberattack, but experts say the vulnerabilities exposed by this attack and others are far from resolved. In a statement late Wednesday, the FBI attributed the attack on Brazil-based meat processor JBS SA to REvil, a Russian-speaking gang that has made some of the largest ransomware demands on record in recent months. The FBI said it will work to bring the group to justice and it urged anyone who is the victim of a cyberattack to contact the bureau immediately. REvil has not posted anything related to the hack on its dark web site. But that's not unusual. Ransomware syndicates as a rule don't post about attacks when they are in initial negotiations with victims — or if the victims have paid a ransom. In October, a REvil representative who goes by the handle ""UNKN"" said in an interview published online that the agriculture sector would now be a main target for the syndicate. REvil also threatened to auction off sensitive stolen data from victims who refused to pay it. The attack targeted servers supporting JBS's operations in North America and Australia. Backup servers weren't affected and the company said it was not aware of any customer, supplier or employee data being compromised. JBS said late Wednesday said that it expects to resume production at all its plants on Thursday and be running at ""close to full capacity"" across its global operations. It is not known if JBS paid a ransom. The company hasn't discussed it in public statements, and did not respond to phone and email messages Wednesday seeking comment. The FBI and the White House declined to comment on the ransom. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday the U.S. is considering all options in dealing with the attack and that President Joe Biden intends to confront Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, about his nation's harboring of ransomware criminals when the two meet in Europe in two weeks. ""I can assure you that we are raising this through the highest levels of the U.S. government,"" she said. ""The president certainly believes that President Putin has a role to play in stopping and preventing these attacks."" While there is no evidence Russia benefits financially from ransomware crime — which has hit health care, education and state and local governments especially hard during the pandemic — U.S. officials say its practitioners have sometimes worked for Kremlin security services. Ransomware expert Allan Liska of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future said JBS was the largest food manufacturer yet to be hit by ransomware, in which criminal hackers paralyze entire networks by scrambling their data. But he said at least 40 food companies have been targeted by ransomware gangs over the last year, including brewer Molson Coors and E & J Gallo Winery. Food companies, Liska said, are at ""about the same level of security as manufacturing and shipping. Which is to say, not very."" The attack was the second in a month on critical U.S. infrastructure. Earlier in May, hackers believed to operate with impunity in Russia and allied states shut down operation of the Colonial Pipeline, the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, for nearly a week. The closure sparked long lines and panic buying at gas stations across the Southeast. Colonial Pipeline confirmed it paid $4.4 million to the hackers, who then turned over a software decryption key. Cybersecurity experts said the attacks targeting critical sectors of the U.S. economy are evidence that industry hasn't been taking years of repeated warnings seriously. Cybercriminals previously active in online ID theft and bank fraud moved into ransomware in the mid-2010s as programmers developed sophisticated programs that permitted the software's more efficient dissemination. The ransomware scourge reached epidemic dimensions last year. The firm CrowdStrike observed over 1,400 ransomware and data extortion incidents in 2020. Most targeted manufacturing, industrials, engineering and technology companies, said Adam Meyers, the company's senior vice president of intelligence. ""The problem has been spiraling out of control,"" said John Hultquist, who heads intelligence analysis at FireEye. ""We're already deep into a vicious cycle."" Hultquist said ransomware syndicates are going after more critical and visible targets because they've invested heavily in identifying ""whales,"" companies they think will yield big ransoms. JBS is the second-largest producer of beef, pork and chicken in the U.S. If it were to shut down for even one day, the U.S. would lose almost a quarter of its beef-processing capacity, or the equivalent of 20,000 beef cows, according to Trey Malone, an assistant professor of agriculture at Michigan State University. Mark Jordan, who follows the meat industry as the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, said the disruption to the food supply will likely be minimal in this case. Meat has around a 14-day window to move through the market, he said. If a plant is closed for a day or two, companies can usually make up for lost production with extra shifts. ""Several plants owned by a major meatpacker going offline for a couple of days is a major headache, but it is manageable assuming it doesn't extend much beyond that,"" he said. Jordan said a closure that runs closer to a week would be more serious, especially for a company like JBS, which controls around one-fifth of the country's beef, pork and chicken supply. Critical U.S. infrastructure might be better hardened against ransomware attacks were it not for the 2012 defeat of legislation that would have set cybersecurity standards for critical industries. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups lobbied hard against the bill, condemning it as government interference in the free market. Even a watered-down version that would have made the standards voluntary was blocked by a Republican filibuster in the Senate. Right now, the U.S. has no cybersecurity requirements for companies outside of the electric, nuclear and banking systems, said David White, president of the cyber risk management company Axio. White said regulations would help, particularly for companies with inadequate or immature cybersecurity programs. Those rules should be sector-specific and should consider the national economic risks of outages, he said. But he said regulations can also have an unintentional negative effect. Some companies might consider them the ceiling — not the starting point — for how they need to manage risk, he said. ""Bottom line: regulation can help, but it is not the panacea,""' White said. JBS plants in Australia resumed limited operations Wednesday in New South Wales and Victoria states, Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said. The company hoped to resume work in Queensland state on Thursday, he said. JBS, which is a majority shareholder of Pilgrim's Pride, didn't say which of its 84 U.S. facilities were closed Monday and Tuesday because of the attack. It said JBS USA and Pilgrim's were able to ship meat from nearly all facilities Tuesday. Several of the company's pork, poultry and prepared foods plants were operational Tuesday and its Canada beef facility resumed production, it said.

2021-05-31,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-military-units-nato/,Russian military to add 20 new units in country's west to counter NATO,"Russia's military will form 20 new units in the country's west this year to counter what it claims is a growing threat from NATO, the defense minister said Monday. Sergei Shoigu made the announcement at a meeting with top military officials. He pointed to a growing number of flights by U.S. strategic bombers near Russia's borders, deployments of NATO warships and increasingly frequent and major drills by alliance forces. He charged that such actions ""destroy the international security system and force us to take the relevant countermeasures."" ""We will form another 20 units and formations in the Western Military District until the year's end,"" Shoigu said. He added the military units in Western Russia have commissioned about 2,000 new pieces of weaponry this year. Asked Monday about Russia's plans, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted that ""Russia over the last years has invested heavily in new, modern military capabilities, from conventional to nuclear weapon systems"" and ""has been willing to use military force against neighbors, in Georgia, in Ukraine."" ""This is one of the main reasons why NATO over the last years has increased the readiness of (its) armed forces,"" he told reporters before Tuesday's meeting of the alliance's foreign and defense ministers. Currently, thousands of NATO troops, several warships and dozens of aircraft are taking part in military exercises stretching across the Atlantic, through Europe and into the Black Sea region. NATO says the war games aren't aimed at Russia, but the Steadfast Defender 21 exercises are simulating the 30-nation military organization's response to an attack on any one of its members. It will test NATO's ability to deploy troops from the U.S. and keep supply lines open. Last month, a troop buildup in Russia's south and southwest near the Ukrainian border raised concerns in Ukraine and the West, which urged Moscow to withdraw its forces. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 following the ouster of the country's Moscow-friendly president and then threw its weight behind separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in seven years of fighting in eastern Ukraine. Russia has recalled some troops from its western part after sweeping maneuvers in April, but Shoigu ordered them to leave their weapons behind for Russia's Zapad (West) 2021 military exercises in September. He noted Monday that preparations for the exercises, which will be conducted jointly with Belarus, are now in their final stage and emphasized that the maneuvers have an ""exclusively defensive character."" Last week, Russia offered political support to its ally Belarus, which diverted a Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania as part of a ruse to arrest a dissident journalist. The European Union denounced the flight's diversion as piracy and responded by barring the Belarusian flag carrier from its airspace and advising European airlines to skirt Belarus' airspace.",4,8.615764348217605,7.090145929841993,1.5256184183756112,17
2021-05-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/tsvetan-kanev-electronics-colorado-russia-commerce-technology-security/,"Bulgarian National Arrested In Germany, Sentenced In Colorado For Illegally Selling Electronics To Russia","DENVER (CBS4) -- Tsvetan Kanev, 49, of Sofia, Bulgaria, was sentenced to two years in federal prison Friday for attempting to sell protected American technology to Russia's space and military programs. Kanev was accused of arranging the purchase of electronic components from a U.S. manufacturer in 2015 that were to be delivered, as Kanev stated, to the Bulgarian Academy of Science. However, the manufacturer became suspicious and contacted federal agents from the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Counter-Proliferation Investigations Center (CPIC) in Colorado Springs. Those agents went undercover and offered to complete the deals with Kanev. They ultimately determined Kanev planned to ship the components to Bulgaria through Finland, but the parts would be re-packaged into a suitcase once in Finland and exported to Russia. According to a press release from the U.S. Attorney General Office's in Denver, Kanev transferred nearly $235,000 into an undercover agent's account in October 2015 to purchase a clock driver and random-access memory programmable multi-chip modules. Three months later, he transferred another $122,000 in order to obtain a multiple analog-to-digital converter. ""The particular technologies he sought are designed for aerospace applications and controlled under U.S. Department of Commerce regulations for national security reasons,"" the press release stated. Kaven routed the payments to avoid scrutiny from banking authorities, fraudulently filled out documents to deceive the U.S. Customs authorities, asked the undercover agents to falsify documentation, and then paid those agents an additional $56,000 for their assumed risk. Kaven also acknowledged to the undercover agents that he knew what he was doing was illegal, according to the press release. All money transferred to the agents was seized and forfeited to the U.S. government. The case sat idle for three and a half years after Kaven's indictment. Then, in January 2020, he was arrested in Germany and extradited to Colorado. Kanev reached a plea agreement with Denver-based federal prosecutors in March. He pleaded guilty to one count of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). In exchange, prosecutors dropped a second such count and a third charge of smuggling goods. The IEEPA has been used by U.S. presidents since 1977 to impose economic sanctions on foreign governments and terrorist organizations, according to a 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service. ""Because a U.S. manufacturer alerted the government to a suspicious foreign inquiry, transfers of American technology to the Russian military and space program were thwarted and this defendant was brought to justice,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Matt Kirsch for the District of Colorado. ""This kind of public-private partnership is key to protecting American technology and national security.""",20,5.890986018029608,3.9049897613820144,1.9859962566475935,12
2021-05-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-cisa-chief-christopher-krebs-biden-order-on-cybersecurity/,"Former CISA chief says Biden order on cybersecurity is ""dramatic game change""","Christopher Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security, praised the Biden administration for taking action to address cybersecurity threats. Krebs spoke with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett for this week's episode of ""The Takeout"" podcast. President Biden signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at hardening the federal government's cybersecurity defenses by directing the Commerce Department to author new standards for software vendors supplying the federal government. Krebs called the action a ""dramatic game change"" that showed Mr. Biden's ""committed leadership vision"" to prioritize cybersecurity concerns. Highlights from this week's episode: ""It dramatically increases security expectations of the software products that are sold to the federal government,"" Krebs said, explaining that this would have a ""cascading effect"" for products sold to ordinary American customers. Krebs praised Mr. Biden for ""jettisoning the traditional approach"" to addressing cybersecurity, but said that Congress needed to act to shore up the nation's cyber infrastructure as well. Krebs has previously called on Mr. Biden to incorporate this into his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal. ""You need both,"" Krebs said, meaning presidential and congressional action. Krebs also responded to the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, after the company announced Wednesday that it has begun restarting pipeline operations after a cyberattack forced the company to take some of its systems offline last Friday. ""Ransomware is a really, really profitable business these days,"" Krebs remarked. The company, which operates a major energy pipeline, first announced the hack a week ago, also soon disclosed that ""this incident involves ransomware."" Several sources told CBS News on Thursday that Colonial Pipeline did pay a ransom to the hackers who had infiltrated its computer network. The money was paid shortly after the computer systems started locking up late last week. The FBI said Monday that the attack was the work of a criminal gang known as DarkSide, an operation which Krebs said was composed mainly of Russian individuals, many in their teens or early twenties. Colonial Pipeline said an outside security firm is investigating the incident. Krebs said that DarkSide not only holds data for ransom, but exfiltrates it as well, calling the operation ""fifth-dimension chess here from a criminal perspective."" Mr. Biden said Thursday that there's no evidence that the Russian government was involved in the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, although U.S. intelligence suggests the hackers live in Russia. Krebs said that he had ""a hard time seeing how it would be possible"" for DarkSide to operate without Russian domestic intelligence having knowledge of their actions. ""There are prior examples of ransomware crews coordinating and collaborating with Russian intelligence,"" Krebs said. The decision to take the company's systems offline led to long lines in some states this week, as gas prices in some areas hit a nearly seven-year high, and gas stations in several states were plagued by long lines and many ran out of gasoline. The 5,500-mile pipeline supplies about 45% of the East Coast's fuel. Krebs also discussed the SolarWinds hack last year, an intrusion that initially gave cyber criminals access to 18,000 government and private computer networks, though a much smaller number were the actual targets of espionage. The National Security Agency, FBI and CISA have formally attributed the attack to Russia, saying the country's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, directed the intrusions. The Biden administration recently issued sanctions on Russia in part in response to the SolarWinds intrusion. Krebs, whose cybersecurity consultant firm is working with SolarWinds, said that ""there are plenty of lessons learned that everyone can take"" from the intrusion. ""Everybody can do better. The threats are so diverse right now,"" Krebs said. He added that there were many businesses that needed to improve their ""corporate citizenship"" by upping their cybersecurity practices. Krebs was fired by former President Trump in November after he continued to debunk the president's false claims that the election was stolen from him.

2021-05-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-colonial-pipeline-cyberattack-defense-live-stream-2021-05-13/,Biden urges calm as Colonial Pipeline comes back online,"Washington — President Biden said on Thursday that Americans should soon begin to see the effects of the Colonial Pipeline coming back online, as the company restarts operations after a cyberattack forced its systems offline last week. The halt in pipeline operations has left many gas stations without gas in the Southeast, and often long lines in the stations that do have gas. ""They should be reaching full operational capacity as we speak, as I speak to you right now. That is good news,"" the president said. ""But I want to be clear. You will not feel the affects at the pump immediately. This is not like flicking on a light switch."" Mr. Biden noted that there are 5,000 miles of pipeline to bring back online, and said a return to normalcy could stretch into next week. He urged Americans not to panic, acknowledging that it's stressful to see gas stations without gasoline. He also urged gas stations not to gouge prices. ""Do not get more gas than you need in the next few days,"" Mr. Biden said. ""As I said, we expect the situation to begin to improve by the weekend and into early next week, and gasoline supply is getting back online, and panic buying will only slow the process."" The ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, which was announced by the company on Friday, is the latest cybersecurity crisis confronting the Biden administration, following a sweeping cyber espionage campaign attributed to Russia that impacted nine federal agencies and 100 private companies, as well as a Chinese-linked Microsoft Exchange breach that affected scores of businesses nationwide. Mr. Biden said there's no evidence that the Russian government was involved in the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, although U.S. intelligence points to the hackers living in Russia. That comment was met with immediate criticism from Russia hawks. Asked if he's confident Russian President Vladimir Putin wasn't involved, the president responded: ""I am confident that I've read the report of the FBI accurately. And they say they were not, he was not, the government was not."" The FBI on Monday identified the criminal gang known as DarkSide as behind the attack. Mr. Biden said he is not ruling out retaliatory cyberattacks to shut down the perpetrators of the Colonial Pipeline attack. The president declined to comment Thursday on a report from Bloomberg that Colonial Pipeline paid the hackers a $5 million ransom. White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated at the White House press briefing that ""it continues to be the position of the federal government, the FBI, that it is not in the interests of the private sector for companies to pay ransom because it incentivizes these actions."" In the face of the growing cyber threat, Mr. Biden took unilateral action Wednesday with an executive order aimed at shoring up the federal government's cybersecurity defenses. While the order does not address critical infrastructure, it calls for the Commerce Department to craft new standards for software vendors working with the federal government and establishes a ""Cybersecurity Safety Review Board,"" composed of people from the public and private sectors. The ransomware attack that hit Colonial Pipeline forced the company to shut down all 5,500 miles of its pipeline, which supplies 45% of the East Coast's fuel. While the Biden administration eased regulations to avoid fuel supply disruptions as part of an ""all-hands on deck"" approach, the cyberattack still led to long gas lines as residents feared fuel shortages. Numerous agencies across the federal government, including the Departments of Transportation and Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency, took steps to boost the gas supply in affected states. On Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas approved a temporary waiver to the Jones Act to an individual company to ease oil supply constraints related to the Colonial Pipeline incident. After Colonial Pipeline announced Wednesday evening it initiated a restart of pipeline operations, Psaki said in a statement that ""there's an end in sight."" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted Thursday morning that the restart of the pipeline ""went well,"" and predicted a return to normalcy by the end of the weekend, while the company said it has ""made substantial progress"" in restarting its pipeline system. ""This is a whole of government response to get more fuel more quickly to where it's needed and to limit the pain being felt by American customers,"" Mr. Biden said.",20,1.7806574970098417,0.523550218926415,1.2571072780834267,13
2021-05-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/dfw/news/colonial-pipeline-cyberattack-service-weekend-oil-prices/,After Cyberattack Pipeline Officials Hope To Have Service Back By The Weekend -- But Oil Prices Fall,"WASHINGTON (CBSDFW.COM/AP) — The operator of a major U.S. fuel pipeline -- that runs from Texas to the northeast -- said it hopes to have services mostly restored by the end of the week after a massive cyberattack. The FBI and administration officials have identified the culprits as a gang of criminal hackers. U.S. officials sought to soothe concerns about price spikes or damage to the economy by stressing that the fuel supply had so far not experienced widespread disruptions, and the company said Monday that it was working toward ""substantially restoring operational service"" by the weekend. The White House said in a statement late Monday that it was monitoring supply shortages in parts of the Southeast and that President Joe Biden had directed federal agencies to bring their resources to bear. Colonial Pipeline halted operations last week after revealing a ransomware attack that it said had affected some of its systems. Nonetheless, the attack underscored the vulnerabilities of the nation's energy sector and other critical industries whose infrastructure is largely privately owned. Ransomware attacks are typically carried out by criminal hackers who scramble data, paralyzing victim networks, and demand large payments to decrypt it. The Colonial attack was a potent reminder of the real-world implications of the burgeoning threat. Even as the Biden administration works to confront organized hacking campaigns sponsored by foreign governments, it must still contend with difficult-to-prevent attacks from cybercriminals. ""We need to invest to safeguard our critical infrastructure,"" Biden said Monday. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the attack ""tells you how utterly vulnerable we are"" to cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure. The attack came as the administration, still grappling with its response to massive breaches by Russia of federal agencies and private corporations, works on an executive order aimed at bolstering cybersecurity defenses. The Justice Department, meanwhile, has formed a ransomware task force designed for situations just like Colonial Pipeline, and the Energy Department on April 20 announced a 100-day initiative focused on protecting energy infrastructure from cyber threats. Similar actions are planned for other critical industries, such as water and natural gas. Despite that, the challenge facing the government and the private sector remains immense. In this case, the FBI publicly assigned blame Monday by saying the criminal syndicate whose ransomware was used in the attack is named DarkSide. The group's members are Russian speakers, and the syndicate's malware is coded not to attack networks using Russian-language keyboards. Russia, however, denied any involvement in the attack. Anne Neuberger, the White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said at a briefing that the group has been on the FBI's radar for months. She said its business model is to demand ransom payments from victims and then split the proceeds with the ransomware developers, relying on what she said was a ""new and very troubling variant."" She declined to say if Colonial Pipeline had paid any ransom, and the company has not given any indication of that one way or the other. Though the FBI has historically discouraged victims from making payments for fear of promoting additional attacks, she acknowledged ""the very difficult"" situation that victims face and said the administration needs to look ""thoughtfully at this area"" of how best to deter ransomware. ""Given the rise in ransomware, that is one area we're definitely looking at now to say, 'What should be the government's approach to ransomware actors and to ransoms overall?'"" Speaking later in the day at a conference on national security, Neuberger said the administration was committed to leveraging the government's massive buying power to ensure that software makers make their products less vulnerable to hackers. ""Security can't be an afterthought,"" Neuberger said. ""We don't buy a car and only then decide if we want to pay for seatbelts and airbags."" The U.S. sanctioned the Kremlin last month for a hack of federal government agencies, known as the SolarWinds breach, that officials have linked to a Russian intelligence unit and characterized as an intelligence-gathering operation. In this case, though, the hackers are not known to be working at the behest of any foreign government. The group posted a statement on its dark web site describing itself as apolitical. ""Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society,"" DarkSide said. Asked Monday whether Russia was involved, Biden said, """"I'm going to be meeting with President (Vladimir) Putin, and so far there is no evidence based on, from our intelligence people, that Russia is involved, although there is evidence that the actors, ransomware, is in Russia. ""They have some responsibility to deal with this,"" he added. The Kremlin on Tuesday rejected any suggestion it was involved in the attack. ""Russia has nothing to do with these hacking attacks. Russia didn't have anything to do with hacking attacks that had taken place earlier,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said during a conference call with reporters. ""We categorically don't accept any accusations against us in this regard."" U.S. officials have sought to head off anxieties about the prospect of a lingering economic impact and disruption to the fuel supply, especially given Colonial Pipeline's key role in transporting gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and other petroleum products between Texas and the East Coast. Colonial is restarting portions of its network. It said Monday that it was evaluating the product inventory in storage tanks at its facilities. Administration officials stressed that Colonial proactively took some of its systems offline to prevent the ransomware from migrating from business computer systems to those that control and operate the pipeline. In response to the attack, the administration loosened regulations for the transport of petroleum products on highways as part of an ""all-hands-on-deck"" effort to avoid disruptions in the fuel supply. ""The time of the outage is now approaching critical levels and if it continues to remain down we do expect an increase in East Coast gasoline and diesel prices,"" said Debnil Chowdhury, IHS Markit Executive Director. The last time there was an outage of this magnitude was in 2016, he said, when gas prices rose 15 to 20 cents per gallon. The Northeast had significantly more local refining capacity at that time. The pipeline utilizes both common and custom technology systems, which could complicate efforts to bring the entire network back online, according to analysts at Third Bridge. Granholm, the Energy secretary, said ""Cyber attacks on our critical infrastructure — especially energy infrastructure — is not going away."" ""This is a serious example of what we're seeing across the board in many places and it tells you that we need to invest in our systems, our transmission grid for electricity. We need to invest in cyber defense in these energy systems,"" she told Bloomberg TV. The attack has not affected the supply of gasoline, she said, ""but if it goes on too long, of course that will change.″ Gasoline futures ticked higher Monday. Futures for crude and fuel, prices that traders pay for contracts for delivery in the future, typically begin to rise anyway each year as the driving season approaches. The price you pay at the pump tends to follow. The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline has jumped 6 cents over the past two weeks, to $3.02 per gallon, which is $1.05 higher than a year ago. The year-ago numbers are skewed somewhat because the nation was going into lockdown due to the pandemic. The attack on the Colonial Pipeline could exacerbate the upward pressure on prices if it is unresolved for a period of time. (© Copyright 2021 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

2021-05-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/colonial-pipeline-cyberattack-kemp-suspends-gas-tax/,Colonial Pipeline Cyberattack: Gov. Kemp Temporarily Suspends Gas Tax,"ATLANTA, Ga. (CW69 News at 10/CNN) – Following a ransomware attack that took a major east coast pipeline that runs through Atlanta offline, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed an executive order temporarily suspending the state gas tax. A top federal energy regulator is calling on energy CEOs to step up their cyber defenses. Considering the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed an executive order temporarily suspending the gas tax in Georgia. Kemp said, ""Unfortunately, extensive media coverage has caused people to panic which has resulted in higher gas prices. We are taking action to relieve some of the cost burden from Georgians as Colonial recovers by suspending fuel taxes, increasing the weight limit for supply trucks, and prohibiting price gouging."" ""This is a real wake up call,"" Neil Chatterjee, a commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, told CNN Business in an exclusive interview Monday. Alpharetta based Colonial Pipeline, which delivers nearly half of the diesel and gasoline consumed on the East Coast, shut down Friday following the cyberattack. The supply disruption is raising the specter of $3 a gallon gasoline in the United States for the first time since 2014. ""Every CEO in the energy sector — and especially pipeline CEOs — should immediately convene their incident management teams to do a deep dive review of their security posture and protocols,"" Chatterjee said. The incident underscores just how vulnerable the nation's critical infrastructure is to cyberattacks. ""These pipelines are now, in many ways, on the frontlines of our national defense,"" said Chatterjee, a Republican who previously chaired FERC, which regulates the power grid and evaluates pipeline applications. (The Transportation Safety Administration regulates pipeline safety.) 'Red alert' for Washington A criminal group originating from Russia named ""DarkSide"" is believed to be responsible for the attack on the Colonial Pipeline, the largest refined products pipeline in the United States. The FBI confirmed Monday that DarkSide ransomware was used in the attack. ""The United States government at its highest levels needs to be firm and clear that we will not tolerate nation states like Russia harboring ransomware teams. And we will defend our national interests,"" Chatterjee said. Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments, said the latest hack should be a ""red alert"" for the White House following years of hackers blackmailing local governments, businesses, and hospitals. ""This lucrative enterprise has emboldened criminals, but the response from Washington has been glacial, even as far more sophisticated hacks increase from countries like Russia and China,"" Valliere wrote in a note to clients Monday. The White House formed an inter-agency working group over the weekend to discuss scenarios and plan for next steps. A person familiar with the matter told CNN's Kevin Liptak that the Biden administration is finalizing an executive order to better respond and defend against major cyberattacks. Prolonged shutdown could cause 'widespread' fuel shortages It would be hard to find a larger target than the Colonial Pipeline, which transports more than 100 million gallons of fuel daily from the US Gulf Coast to the East Coast. ""I can't emphasize enough how critical it is,"" Chatterjee said of the pipeline. The worry is that a prolonged shutdown will leave drivers and airports without the fuel they need — just as the US economy reopens from the pandemic. ""Depending on the duration, the supply shock could leave the region with widespread fuel shortages,"" Michael Tran, RBC Capital's director of global energy strategy, wrote in a note to clients. That would be on top of various shortages impacting the US economy, including computer chips, steel, lumber and even workers. The Colonial Pipeline Company, a privately held firm based in Alpharetta, Georgia, said Sunday it is developing a system restart plan. The company said its four main pipelines remain offline, but some smaller ones between terminals and delivery points are now operational. ""Our primary focus continues to be the safe and efficient restoration of service to our pipeline system, while minimizing disruption to our customers and all those who rely on Colonial Pipeline,"" the company said in a statement. The White House said Monday there are no issues with fuel supply, and the Biden administration is working closely with Colonial Pipeline to mitigate the effects of the ransomware attack and subsequent shutdown of the pipeline. Ready for the next attack? The attack is just the latest surprise event to disrupt a key part of the world's energy infrastructure. In 2019, an attack on Saudi Aramco caused a severe outage that briefly sent oil prices skyrocketing. Earlier this year, a deadly blackout gripped Texas after freezing temperatures knocked offline natural gas, coal and wind facilities. The Colonial Pipeline shutdown also raises questions about the cyber preparedness of the facility and the energy industry at large. The pipeline, whose owners include Royal Dutch Shell and Koch Industries, said it ""proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat"" and immediately hired third-party cyber experts to launch an investigation. ""They worked quickly to try and maintain operational security,"" Chatterjee said. ""But clearly the fact that such a critical pipeline has come offline is of concern to everyone."" Asked if the federal government is doing enough to protect against cyber threats, Chatterjee said, ""We can always do better."" And he emphasized that the standards set by regulators need to be the floor, not the ceiling, when it comes to cyber defenses. ""Our adversaries are sophisticated and are consistently evolving and continually evolving their tactics and methods and approaches,"" Chatterjee said. ""And we need to do the same."" ©2021 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved. CNN contributed to the story.",20,0.6660141637557415,5.509001954599945,-4.842987790844203,13
2021-04-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/intelligence-community-foreign-malign-influence/,U.S. intelligence community to create center to address foreign malign influence,"The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) will establish a new center tasked with tracking overseas efforts to wage disinformation and influence campaigns in the U.S., a spokesperson said Monday. The Foreign Malign Influence Center will focus on ""coordinating and integrating intelligence pertaining to malign influence, drawing together relevant and diverse expertise to better understand and monitor the challenge,"" the ODNI spokesman said in a statement. The official said that plans for the center arose in response to congressional demands and in light of ""evolving threats."" While foreign efforts to interfere in U.S. elections are not a new phenomenon, Russia, at President Vladimir Putin's direction, in 2016 waged a sweeping, multiprong campaign designed to denigrate the candidacy of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and boost the chances of then-candidate Donald Trump. Moscow again targeted the U.S. midterm elections in 2018 and the 2020 presidential election, according to statements and assessments from U.S. intelligence officials. Other actors, including Iran, are since known to have carried out similarly targeted, covert campaigns to undermine public confidence in the country's democratic processes. An ODNI assessment of threats to the 2020 election said the intelligence community tracked ""a broader array for foreign actors taking steps to influence U.S. elections than in past election cycles."" But U.S. intelligence officials have warned consistently that foreign efforts to sow discord and spread disinformation will not be limited to election cycles, and are instead likely to represent a new normal. Two intelligence forecasts released this year warned that foreign disinformation efforts targeting the U.S. were likely to continue and that new technologies could exacerbate them. ""Emerging and disruptive technologies, as well as the proliferation and permeation of technology in all aspects of our lives, pose unique challenges,"" the intelligence community's 2021 worldwide threat assessment said. ""Cyber capabilities, to illustrate, are demonstrably intertwined with threats to our infrastructure and to the foreign malign influence threats against our democracy."" A longer-term threat forecast released by the National Intelligence Council said manufactured or synthetic media could, in the coming decades, ""further distort truth and reality, destabilizing societies at a scale and speed that dwarfs current disinformation challenges."" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee earlier this month that countering foreign influence operations was a ""critical issue"" for the intelligence community. A committee official said reviews of the most effective structure and size for the center were still ""in progress."" ODNI did not offer a timeline for the center's official launch. Politico first reported plans for its creation. Last year's Intelligence Authorization Act required ODNI to establish a body specifically tasked with coordinating intelligence from across the 18-member community on hostile foreign influence campaigns from the likes of Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, and providing policymakers with relevant assessments. ""I believed this provision was critical to the effort to coordinate our response to the disturbing increase in foreign influence by hostile actors, and the recently released Intelligence Community Assessment on foreign interference in the 2020 election demonstrates why this remains an urgent priority,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said in a statement. ""I know that Director Haines considers the assimilation of this intelligence a critical need, and I look forward to working with her to ensure we can accomplish the mission Congress intended,"" Schiff said. ""While the [intelligence community] has dramatically improved its game since 2016, it makes sense to have one location within it to integrate all of the various threat streams in one place,"" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said.",20,4.991739872617231,6.899702061732195,-1.907962189114964,29
2021-04-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-crimea-border-exercises-over-troops-ordered-back-to-base/,Russian defense chief orders troops to return to bases after huge exercises near Ukraine,"Moscow — Russia's defense minister on Thursday ordered troops back to their permanent bases following massive drills in Crimea that involved dozens of navy ships, hundreds of warplanes and thousands of troops in a show of force amid tensions with Ukraine. After watching the drills, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared the maneuvers over and ordered the military to pull the troops taking part in maneuvers in Crimea and western Russia back to their permanent bases. ""I consider the goals of the snap check of readiness fulfilled,"" Shoigu said. ""The troops have shown their defense capability and I decided to complete the drills in the South and Western military districts."" Shoigu said the troops should return to their bases by May 1, but he also ordered to keep the heavy weapons deployed to western Russia as part of the drills for another massive military exercise later this year. Shoigu said they should remain at the Pogorovo firing range in the southwestern Voronezh region. The sprawling range is located about 100 miles east of the border with Ukraine. The Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that came amid increasing violations of a cease-fire in Ukraine's east has raised concerns in the West, which urged the Kremlin to pull its forces back. The Russian military hasn't reported the number of additional troops that have been moved to Crimea and parts of southwestern Russia near Ukraine, and it wasn't immediately clear from Shoigu's statement if all of them will now be pulled back. The U.S. and NATO has said that the Russian buildup near Ukraine was the largest since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and threw its support behind separatists in eastern Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry said the maneuvers in Crimea involved more than 60 ships, over 10,000 troops, around 200 aircraft and about 1,200 military vehicles. The exercise featured the landing of more than 2,000 paratroopers and 60 military vehicles on Thursday. Fighter jets covered the airborne operation. Shoigu flew in a helicopter over the Opuk firing range in Crimea to oversee the exercise. He later declared the drills over, but ordered the military to stand ready to respond to any ""adverse developments"" during NATO's Defender Europe 2021 exercise. Last week, Russia announced that it would close broad areas of the Black Sea near Crimea to foreign navy ships and state vessels until November, a move that drew Ukrainian protests and raised Western concerns. Russia also announced restrictions on flights near Crimea this week, arguing that they fully conform with the international law. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned Tuesday that the Russian buildup across the border was continuing and ""expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops"" in about a week. He urged the West to beef up sanctions against Moscow. Moscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the buildup, arguing that it's free to deploy its forces anywhere on Russian territory and insisting they don't threaten anyone. But at the same time, the Kremlin sternly warned Ukrainian authorities against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel east, where seven years of fighting have killed more than 14,000, saying that Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region. Amid the tensions, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday signed a law allowing the call-up of reservists for military service without announcing a mobilization. The new law will allow to quickly equip the military with reservists, ""significantly increasing their combat effectiveness during military aggression,"" Zelenskyy's office said in a statement.",4,6.598318267348759,2.0947349028248845,4.503583364523875,17

In a clear sign of cooling relations, the United States' ambassador in Moscow confirmed he was leaving the country for ""consultations"" back in the U.S. Over 20 Russian vessels took part in the latest exercises along with Su-25SM3 attack aircraft, as part of a check of the fleet's forces, Russia's Black Sea Fleet said on Tuesday. Russia also announced that it was closing the airspace over parts of Crimea and the Black Sea, saying the areas had been ""declared temporarily dangerous for aircraft flights,"" Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday, citing an official notice sent to pilots. Over 100,000 Russian forces have massed on Ukraine's border and in Crimea, the office of European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said after a briefing by Ukraine's foreign minister. Crimea is the peninsula that was unilaterally annexed away from Ukraine by President Vladimir Putin in 2014. His government now considers it Russian territory, and while the U.S. and Europe have refused to acknowledge the takeover, the Russian military has firm control over the outcrop of land in the Black Sea. ""It's the highest military deployment of Russian army in Ukrainian borders ever,"" said Borrell. He initially said Russia had massed over 150,000 troops in the region, but his comments were later corrected without elaboration. The Maxar satellite imagery company provided almost a dozen images on Tuesday that it said showed increased movements and an influx of Russian military hardware at numerous locations in Crimea, Ukraine, and near the shared border over the past several weeks. The buildup has come amid a spike in hostilities in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been locked in a simmering war with Ukraine's U.S. and European-backed military since 2014. The increase in the violence in eastern Ukraine has raised fears internationally of a possible flareup in the so-called frozen conflict. While U.S. military officials haven't seen anything yet to suggest Russia is gearing up for an imminent cross-border incursion into Ukraine, the United States, the U.K. and European states have criticized Moscow for the military buildup. The Kremlin has shrugged off all calls to withdraw the troops and hardware, saying Russian forces are free to move about Russian territory as they see fit, and to respond to what Moscow calls ""provocative"" moves by the NATO alliance near its borders. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Moscow was not responsible for the soaring tension. He called on other countries to refrain from ""mass anti-Russian psychosis."" Last week, Russia's Defense Ministry said it had closed off navigation in parts of the Black Sea to foreign military and other official vessels from mid-April until the end of October. The move was condemned by the West. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price called it ""yet another unprovoked escalation in Moscow's ongoing campaign to undermine and destabilize Ukraine,"" and ""particularly troubling amid credible reports of Russian troop buildup in occupied Crimea and around Ukraine's borders."" Two British warships were to set sail for the Black Sea in May, The Sunday Times newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing senior U.K. naval sources. The deployment is meant to show solidarity with Ukraine and Britain's NATO allies, the newspaper reported. According to the report, one Type 45 destroyer armed with anti-aircraft missiles and an anti-submarine Type 23 frigate will detach from the Royal Navy's carrier task group in the Mediterranean and sail through the Bosphorus into the Black Sea. RAF F-35B Lightning stealth jets and Merlin submarine-hunting helicopters will stand ready on the task group's flagship, the carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, the newspaper said. Turkey's government announced last week that the U.S. was planning to deploy two warships to the Black Sea, but then later said the Pentagon had cancelled the deployment. U.S. officials never confirmed nor denied that the deployment had been ordered, but a Pentagon spokesman noted that U.S. vessels have operated previously in the international waters of the Black Sea. U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan said he would travel back to Washington this week for consultations after Russia's Foreign Ministry suggested he do so amid a diplomatic crisis between the two countries. ""I believe it is important for me to speak directly with my new colleagues in the Biden administration in Washington about the current state of bilateral relations between the United States and Russia,"" he said in remarks published by the embassy in Moscow. Sullivan, a Trump appointee, said he intended to come back to Moscow in the coming weeks, before any meeting between Presidents Biden and Putin. His departure follows Russia's response to the latest round of U.S. sanctions, announced last week, which included the expulsion of 10 American diplomats from Russia and a ban on the U.S. Embassy hiring any Russian nationals as staff. Russia's Ambassador to the U.S. has been back in Moscow for a month, after being recalled by the Foreign Ministry for consultations.",4,3.3200654498762576,2.707599927722968,0.6124655221532898,7

Among the officials Moscow is banning are Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, FBI Director Chris Wray, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Director of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, director of the U.S Domestic Policy Council Susan Rice and director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons Michael Carvajal, according to a statement released by the Russian Foreign Ministry. The list also includes U.S. officials who have left government – former President Trump's national security advisor, John Bolton, and former director of Central Intelligence R. James Woolsey, who served in the Clinton administration. Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said at a press conference that Moscow would also place restrictions on the activities of U.S. non-governmental organizations on its territory, calling Washington's measures ""hostile"" and ""unprovoked."" The relatively measured response, however, suggested Russia was heeding President Biden's repeated appeals to forestall ""a cycle of escalation and conflict."" In public remarks at the White House on Thursday, President Biden said he ""chose to be proportionate"" in an effort to forge a ""stable and predictable"" relationship with Moscow. Mr. Biden said he told the Russian president that their direct communication was ""essential,"" and proposed an in-person summit in a European country this summer. ""Our teams are discussing that possibility right now,"" Mr. Biden said. Rice responded to the impending Russia ban against her with a tweet Saturday. On Thursday the administration announced economic sanctions on 32 individuals and entities in response to Russian actions it said were ""against U.S. sovereignty and interests,"" including Moscow's interference in the 2020 presidential election. It expelled 10 Russian officials from Washington, D.C., formally attributed the SolarWinds espionage campaign to the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service, and announced a bolstered cyber defense partnership with Western allies. In public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, U.S. intelligence officials said that Russia had likely been expecting a response. Haines testified that there would ""probably be a certain amount of tit for tat,"" but said the intelligence community had assessed that Moscow did not want direct conflict with the U.S. Lt. General Scott Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified that Russia's build-up of military troops along the Ukrainian border and in Crimea had given Moscow the ability to conduct a limited attack, though its intentions remained unclear. ""They have placed themselves in a posture where it's given them options,"" he said. ""If they choose to retaliate in any way, they have a number of different force arrays in Crimea and Ukraine where they could lash out and do something as a message to the Ukraine to the United States or to the NATO alliance.""",20,4.545233033836373,2.016477859021188,2.5287551748151853,18
2021-04-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-sanctions-us-biden-plans/,Biden announces sweeping new sanctions against Russia,"Washington — The Biden administration issued a wide range of sanctions against Russia on Thursday in retaliation for recent incursions including the SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign and Moscow's interference in the 2020 presidential election. ""We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,"" President Biden said in remarks announcing the sanctions on Thursday. He said he ""was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further,"" and that wanted a ""stable, predictable relationship"" with Russia. ""Now is the time to de-escalate,"" Mr. Biden said. ""Where there's an interest for the United States to work with Russia, we should and we will."" However, Mr. Biden was clear that any acts of aggression by Russia would be met with a proportional response. The president said that U.S. officials were working with Russian officials to possibly set up a summit with Mr. Biden and Putin in a third location. The sanctions target more than 30 Russian entities and include the expulsion of at least 10 Russian individuals from the U.S., including intelligence officials and diplomats. The administration also issued an executive order barring U.S. financial institutions from purchasing ruble-denominated bonds beginning in June of 2021, according to a White House fact sheet. ""The Biden administration has been clear that the United States desires a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable,"" the White House said. ""We do not think that we need to continue on a negative trajectory. However, we have also been clear — publicly and privately — that we will defend our national interests and impose costs for Russian Government actions that seek to harm us."" Administration officials have vowed for weeks to exact costs from Moscow. In a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, President Biden said the U.S. would ""act firmly"" in defense of its national interests while proposing a summit with the Russian leader to discuss a ""full range of issues."" The White House also said it was responding to reports that Russia encouraged Taliban fighters to injure or kill coalition forces in Afghanistan. ""Given the sensitivity of this matter, which involves the safety and well-being of our forces, it is being handled through diplomatic, military and intelligence channels,"" the White House statement said. Reports of the alleged bounties on U.S. troops prompted many questions and criticisms of the last administration about what former President Donald Trump knew and how he would respond. But the White House last year said that Mr. Trump wasn't briefed on the reported intelligence because it had not been verified. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday the intelligence community assessed with ""low to moderate confidence"" that Russian intelligence officers sought to encourage attacks on U.S. and coalition forces by the Taliban in Afghanistan, in part because the intelligence relied on detainee reporting and due to the ""challenging operating environment in Afghanistan."" ""We felt the reports were enough of a cause of concern that we wanted the intelligence community to look into those reports as a part of this overall assessment,"" she said. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday that during their call, Mr. Biden informed Putin the U.S. was about to respond to cyber intrusions and election interference by Russia. Sullivan summarized Mr. Biden's comments to Putin as, ""He said, 'I told you that I was going to look into this, I made a determination that Russia has, in fact, conducted these actions. And I'm a man of my word, I am going to respond. But I'm not looking to escalate, I'm looking to provide proportionate responses. And I believe that it is in our interest to find a stable and predictable way forward in this relationship.'"" According to an unclassified report from the U.S. intelligence community, Putin authorized influence campaigns aimed at hurting Mr. Biden's candidacy during the 2020 election and boost former President Donald Trump. ""A key element of Moscow's strategy this election cycle was its use of proxies linked to Russian intelligence to push influence narratives — including misleading or unsubstantiated allegations against President Biden — to U.S. media organizations, U.S. officials, and prominent U.S. individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration,"" the declassified report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated. Last year, cybersecurity researchers identified a hack of a piece of software called SolarWinds — an intrusion that initially gave cyber criminals access to 18,000 government and private computer networks, though a much smaller number were the actual targets of espionage, according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Hackers gained access to digital files of several U.S. government agencies, including the Treasury, Justice and State Departments. The National Security Agency, FBI and CISA formally attributed the attack to Russia on Thursday, saying the country's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, directed the intrusions. A joint advisory from the agencies identified five vulnerabilities that the SVR exploited to carry out the attack. Microsoft President Brad Smith in February told ""60 Minutes"" that the SolarWinds hack was ""the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen."" The U.S. has also publicly warned Russia against aggressive actions in Ukraine. Russia has amassed more than 40,000 troops on Ukraine's eastern border, and more than 40,000 in Crimea, the region that Putin annexed away from Ukraine and declared Russian in 2014. On Wednesday, at a meeting in Brussels with NATO allies, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is ""deeply concerned about what we're seeing, about Russia's ongoing aggressive actions, rhetoric directed at Ukraine."" Top intelligence officials on Wednesday told a Senate panel that Russia would continue to employ ""a variety of tactics"" to undermine the U.S., including mercenary operations, assassinations, arms sales, cyber capabilities and malign influence campaigns — but that Moscow did not seek military conflict.

The U.S. Secretary of State, meeting with Ukrainian and NATO officials in Brussels, made it clear that the Biden administration, along with its allies in Europe, has Ukraine's back and considers Russia's ongoing military buildup in the region ""very provocative."" The Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Friday that Washington had informed Ankara that two U.S. warships would pass through Turkish waters this week to be deployed in the Black Sea. The deployment would come amid a significant escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine's forces, which have U.S. and European support. Hostilities first flared in 2014 when Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea — a peninsula that sticks out into the Black Sea and is home to a Russian navy base — away from Ukraine, drawing condemnation from the Western world and a series of sanctions. Russian Deputy Foreign Ministry Sergei Ryabkov was cited by Russian news agencies on Tuesday as calling the deployment of U.S. warships in the Black Sea a provocation designed to test Russia's nerves. ""There is absolutely nothing for American ships to be doing near our shores,"" Ryabkov said, warning there was a very high risk of unspecified incidents if U.S. military hardware were to be positioned in the Black Sea. ""We warn the United States that it will be better for them to stay far away from Crimea and our Black Sea coast,"" Ryabkov was quoted as saying. ""It will be for their own good."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby declined during a regular press briefing on Friday to confirm the Turkish government's statement that U.S. warships were being sent to the Black Sea. He noted that the U.S. ""routinely"" operates in the Black Sea, but said he wouldn't ""speak to operations."" The current escalation has added strain to already tense U.S.-Russian relations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Russia against aggressive actions in an interview aired over the weekend, saying any aggression in Ukraine would have consequences. Ryabkov responded on Tuesday, accusing the Russian ""adversary"" of trying to undermine Russia's position on the international stage. He reiterated Russia's readiness to defend the interests of its citizens, and ethnic Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing itself in the event any new sanctions should be imposed on Moscow by the U.S. or its global partners. Meanwhile, Russia has continued to move forces into both Crimea and the region along its border with Ukraine. The Defense Ministry reported on Tuesday that 15 warships and vessels of the Caspian Flotilla had been sent to the Black Sea as part of previously announced military exercises. Ukraine said earlier this week that Russia had already massed more than 40,000 troops along its border, and at least 40,000 more in Crimea. Russia says the troop buildup is part of exercises, and has stressed that its forces will go where they want, when they want on Russian territory. Top U.S. officials are in Europe this week, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Blinken. Austin announced during a stop in Germany on Tuesday that the U.S. was going to deploy an additional 500 troops to that country. When asked if the move was meant as a message to Russia, he said it was ""a sign to NATO"" of the U.S. commitment to the transatlantic alliance, and of the firm commitment to Germany. Under President Donald Trump, Washington said it would withdraw thousands of the American forces who've been stationed in Germany for decades. That decision was suspended by the Biden administration, and now the force is set to grow. Blinken, meanwhile, was in Brussels, meeting NATO partners, and he met separately with his Ukrainian counterpart to discuss the standoff with Russia. ""The United States stands firmly behind the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and I'm her to reaffirm that with the foreign minister today,"" Blinken said. ""That's particularly important in a time when we're seeing, unfortunately, Russia take very provocative action when it comes to Ukraine. We're now seeing the largest concentration of Russian forces on Ukraine's border since 2014. That is a big concern not only to Ukraine, but to the United States and indeed to many of our allies and partners."" Sitting across from him, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the Russian buildup was ""taking place not only along the border of Ukraine, but along the border of the democratic world. For thousands of kilometers to the north and to the east of our border with Russia, there is no democracy. So, this is the struggle that is taking place between democracies and authoritarianism, and in this struggle the support of the United States is absolutely crucial, and deeply appreciated."" Kuleba thanked NATO, also, and said that warnings already conveyed to Moscow through diplomatic channels, ""will be supported by actions that make it very clear for Russia that the price of further aggression against Ukraine will be too heavy for it to bear."" He said the Ukrainian and U.S. delegations in Brussels, and more broadly the NATO allies at large, would continue discussing ways to ensure stability along his country's tense border with Russia. While no NATO deployments have been confirmed, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed the alliance was planning to position 40,000 more troops and 15,000 pieces of military equipment close to Russian territory. He didn't elaborate, but said that ""in response to the military activity of the alliance that threatens Russia, we have taken appropriate measures."" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier on Tuesday that he was ""seriously concerned"" by Russia's deployment of additional forces to the Ukrainian border. ""Russia is now trying to reestablish some kind of sphere of influence where they try to decide what neighbors can do,"" Stoltenberg said.

2021-04-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-intelligence-2021-annual-threat-assessment/,"U.S. intelligence warns of ""diverse array"" of global threats in annual assessment","Washington — In a new report released Tuesday, the U.S. intelligence community warned of a ""diverse array"" of global threats that could further destabilize a world shaken by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, technological change and international competition. The 2021 Annual Threat Assessment, a 27-page unclassified document outlining the collective view of the country's 18 intelligence agencies, said ""the potential for cascading events in an increasingly interconnected and mobile world"" would create new and unique challenges, as known adversaries continue to jockey for influence and climate change heightens instability. The report said China, Russia, Iran and North Korea would seek to challenge U.S. interests in different arenas and on multiple levels, and that transnational crime, cyber attacks and terrorist plots posed continued threats. Domestic violent extremists, as the intelligence community forecast in a separate report released last month, will pose an ""elevated threat."" The COVID-19 pandemic, the assessment said, would ""continue to strain governments and societies, fueling humanitarian and economic crises, political unrest, and geopolitical competition,"" even after the broad administration of vaccines. ""The economic fallout from the pandemic is likely to create or worsen instability in at least a few—and perhaps many—countries, as people grow more desperate in the face of interlocking pressures that include sustained economic downturns, job losses, and disrupted supply chains,"" the report said. Intelligence officials said Beijing viewed its competition with the United States as part of an ""epochal geopolitical shift"" and would continue amassing military, economic and technological prowess to preserve the influence of the Chinese Communist Party. The country would continue making advancements in space and satellite technologies, with a Chinese space station expected to be operational ""between 2022 and 2024,"" and pose a ""prolific and effective"" cyber threat. ""We continue to assess that China can launch cyber attacks that, at a minimum, can cause localized, temporary disruptions to critical infrastructure within the United States,"" the report said. Russia will grow its ""strategic cooperation"" with China and present ""one of the most serious intelligence threats to the United States,"" officials said, noting Moscow interfered in U.S. elections in 2016, 2018 and 2020. ""Moscow almost certainly views US elections as an opportunity to try to undermine US global standing, sow discord inside the United States, influence US decisionmaking, and sway US voters,"" according to the assessment. Iran, intelligence officials assessed, is ""not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities that we judge would be necessary to produce a nuclear device"" – but had resumed some activities in violation of the terms of the 2018 nuclear agreement. Tehran will continue to deploy conventional and unconventional tools to undermine the United States, the report said, and remain a ""significant threat"" in the cyber domain. North Korea's nuclear ambitions, according to the assessment, remain constant. Kim Jong Un, its leader, ""probably does not view the current level of pressure on his regime as enough to require a fundamental change in its approach."" The cyber and conventional military threat from Pyongyang, officials said, would grow. In a statement accompanying the report, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Avril Haines said the U.S. public ""should know as much as possible about the threats facing our nation and what their intelligence agencies are doing to protect them."" ""This report provides transparency to Congress and our nation's citizens with the aim of bolstering trust in our work and institutions,"" she said. Haines and the leaders of key U.S intelligence and national security agencies are expected to testify on the assessment and other threats before two congressional committees on Wednesday and Thursday — marking the first such public appearance in more than two years. The Senate and House Intelligence Committees each announced last week that their members would receive public testimony from Haines; Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns; FBI Director Chris Wray; General Paul Nakasone, the director of the National Security Agency; and Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Known as the Worldwide Threats Hearing, the joint appearance has traditionally served as an opportunity for U.S. national security leadership to identify top areas of concern and explain how their respective agencies are positioned to confront global challenges. The directors are expected to field questions on the broad range of threats outlined in the report, but may also be pressed on specific issues like fallout from the SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange cyber intrusions, Iran's nuclear centrifuge testing and the heightened threat from domestic violent extremism. The hearing, a years-long annual tradition, did not take place at all in 2020, after protracted negotiations between then-DNI John Ratcliffe and the committees about the format of the event ended in a stalemate. Though the hearing has typically taken place in two parts — a public, open session with agency leaders providing opening statements and engaging in a question-and-answer period, followed by a session where classified matters are discussed behind closed doors — Ratcliffe pushed for the committees to accept a prepared opening statement but hold the entirety of question-and-answer sessions behind closed doors. Officials familiar with the discussions said the push for an altered format was in part to avoid stoking the ire of then-President Donald Trump, who publicly criticized the assessments presented by his intelligence chiefs at the January 2019 hearing — the last one to be held publicly. Congress has since mandated that the intelligence community provide an annual, written threat assessment and that the heads of relevant agencies appear for public testimony. The 2019 assessment warned of a strategic rapprochement between Russia and China, whose geopolitical interests, intelligence leaders warned, could increasingly align. It also said election interference would be on the rise and that cyber intrusions would threaten ""both minds and machines in an expanding number of ways."" The assessment also warned of the potentially devastating effects of a pandemic, to which it said the United States remained ""vulnerable."" ""We assess that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or largescale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support,"" the 2019 assessment said. Last week, the National Intelligence Council, an arm of the intelligence community focused on long-term strategic analysis, also released a comprehensive forecast predicting more frequent and intense global challenges through 2040, ranging from climate change to financial crises. ""These challenges will repeatedly test the resilience and adaptability of communities, states, and the international system, often exceeding the capacity of existing systems and models,"" that report said. ""This looming disequilibrium between existing and future challenges and the ability of institutions and systems to respond is likely to grow and produce greater contestation at every level.""",20,3.7560057494601904,6.954064623678994,-3.198058874218803,18
2021-04-12,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-news-putin-moves-russian-troops-to-border-and-crimea/,"Ukraine says Russia has moved 80,000 troops to border and Crimea, and Putin won't talk","Moscow — Ukraine's government said on Monday that requests by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to speak with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about the escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine had been ignored. Moscow denied receiving any request from Kyiv for such talks. Tension between the neighbors has grown steadily for several weeks, with intensified skirmishes in eastern Ukraine — a region that has been mired in conflict since Russia first backed Ukrainian separatists there seven years ago. Putin has sent thousands of forces toward the Ukrainian border recently, raising concerns among politicians in the United States and European Union. ""The president's office, of course, made a request to speak with Vladimir Putin. We have not received an answer yet and we very much hope that this is not a refusal of dialogue,"" Ukrainian presidential spokeswoman Iuliia Mendel told Reuters on Monday. She told Russia's Interfax news agency that the request for talks was sent on March 26, after four Ukrainian servicemen were killed by shelling in the country's east. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that he ""hasn't seen any requests in the past several days."" Mendel said Russia had massed more than 40,000 troops on Ukraine's eastern border, and more than 40,000 in Crimea, the region that Putin unilaterally annexed away from Ukraine and declared Russian in 2014. Mendel said Zelenskyy would travel to Paris for talks this week on Russia's actions and the escalating conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region, Reuters reported. The current escalation is also further straining U.S.-Russian relations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned Russia against aggressive actions, accusing Putin's military of massing more forces near the Ukrainian border than at any time since 2014. ""President Biden's been very clear about this: If Russia acts recklessly or aggressively, there will be costs, there will be consequences,"" Blinken said during an interview over the weekend. The Kremlin has said that Russian and Ukrainian political advisers are working to organize a possible new round of talks under the so-called Normandy format — a multilateral dialogue that would involve the leaders of France and Germany. German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer on Monday called on Moscow to declare its intentions in the region, saying that if Putin's government ""has nothing to hide, it could easily explain why troops are being moved."" Manfred Weber, a prominent Member of the European Parliament from Germany, called Russia's troop buildup a test for the West, warning that if the situation continues to escalate, Moscow should face new sanctions. ""The answer needs to be clear and tough,"" he said. In an interview with CNN given as he visited his troops on the front line, Zelenskyy said Ukraine, ""needs more than words"" of support from Washington and other European allies as it faces off with Russia. The Kremlin has repeatedly said that Russia's military forces are free to move around within the country's territory as they see fit, and that the troop movements near the Ukrainian border — exercises, according to Moscow — pose no threat. Last week, Putin accused Ukraine of ""dangerous provocative actions"" in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Relations between Kyiv and Moscow have worsened since Putin first backed the separatists in the area and seized Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin insists its support for the separatists is limited to political and humanitarian backing, but the West has long accused Putin of sending military forces and hardware. The seven-year conflict between the pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian government has claimed more than 13,000 lives. On Sunday, the Ukrainian military reported another death — a soldier purportedly killed by artillery fire from the Russian-backed fighters. Over the weekend, Kremlin spokesman Peskov said no further peace talks could take place before conditions laid out in the Minsk peace accords were met. The Minsk accords, reached during 2015 talks in neighboring Belarus, brought an end to the worst of the hostilities in Donbas, but the full agreement has never been fully implemented. Since then, peace talks have been stalled, with Russia and Ukraine failing to find any new common ground.",4,3.848471221398859,0.7435360432086024,3.1049351781902566,7

The White House said Mr. Biden had confirmed to President Volodymir Zelenskyy ""the United States' unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia's ongoing aggression."" Zelenskyy said in a tweet that he was ""glad to talk to"" Mr. Biden, and that he appreciated the ""U.S. support on different levels. We stand shoulder to shoulder when it comes to preservation of our democracies."" Moscow and Ukraine have exchanged hostile remarks this week as a buildup of Russian troops and military hardware near the countries' shared border stokes fears of a fresh wave of violence. A military conflict between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine's NATO-backed army has ground on in the east of Ukraine for seven years. Ukrainian Defense Minister Andrii Taran has spoken twice recently with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, most recently on Thursday, about the escalation of violence in the east of Ukraine. According to a readout issued by Ukraine's military, Austin promised his counterpart that, ""in the event of escalation of Russian aggression, the United States will not leave Ukraine alone."" The Kremlin reacted on Friday by saying that any deployment of U.S. or NATO troops to Ukraine would force Moscow to take unspecified ""extra measures"" to ensure its own security. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the situation along the so-called line of contact in eastern Ukraine, which separates the Ukrainian government forces and the Russian-backed separatists, was ""quite frightening."" Moscow has repeatedly blamed the current escalation on Ukrainian ""provocations"" in the region. When asked about the reported build-up of troops near the Ukrainian border and the Russian annexed Crimean Peninsula on Thursday, Peskov said that Russia moves its military forces within its own territory however it chooses, and ""takes measures to ensure the security of its borders."" He reiterated Russia's longstanding denials of any military involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which reached a crescendo in 2014 when President Vladimir Putin unilaterally annexed Crimea away from Ukraine, drawing condemnation and sanctions from the U.S. and Europe which remain in place today. A U.S. military official initially called the buildup of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border ""concerning"" this week, but later told CBS News national defense correspondent David Martin that it did appear to be a training exercise, albeit not exactly fitting the description of the wargames announced last month by the Russian Ministry of Defense. NATO officials also voiced concern over the sizable Russian military buildup near the border this week. Relations between Kyiv and Moscow have worsened since Putin backed the separatists in eastern Ukraine — support his government insists is only political and humanitarian — and seized control of Crimea in 2014. The military conflict between the pro-Russian rebels and Kyiv has continued simmering for seven years, claiming at least 14,000 lives since it began. In the first major flare-up in months, Ukraine said four of its soldiers were killed and two were injured a week ago by shelling in the country's east. The separatists denied responsible for the deaths. The OSCE's civilian Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine has reported hundreds of cease-fire violations in recent days. During a video conference call on Tuesday with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russia's Putin ""expressed serious concern about the escalation of armed confrontation,"" according to the Kremlin. He placed the blame squarely on Kyiv. Some analysts believe the simmering conflict was always going to ramp back up again at some point, given the lack of progress toward any peaceful, political resolution and the significant presence of weaponry and armed forces in the region. But most believe it's too soon to say how the current flareup will play out. Katharine Quinn-Judge, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, told CBS News that while ceasefire provisions laid out in July 2020 do seem to have ushered a considerable reduction in violence, that ceasefire was always destined to fray. ""This doesn't necessarily mean there will be a major escalation. Neither side wants to bear the political or economic costs this would bring,"" she said in comments emailed to CBS News from Kyiv. ""But these occasional spikes in violence... play to the interests of hardliners on all sides: They're a handy reminder that the enemy can never be trusted and that reconciliation under current circumstances is impossible."" The Minsk accords, reached during 2015 talks in neighboring Belarus, brought an end to the worst of the hostilities, but peace talks have been stalled for years, with Russia and Ukraine failing to find any common ground on which to build. Konstantin Skorkin, a contributor to the Moscow Carnegie Center, says Russia hasn't been able to get any of the concessions from Kyiv that it had hoped for when Zelenskyy came to power in 2019. Now, with the new Biden administration in Washington, Zelensky appears ever more confident that he'll have U.S. backing in his standoff with Russia. Skorkin told CBS News in a telephone interview that, in the circumstances, both sides may be deliberately inflaming the situation to ""raise stakes in the negotiations."" ""Russia demonstrates its might, while Ukraine demonstrates that it is not afraid of Russia,"" he said. But Skorkin warned that in such a tense atmosphere, with the heavy military presence, any incident could trigger an actual escalation of the armed fighting — regardless of whether either side really wants one.

But the gathering of troops comes amid heightened tension in the region, and Ukraine's Commander-In-Chief Ruslan Khomchack told his country's parliament this week that Russian forces from different regions had been assembling near the border. Russia's president has acknowledged an ""escalation of armed confrontation"" in the region. Training exercises were always a possible explanation for the buildup, but a U.S. defense official told CBS News that the locations and types of units seen on the ground didn't line up with what the Russian Ministry of Defense had announced last month. In a statement on Facebook on Wednesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that at the initiative of the U.S., chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milley, had a telephone conversation with his counterpart. ""Issues of mutual interest were discussed,"" the statement said. Ukraine and Russia have been in conflict since Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. The U.S. and its NATO allies do not recognize Russia's annexation of the peninsula, and the U.S contributes millions in both non-military and military aid each year to Ukraine. Relations between the two countries have been getting worse. Just four days ago, four Ukrainian soldiers were killed by Russian separatist shelling in eastern Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin noted the increase in violence on Tuesday, and blamed Ukrainian forces for it. An official readout from the Kremlin of a phone call that Putin had with the French and German leaders said he had, ""expressed serious concern about the escalation of armed confrontation on the contact line being provoked by Ukraine."" The U.S. Embassy in Kiev issued a statement last week calling on Russia to ""observe ceasefire measures"" and ""end daily violence that is causing senseless suffering,"" and end its aggression in Ukraine.

2021-03-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/william-burns-confirmed-cia-director-senate/,William Burns wins Senate confirmation as next CIA director,"Washington — The Senate unanimously confirmed William Burns as the next director of the CIA on Thursday, weeks after the Senate Intelligence Committee advanced his nomination. Burns' confirmation had been held up by Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who sought to pressure the Biden administration to issue sanctions on entities involved in building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline — a years-long, multi-billion-dollar project that would allow Russia to ship gas directly to Germany, bypassing U.S. ally Ukraine. The Senate approved Burns' nomination by voice vote Thursday afternoon after Cruz lifted his hold. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, applauded his confirmation, saying he is ""confident that Director Burns, a loyal public servant, will lead the CIA with integrity and objectivity, and provide the leadership and support that the brave men and women of the CIA deserve."" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines also welcomed Burns' confirmation. ""Bill is an extraordinary public servant, having dedicated the majority of his life to government service representing our country with distinction as a diplomat and a leader around the world,"" Haines said in statement. ""I look forward to working with him to advance the Intelligence Community's mission in service to our nation."" A career diplomat, Burns sailed through a largely amicable confirmation hearing last month, where he told senators he would focus on four main priorities as director: challenges from China, boosting the spy agency's technological prowess, strengthening its workforce, and boosting partnerships within the U.S. intelligence community and abroad. He committed to developing new capabilities within CIA to help deter future cyber incursions like the SolarWinds breach, and pledged to ensure that agency officers who were injured in microwave attacks thought to have been carried out by Russia received proper care. ""If I'm confirmed as director of CIA, I will have no higher priority than taking care of people, of colleagues and their families,"" Burns testified. In a statement, Cruz said he lifted his hold on Burns' nomination after Secretary of State Antony Blinken made what Cruz called a ""strong declaration"" alluding to sanctions designed to impede the Nord Stream 2 project. ""As the President has said, Nord Stream 2 is a bad deal — for Germany, for Ukraine, and for our Central and Eastern European allies and partners,"" Blinken said in his statement. ""As multiple U.S. administrations have made clear, this pipeline is a Russian geopolitical project intended to divide Europe and weaken European energy security."" Blinken added that the State Department ""reiterates its warning that any entity involved in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline risks U.S. sanctions and should immediately abandon work on the pipeline."" Cruz also lifted a hold on Brian McKeon, nominated by the president to be deputy secretary of state for management and resources, but he said he would continue to delay the confirmation of deputy secretary of state nominee Wendy Sherman ""until the full sanctions mandated by Congress are in fact broadly imposed"" against entities involved in completing the pipeline. Burns succeeds Gina Haspel, who led the agency since 2018. She announced her retirement from the agency in January of this year.

2021-03-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/putin-biden-trump-2020-election-intelligence-report/,U.S. says Putin authorized operations to denigrate Biden and boost Trump in 2020 campaign,"Washington — Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations that sought to damage President Biden's candidacy during the 2020 election and boost former President Donald Trump, according to an unclassified report from the U.S. intelligence community on foreign threats to the 2020 elections released Tuesday. The report, released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, outlined five key judgments on efforts by foreign actors to influence or interfere in U.S. elections, including Moscow's attempts, directed by the highest echelons of the Russian government, to undermine public confidence in the electoral process and sow division among Americans. ""A key element of Moscow's strategy this election cycle was its use of proxies linked to Russian intelligence to push influence narratives — including misleading or unsubstantiated allegations against President Biden — to U.S. media organizations, U.S. officials, and prominent U.S. individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration,"" the declassified report stated. The intelligence community assessed with ""high confidence"" that Russia and Iran used misinformation to undermine public confidence in election processes and results. There were no indications, however, that any foreign actor attempted to alter voting systems or other technical aspects of voting, such as voter registration, casting ballots, vote tabulation or reporting results. While the report criticizes attempts by Russia and Iran to interfere in the 2020 election, the intelligence community assessed with high confidence that China ""did not deploy interference efforts and considered but did not deploy influence efforts intended to change the outcome"" of the presidential election. Still, other foreign actors — Lebanon's Hezbollah, Cuba and Venezuela — mounted some efforts to attempt to influence the election, though they were ""smaller in scale"" than actions taken by other foreign actors. An August assessment from the intelligence community warned of ongoing activity by China, Russia and Iran ahead of the November election, noting China preferred Mr. Trump lose his reelection bid. Russia's efforts in the 2020 election differed from its influence campaign in 2016, as the report from the intelligence community published Tuesday found it ""did not see persistent Russian cyber efforts to gain access to election infrastructure."" Instead, a ""key element"" of its strategy was to use people tied to Russian intelligence services ""to launder influence narratives"" through the media, U.S. officials and prominent Americans. According to the report, Putin oversaw the activities of Andriy Derkach, a pro-Russian Ukrainian lawmaker, to spread narratives designed to hurt Mr. Biden. Derkach was sanctioned by the Trump administration in September. ""The primary effort the IC uncovered revolved around a narrative — that Russian actors began spreading as early as 2014 — alleging corrupt ties between President Biden, his family and other U.S. officials and Ukraine,"" the report stated. Another individual, Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate of Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort who is characterized as a ""Russian influence agent,"" attempted to damage U.S. ties to Ukraine and hurt Mr. Biden's candidacy, the report said. Kilimnik, Derkach and associates attempted to use ""prominent U.S. persons and media conduits to launder their narratives to U.S. officials and audience,"" the intelligence community assessed. ""These Russian proxies met with and provided materials to Trump administration-linked U.S. persons to advocate for formal investigations; hired a U.S. firm to petition U.S. officials; and attempted to make contact with several U.S. officials. They also made contact with established U.S. media figures and helped produce a documentary that aired on a U.S. television network in late January 2020,"" the report said. Russian state media, trolls and online proxies ""published disparaging content about President Biden, his family and the Democratic Party, and heavily amplified related content circulating in U.S. media, including stories centered on his son,"" while Russian internet influence actors promoted Mr. Trump and his messages on the election and impeachment inquiry, the report stated. The intelligence community further found Russian hackers attempted to breach organizations affiliated with the Democratic Party after the 2018 midterm elections and targeted U.S. political actors in 2019 and 2020. The motivation behind Moscow's attempts to harm Mr. Biden's candidacy stemmed from the Kremlin's belief that his election would be ""disadvantageous to Russian interests,"" according to the report. Iran, meanwhile, mounted an influence campaign, likely authorized by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, to hurt Mr. Trump's reelection prospects and exacerbate divisions in the U.S., the declassified assessment stated. ""Iran's efforts in 2020 — especially its emails to individual U.S. voters and efforts to spread allegations of voter fraud — were more aggressive than in past election cycles,"" the intelligence community said. Iranian cyber actors were found to be responsible for threatening emails sent to Democratic voters in several states that purported to come from the right-wing extremist group the Proud Boys, as well a website containing death threats against U.S. election officials. Tehran focused its campaign on social media and propaganda on ""perceived vulnerabilities"" in the U.S., including the response to the coronavirus pandemic, economic downturn and civil unrest. ""Foreign malign influence is an enduring challenge facing our country,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in a statement. ""These efforts by U.S. adversaries seek to exacerbate divisions and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions. Addressing this ongoing challenge requires a whole-of-government approach grounded in an accurate understanding of the problem, which the Intelligence Community, through assessments such as this one, endeavors to provide."" The report made public Tuesday was a declassified version of a classified report provided to the president, senior executive branch officials, congressional leadership and intelligence oversight committees January 7. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said the assessment underscores what was already known: Russia interfered to help Mr. Trump and harm Mr. Biden, and undermine confidence in the electoral process. ""No matter which nation seeks to influence our political system and who stands to benefit, both parties must speak with one voice and disavow all interference in our elections,"" Schiff said in a statement. ""We must guard against and seek to deter all attempts at foreign interference, and ensure that American voters decide American elections.""",20,5.063405170170477,2.6531206667719887,2.4102845033984885,29

""There will be areas in which it will be in our mutual self-interest to work with China,"" Burns said in his opening remarks before the panel, but said ""predatory Chinese leadership"" nonetheless posed the ""biggest geopolitical test"" faced by the United States. Burns said, if confirmed, he would implement a ""whole-of-agency approach to the operational and analytical challenges of this crucial threat,"" including by increasing the number of China specialists and Mandarin speakers at the CIA. He also cited lingering threats from the likes of Russia, North Korea and Iran, whose hostile behaviors Burns said would continue, in ways both ""familiar"" and unpredictable. ""Most of my white hair came from serving in Russia over the years,"" said Burns, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008 and dealt personally with its current president, Vladimir Putin. Under Putin, Burns said, Russia will continue to be ""at least as disruptive"" as China. Burns also fielded questions about the recent SolarWinds cyberattack on federal agencies and private sector companies, which the Biden administration has blamed on Russia. Burns called the intrusion a ""harsh wake-up call"" and said the U.S. must shore up crucial infrastructure to prevent and deter breaches. ""I think it's essential for the CIA in particular to work even harder to develop our capabilities to help detect these kinds of attacks when they come from external players, from foreign players, which is the responsibility of the CIA,"" Burns said, adding that the U.S. should ""develop our own technological and cyber capabilities"" to deter future attacks. ""Over time, I've been convinced, [we should] work with like-minded countries, allies and partners to not only build leverage, but to build rules of the road that help protect critical infrastructure, that help make clear international understandings that certain kinds of critical infrastructure are off-limits for those kinds of cyberattacks,"" Burns continued. ""That'll take time. That'll take enormous effort. But I think the CIA and intelligence will be an important part of that effort."" In response to concerns raised by multiple lawmakers of both parties, Burns also promised to ""get to the bottom"" of mysterious microwave attacks that have sickened dozens of former intelligence officers and diplomats since 2016. He repeatedly pledged to ensure agency employees and their families who were injured in the microwave attacks would get ""the care that they deserve"" from the National Institutes of Health and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. ""If I'm confirmed as director of CIA, I will have no higher priority than taking care of people, of colleagues and their families. And I do commit to you that if I'm confirmed, I will make it an extraordinarily high priority to get to the bottom of who's responsible for the attacks,"" Burns said. In 2016 and 2017, dozens of Americans who had worked in diplomatic facilities in China and Cuba came down with serious brain injuries, suffering what came to be known as ""Havana syndrome."" At least 40 Americans, including diplomats and CIA spies, came down with neurologic symptoms including memory loss, impaired vision and loss of balance. A U.S. government report issued in December 2020 found that ""Havana syndrome"" was likely caused by a form of targeted microwave energy, but the origin of the attack is still unknown. Former officers have said they suspect Russia is behind the attacks. ""It was very encouraging, and frankly pretty emotional to me personally, that Bill Burns pledged to Senators Rubio, Warner and Collins that he would absolutely ensure proper medical care at Walter Reed for our officers who are [traumatic brain injury] victims,"" said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA officer who began suffering debilitating symptoms after a trip to Moscow in 2017. He has struggled to receive medical care since then. At the beginning of the hearing, Burns was introduced by former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director Leon Panetta, who served during the Obama and Clinton administrations, and former Secretary of State James Baker, who served during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. Panetta and Baker both praised Burns' long record of public service and urged senators to confirm him. Baker called Burns ""one of the finest and most intelligent American diplomats that I had the pleasure of working with."" His confirmation, Baker said, should be a ""bipartisan no-brainer."" Members of the committee near-uniformly praised Burns for his diplomatic accomplishments, and many posed questions that probed his knowledge of foreign policy rather than intelligence matters. Burns spent over three decades at the State Department, where he served as deputy secretary of state from 2011 to 2014. He has since retired from government and has been serving as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. If confirmed, he will be the first career diplomat to lead the CIA, though he served as ambassador in significant overseas posts — including Moscow and Amman — where the agency maintains a robust presence. He was also among the small group of U.S. officials tasked by former President Barack Obama to lead secret discussions with Iran about a potential nuclear deal beginning in 2013, though he left government before the final agreement was struck two years later, in 2015. The Biden administration has made several overtures to Tehran in an effort to restart talks on the nuclear deal, most of which have been publicly rebuffed. Burns' extensive overseas experience and contacts, alongside his reputation as a serious statesman, have made his nomination a welcome one to current and former intelligence officials. ""Bill Burns will make a terrific DCIA. He has been a consumer of intelligence for years, and he has worked closely with CIA officers both in Washington and overseas,"" said Michael Morell, former CIA acting director and CBS News Senior National Security contributor. ""Most important, his humanity and care for people will win over the organization."" Morell was himself considered a top candidate for the directorship but withdrew his candidacy after several Democratic senators indicated they would oppose his nomination over past comments he made about CIA's enhanced interrogation program. During the Trump administration, the agency was thrust repeatedly into an uncomfortable spotlight by the president himself, who complained frequently about what he termed a ""Deep State"" of operatives bent on undermining his administration. Burns' immediate predecessor, Gina Haspel, largely avoided public appearances throughout her tenure. At the hearing, Burns committed to keeping politics out of intelligence — something he said Mr. Biden had personally demanded. ""He said he wants the agency to give it to him straight,"" Burns said, ""and I pledged to do just that, and to defend those who do the same."" Burns, who has already held five Senate-confirmed positions, is expected to be confirmed on a bipartisan basis for a sixth time.",20,1.56949703331352,2.339858644346431,-0.7703616110329108,18
2021-02-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/solarwinds-hack-russia-cyberattack-60-minutes-2021-02-14/,"SolarWinds: How Russian spies hacked the Justice, State, Treasury, Energy and Commerce Departments","President Biden inherited a lot of intractable problems, but perhaps none is as disruptive as the cyber war between the United States and Russia simmering largely under the radar. Last March, with the coronavirus spreading uncontrollably across the United States, Russian cyber soldiers released their own contagion by sabotaging a tiny piece of computer code buried in a popular piece of software called ""SolarWinds."" The hidden virus spread to 18,000 government and private computer networks by way of one of those software updates we all take for granted. The attack was unprecedented in audacity and scope. Russian spies went rummaging through the digital files of the U.S. departments of Justice, State, Treasury, Energy, and Commerce and for nine months had unfettered access to top-level communications, court documents, even nuclear secrets. And by all accounts, it's still going on. Brad Smith: I think from a software engineering perspective, it's probably fair to say that this is the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen. Brad Smith is president of Microsoft. He learned about the hack after the presidential election this past November. By that time, the stealthy intruders had spread throughout the tech giants' computer network and stolen some of its proprietary source code used to build its software products. More alarming: how the hackers got in… piggy-backing on a piece of third party software used to connect, manage and monitor computer networks. Bill Whitaker: What makes this so momentous? Brad Smith: One of the really disconcerting aspects of this attack was the widespread and indiscriminate nature of it. What this attacker did was identify network management software from a company called SolarWinds. They installed malware into an update for a SolarWinds product. When that update went out to 18,000 organizations around the world, so did this malware. ""SolarWinds Orion"" is one of the most ubiquitous software products you probably never heard of, but to thousands of I.T. departments worldwide, it's indispensable. It's made up of millions of lines of computer code. 4,032 of them were clandestinely re-written and distributed to customers in a routine update, opening up a secret backdoor to the 18,000 infected networks. Microsoft has assigned 500 engineers to dig in to the attack. One compared it to a Rembrandt painting, the closer they looked, the more details emerged. Brad Smith: When we analyzed everything that we saw at Microsoft, we asked ourselves how many engineers have probably worked on these attacks. And the answer we came to was, well, certainly more than 1,000. Bill Whitaker: You guys are Microsoft. How did Microsoft miss this? Brad Smith: I think that when you look at the sophistication of this attacker there's an asymmetric advantage for somebody playing offense. Bill Whitaker: Is it still going on? Brad Smith: Almost certainly, these attacks are continuing. The world still might not know about the hack if not for FireEye, a three-and-a-half billion dollar cybersecurity company run by Kevin Mandia, a former Air Force intelligence officer. Kevin Mandia: I can tell you this, if we didn't do investigations for a living, we wouldn't have found this. It takes a very special skill set to reverse engineer a whole platform that's written by bad guys to never be found. FireEye's core mission is to hunt, find, and expel cyber intruders from the computer networks of their clients - mostly governments and major companies. But FireEye used SolarWinds software, which turned the cyber hunter into the prey. This past November, one alert FireEye employee noticed something amiss. Kevin Mandia: Just like everybody working from home, we have two-factor authentication. A code pops up on our phone. We have to type in that code. And then we can log in. A FireEye employee was logging in, but the difference was our security staff looked at the login and we noticed that individual had two phones registered to their name. So our security employee called that person up and we asked, ""Hey, did you actually register a second device on our network?"" And our employee said, ""No. It wasn't, it wasn't me."" Suspicious, FireEye turned its gaze inward, and saw intruders impersonating its employees snooping around inside their network, stealing FireEye's proprietary tools to test its clients defenses and intelligence reports on active cyber threats. The hackers left no evidence of how they broke in – no phishing expeditions, no malware. Bill Whitaker: So how did you trace this back to SolarWinds software? Kevin Mandia: It was not easy. We took a lotta people and said, ""Turn every rock over. Look in every machine and find any trace of suspicious activity."" What kept coming back was the earliest evidence of compromise is the SolarWinds system. We finally decided: Tear the thing apart. They discovered the malware inside SolarWinds and on December 13 informed the world of the brazen attack. Much of the damage had already been done. The U.S. Justice Department acknowledged the Russians spent months inside their computers accessing email traffic – but the department won't tell us exactly what was taken. It's the same at Treasury, Commerce, the NIH, Energy. Even the agency that protects and transports our nuclear arsenal. The hackers also hit the biggest names in high tech. Bill Whitaker: So, what does that target list tell you? Brad Smith: I think this target list tells us that this is clearly a foreign intelligence agency. It exposes the secrets potentially of the United States and other governments as well as private companies. I don't think anyone knows for certain how all of this information will be used. But we do know this: It is in the wrong hands. And Microsoft's Brad Smith told us it's almost certain the hackers created additional backdoors and spread to other networks. The revelation this past December came at a fraught time in the U.S. President Trump was disputing the election, and tweeted China might be responsible for the hack. Within hours he was contradicted by his own secretary of state and attorney general. They blamed Russia. The Department of Homeland Security, FBI and intelligence agencies concurred. The prime suspect: the SVR, one of several Russian spy agencies the U.S. labels ""advanced persistent threats."" Russia denies it was involved. Brad Smith: I do think this was an act of recklessness. The world runs on software. It runs on information technology. But it can't run with confidence if major governments are disrupting and attacking the software supply chain in this way. Bill Whitaker: That almost sounds like you think that they went in to foment chaos? Brad Smith: What we are seeing is the first use of this supply chain disruption tactic against the United States. But it's not the first time we've witnessed it. The Russian government really developed this tactic in Ukraine. For years the Russians have tested their cyber weapons on Ukraine. NotPetya, a 2017 attack by the GRU, Russia's military spy agency, used the same tactics as the SolarWinds attack, sabotaging a widely-used piece of software to break into thousands of Ukraine's networks, but instead of spying - it ordered devices to self-destruct. Brad Smith: It literally damaged more than 10% of that nation's computers in a single day. The television stations couldn't produce their shows because they relied on computers. Automated teller machines stopped working. Grocery stores couldn't take a credit card. Now, what we saw with this attack was something that was more targeted, but it just shows how if you engage in this kind of tactic, you can unleash an enormous amount of damage and havoc. Bill Whitaker: It's hard to downplay the severity of this. Chris Inglis: It is hard to downplay the severity of this. Because it's only a stone's throw from a computer network attack. Chris Inglis spent 28 years commanding the nation's best cyber warriors at the National Security Agency – seven as its deputy director – and now sits on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission – created by Congress to come up with new ideas to defend our digital domain. Bill Whitaker: Why didn't the government detect this? Chris Inglis: The government is not looking on private sector networks. It doesn't surveil private sector networks. That's a responsibility that's given over to the private sector. FireEye found it on theirs, many others did not. The government did not find it on their network, so that's a disappointment. Disappointment is an understatement. The Department of Homeland Security spent billions on a program called ""Einstein"" to detect cyber attacks on government agencies. The Russians outsmarted it. They circumvented the NSA, which gathers intelligence overseas, but is prohibited from surveilling U.S. computer networks. So the Russians launched their attacks from servers set up anonymously in the United States. Bill Whitaker: This hack happened on American soil. It went through networks based in the United States. Are our defense capabilities constrained? Chris Inglis: U.S. Intelligence Community, U.S. Department of Defense, can suggest what the intentions of other nations are based upon what they learn in their rightful work overseas. But they can't turn around and focus their unblinking eye on the domestic infrastructure. That winds up making it more difficult for us. He says history shows that once inside a network, the Russians are a stubborn adversary. Chris Inglis: It's hard to kind of get something like this completely out of the system. And they certainly don't understand all the places that it's gone to, all of the manifestations of where this virus, where this software still lives. And that's gonna take some time. And the only way you'll have absolute confidence that you've gotten rid of it is to get rid of the hardware, to get rid of the systems. Bill Whitaker: Wow. So unless you get rid of all the computers and all the computer networks, you will not be sure that you have gotten this out of the systems. Chris Inglis: You will not be. Jon Miller: We've never been left with a breach like that before where we know months into it that we're only looking at the tip of the iceberg. It's not everyday you meet someone who builds cyber weapons as complex as those deployed by Russian intelligence. But Jon Miller, who started off as a hacker and now runs a company called Boldend, designs and sells cutting-edge cyber weapons to U.S. intelligence agencies. Jon Miller: I build things much more sophisticated than this. What's impressive is the scope of it. This is a watershed style attack. I would never do something like this. It creates too much damage. Miller says with the SolarWinds attack, Russia has demonstrated that none of the software we take for granted is truly safe, including the apps on our telephones, laptops, and tablets. These days, he says, any device can be sabotaged. Jon Miller: When you buy something from a tech company, a new phone or a laptop, you trust that that is secure when they give it to you. And what they've shown us in this attack is that is not the case. They have the ability to compromise those supply chains and manipulate whatever they want. Whether it's financial data, source code, the functionality of these products. They can take control. Bill Whitaker: So, for instance, they could destroy all the computers on a network? Jon Miller: Oh, easily. The malware that they deployed off of SolarWinds, it didn't have the functionality in it to do that. But to do that is trivial. Couple dozen lines of code. Bill Whitaker: And there're still some companies that don't yet know they were breached? Jon Miller: It's still ongoing. New companies are getting breached. We'll see new companies breached today that weren't breached this morning. Where it's different in a lot of ways is normally when you catch someone in the act, they stop. That's not the case with this breach. Produced by Graham Messick and Jack Weingart. Broadcast associate, Emilio Almonte.

The Federal Security Service (FSB) said it had carried out a multi-stage mission with the US Department of Justice that ended with the seizure of 330 kilograms of cocaine with an estimated street value of 1 billion rubles (about $13.6 million). Video released by the FSB to Russian media showed plainclothes agents dragging suspects from cars as well as boxes of confiscated cash and drugs. The security agency said in a statement that the joint-US operation had disrupted ""a transnational criminal community that specialized in smuggling cocaine from South America to Russia and other European states."" The mission elapsed in several stages beginning in May this year in Saint Petersburg and concluded with the discovery of a cache in the Moscow region last month, the FSB said. The operation was a rare example of cooperation between Russia and the United States, which share a deep and mutual distrust over a range of issues including election meddling and hacking. Lawmakers in Washington said earlier this month that Russia was behind a recent massive cyber attack on U.S. government institutions, allegations that Russia said lacked evidence. The two countries are also struggling to find common ground on the renewal of the New START nuclear arms control treaty which expires in February, 2021. President Vladimir Putin said this month that Russia's ties with the United States were unlikely to improve under the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden.",20,3.4342883224181753,3.9284056581086055,-0.49411733569043026,26
2020-12-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/solarwinds-fireeye-cyberattack-russia-hack-explained/,Here is what we know — and don't know — about the suspected Russian hack,"U.S. officials are deeply concerned about a massive and ongoing cyberattack targeting large companies and U.S. agencies, including the Treasury and Commerce Department. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) called the attack a ""grave risk"" to national security. Cybersecurity experts believe that in March a well-organized group of hackers exploited a loophole in products developed by SolarWinds, an IT firm that provides technology software for government agencies and hundreds of large companies, including Microsoft which helped investigate and report the attack. By hacking SolarWinds, the attacker was able to access sensitive information and monitor the communications of dozens of companies and agencies that use the company's software, including the departments of Treasury, Commerce and Energy, as well as the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which oversees nuclear weapons. Details about the hack are still emerging, but officials call it an ""attack"" because it was an overt action likely perpetrated by a nation-state. Experts like Nick Merrill, director of the Daylight cybersecurity lab at UC Berkeley, say the breach is more akin to ""cyber-espionage"" because the attackers monitored the communications of corporate and government officials for months. While it's unknown if nuclear protocols were compromised, Merrill says this was a ""sophisticated cyberattack,"" and ""it is certainly possible that the attackers exploited other vulnerabilities that we do not yet know about."" In early December the same ""highly sophisticated threat actor"" is alleged to have purloined digital tools developed by the cyber-defense firm FireEye. FireEye detected the breach and alerted authorities, which helped lead to the discovery of intrusions into other companies and agencies. Experts believe the attacks are related and perpetrated by a group known as ""Cozy Bear,"" the code name used for the SVR, a wing of Russian intelligence linked to several recent high-profile hacks including the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and the Olympics in 2018. Although President Trump downplayed the hack and suggested China could be responsible, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it's ""pretty clear"" Russia is the culprit. ""This was a very significant effort, and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,"" Pompeo said in an interview on the Mark Levin talk radio program. On Monday, Attorney General William Barr agreed with Pompeo, stating that it ""certainly appears to be the Russians."" Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, denied Russian involvement in the hack. ""Russia is not involved in such attacks, namely this one. We state this officially and firmly,"" he said, calling the accusations ""absolutely baseless"" and likely a result of ""blind Russophobia."" Digital forensic experts suspect the hackers compromised a tool called Orion, which centralizes network monitoring, and a service called NetLogon, which verifies login requests. They also breached Microsoft Office 365, a service used by a number of government agencies. Over 18,000 companies and agencies are confirmed to be impacted, and the number might be as high as 33,000. The attack method was novel, says Bryson Bort, a former Army signals intelligence officer and advisor to the Army Cyber Institute, because it apparently didn't rely on traditional hacking methods like phishing — using a deceptive email or link to gain access — or a zero-day exploit, which takes advantage of a previously unknown software vulnerability to surreptitiously access private networks. Instead, says Bort, hackers co-opted the software update process by inserting malicious code into the Solar Winds software before clients downloaded the latest version. ""Then they spread out and used all kinds of different software to establish persistence"" on the network. He added that even after the hack is investigated, there is ""still the possibility [the attackers] remain cloaked on various systems for years."" Congressman Jim Himes, a Democrat who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, told CBSN, ""It was a very cleverly designed hack because it used U.S. IP addresses, it used a U.S. company, Solar Winds, and therefore the usual people who sort of stand on the wall and look outward for attacks that come from abroad were fooled by there."" Neil Walsh, who runs cybersecurity for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, says that subterfuge is common in cyberattacks and proper attribution could be murky for a long time. ""Attacks of this scale take time to understand, mitigate and attribute,"" Walsh explained. ""Imagine that a burglar wanted to break into your home to steal your banking details. Instead of bashing the door down, over a period of months, they design and test a skeleton key for the lock on your house. Then they enter your house and work out that they can see everything. Then they make an invisibility cloak and wrap themselves in it."" The fallout could be equally difficult to predict, but experts fear the damage will be severe and far-reaching. ""The scale,"" said Himes, ""is massive."" In 2017 a group called Shadow Brokers, who were also linked to Russian intelligence, hacked and publicly released cyberweapons from the U.S. National Security Agency. Those cyber tools, known as EternalBlue, resulted in a virulent and potent strain of ransomware called NotPetya. Attackers used it to paralyze major companies and government offices in Europe and around the globe, causing more than $10 billion in damage. At the time, it was considered the most devastating cyberattack in history. This attack is different, says Joel Benavides, the head of Global Legal at Redis Labs, but the repercussions could be broad. For example, these hackers were able to snoop on sensitive communications — including the email accounts of top Treasury officials — exfiltrate data from restricted government databases, and swipe corporate intellectual property at an unprecedented scale. ""The tremendous economic, societal and military impact cannot be overemphasized,"" Benavides said. ""Remediation costs, regulatory fines, and potential loss of trade secrets and industrial know-how will run into the billions of dollars."" Himes said, ""We know that this hack managed to penetrate all sorts of networks. We just don't know things like did it get into particularly sensitive networks — that would be government national security networks, financial entities might have your account information that could be sent somewhere else where it could be misused."" The long term impact, Benavides added, might be that the attack ""exposes weaknesses in our governmental cybersecurity infrastructure while driving further suspicion and eroding the public's trust of the very institutions that are meant to keep us all safe.""",20,2.079639549561207,1.1368295967091226,0.9428099528520844,16

Pompeo made the remarks Friday on the conservative talk show ""The Mark Levin Show."" He said ""we're still unpacking precisely what it is, and I'm sure some of it will remain classified."" However, President Trump contradicted Pompeo, writing on Twitter that China ""may"" have been responsible for the attack. ""The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of...discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!),"" Mr. Trump wrote in two tweets, tagging Pompeo and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. However, Senator Marco Rubio, the acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter that he agreed with Pompeo. ""Increasingly clear that Russian intelligence conducted the gravest cyber intrusion in our history The process of determining its extent & assessing the damage is underway Remediation will take time & significant resources Our response must be proportional but significant,"" Rubio said. It may take months before the U.S. and other nations and some businesses can determine the extent of the damage done by the brazen attack, which went undetected for months. Sources told CBS News it is believed to be the largest cyber espionage campaign in U.S. history, and it's not over. ""This was really an attack of massive scale,"" Microsoft's president Brad Smith told CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge. The Kremlin has denied any involvement. Smith said the attack spans at least eight countries, with 80% of the targets in the U.S., including many of the company's clients. Targets included the State, Energy, Treasury and Homeland Security departments. ""This attack is still taking place. The industry is scrambling, people in government are scrambling to get it under control, but it's not under control yet,"" he said. Among the concerns: that the breach at the Treasury Department may have exposed taxpayer information. ""The impact is extraordinary,"" said former FBI operative Eric O'Neill. ""Any information of yours ... may have been compromised by very sophisticated attackers."" Officials say the tactics are similar to other large-scale attacks blamed on Russia. But investigators can't rule out other foreign adversaries. Smith said, ""We should assume that the number of victims is going to increase."" ""This is a bit like a natural disaster,"" he said. Sources say the hackers may have roamed free in unclassified systems and impersonated high-level officials to gain access to classified information. The hackers made their move at least as early as March and remained undetected until last week. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office in just over a month, said in a statement this week the intrusions were ""a matter of great concern"" and pledged to impose ""substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks.""",20,1.90922076505773,2.0191505127028386,-0.10992974764510866,16

The government's top cybersecurity agency says the hack compromised critical federal infrastructure, and according to reports, the breach struck at least seven government agencies — including the Department of Energy, which maintains the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and operates the Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico. In a statement, the department said there is so far no evidence the hack impacted nuclear weapons security. However, cybersecurity experts warn the damage done to the government's digital systems may take a long time to reverse. ""It's going to take a while for our forensic cyber sleuths to find out where this attack is, where the Russians have gotten their tentacles in,"" said former Principle Deputy Undersecretary for Homeland Intelligence Jack Thomas Tomarchio. U.S. officials call the hack ""highly complex"" and a ""grave risk."" Tomarchio worries the full extent of the damage has not been realized. ""We don't have an easy fix here,"" he said. ""I would say if you look at it as a hemorrhage, the hemorrhage is probably still happening."" The hackers made their move at least as early as March and remained undetected until last week. They had broken into SolarWinds, a Texas-based software company, that served government agencies and many Fortune 500 companies. Officials now say they managed to infect networks using other methods. Sources tell CBS News that President Trump has been briefed on the attack, but so far has made no public comments about it. Some lawmakers are calling on Mr. Trump's administration to act now. ""In this setting, not to have the White House aggressively speaking out and protesting and taking punitive action is really, really quite extraordinary,"" Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney told the Washington Post on SiriusXM. Despite what U.S. officials are saying, Vladimir Putin's government denies involvement.

But he sounded the alarm on China, calling it the country's ""greatest adversary."" Beijing, he said, is willing to use blackmail, bribery and covert and overt influence to ensure the U.S. enacts laws favorable to Chinese interests. While Mr. Biden was projected the winner of the presidential election on November 7 as he cleared the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House, the formal start of his transition was delayed due to the General Services Administration's (GSA) decision not to swiftly ascertain him as the likely winner of the election. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said at the time it would not have contact with Mr. Biden's transition team until notified by the head of the GSA, delaying the president-elect's access to the President's Daily Brief, a daily summary of intelligence that contains the nation's most sensitive information. The GSA has since kicked off the formal transition process, and Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris began receiving the daily brief on Monday. Ratcliffe declined to say whether Mr. Biden and Harris have asked for intelligence on any specific topics, but said his office has ""afforded every request."" While Mr. Biden has begun shaping his national security, foreign policy and economic teams, and announced those who will serve in key White House roles, Mr. Trump has yet to concede and instead continues to allege the presidential election was rife with fraud. Numerous state and federal courts, however, have rejected claims of fraud raised by the president's campaign, and more than three dozen states have certified their election results. Pressed on whether intelligence shows any foreign adversary or criminal group had the ability to change the result of the election, Ratcliffe indicated it does not. ""Not that we've been able to determine,"" he said. ""Now at this point in time, we're still analyzing all of the intelligence."" Ratcliffe, a former Republican congressman from Texas, also noted that voter fraud is an area covered more by agencies such as the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and the FBI. ""I can't tell you the specific information that I give the president,"" he said. ""But voter fraud is not an issue for the intelligence community, per se. That's a domestic law enforcement issue."" In the run-up to the November general election, top national security and intelligence officials, including Ratcliffe, warned of possible foreign interference in the electoral contest. Days before voters headed to the polls November 3, Ratcliffe appeared alongside FBI Director Chris Wray to warn of efforts by Iran and Russia to try to compromise the election, including by sending threatening emails to voters in Florida, and said the countries had obtained some voter registration data. In addition to Iran and Russia, the Trump administration also warned of attempts by China to interfere. In an op-ed published by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Ratcliffe called China ""national security threat No. 1"" and revealed it is targeting members of Congress with six times the frequency of Russia and 12 times the frequency of Iran. ""They want laws and policies out of the United States that are favorable to China,"" Ratcliffe told CBS News. ""And what they're really trying to do is through blackmail, through bribery, through overt and covert influence, trying to make sure that only laws that are favorable to China are passed."" Ratcliffe said he was ""troubled"" by what he has seen in his post as director of national intelligence, and it drove him to brief both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, ""which they found surprising and troubling."" ""We need to recognize China for the threat that they are. It's the greatest threat that this country has faced since World War II. It's our greatest challenge,"" he said. ""Every generation has a challenge — Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, the Iron Curtain. This generation's challenge is China's intent to replace the United States as the world's superpower."" Delivering a message to Mr. Biden's team, Ratcliffe called China the nation's ""greatest adversary."" ""They have threatened the U.S. way of life,"" he said. ""We've seen that with COVID, that is a result of the actions of the Chinese Communist Party. Americans' lives have already been impacted irreparably as a result of China's actions. They're just beginning. It's going to get worse.""",20,2.464400613317382,2.5727932252048893,-0.10839261188750715,29

CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell sat down with Dan Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana who served as President Donald Trump's first Director of National Intelligence. Coats said that when it comes to foreign countries meddling in U.S. politics, he's most concerned about Russia during what he's calling the Super Bowl of elections this year. The intelligence community concluded in 2017 that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign involving covert intelligence operations and overt propaganda to undermine faith in the 2016 U.S. election. ""They're the New England Patriots of messing with elections. I think they do it better than anybody else,"" Coats said. A nod to the Pats' two decades of dominance and six Super Bowl titles?

""Iran and Russia have taken specific actions to influence public opinion relating to our elections,"" he said. The feds believe the two countries are weaponizing voter information. They also said Iran has already sent emails meant to intimidate voters. ""They hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy,"" Ratcliffe said. Democratic voters in four states, including Florida, have received threatening email messages.

(KDKA) -- Top intelligence leaders announced that both Iran and Russia have attempted to compromise the 2020 election. ""Know that our election systems are resilient,"" said Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe on Wednesday night. A strong message out the gate from Ratcliffe in a rare press briefing where he said part of the agency's role in the election is to let voters know what information is true and false. ""We would like to alert the public that we have identified that two foreign actors, Iran and Russia, have taken specific action to influence public opinion when it comes to our election,"" Ratcliffe said. According to intelligence leaders, both countries obtained U.S. voter registration information. During the investigation, agents tracked spoofed emails, false videos and threatening messages from the group Proud Boys back to Iran. ""We are not going to tolerate foreign interference in our elections or any criminal activity that threatens the sanctity of your vote or public confidence in the outcome of the election,"" said FBI Director Chris Wray. Both directors said the activity was caught quickly by the FBI and DHS, and the United States will impose costs on any foreign country that interferes with the election.

2020-10-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-emails-florida-alaska-arizona-no-evidence-breaches/,3 states targeted in Iranian email scheme report no evidence of breaches,"One day after top U.S. officials said Iran and Russia obtained some voter registration data, which Iran then used to send a recent spate of threatening emails to voters, officials in three states targeted in the email scheme say their voter databases have not been compromised. Hundreds of Democratic voters in Florida, Alaska and Arizona received threatening emails Tuesday and Wednesday claiming to have come from the far-right group The Proud Boys, which has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights advocacy group. The emails, which were routed through servers in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Estonia and Moldova to obscure their origin, included threats to ""come after"" voters unless they voted for President Trump. Some of the emails included the recipients' home addresses and other personal information. Others included a link to a video showing a computer user appearing to access voters' registration information to fraudulently complete absentee ballots used by Americans overseas. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that Iran had sent spoof emails ""designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump."" He did not directly reference the emails spoofing Proud Boys accounts. While Ratcliffe confirmed Iran and Russia had obtained voter registration information, he did not elaborate on how the two nations were able to acquire the data, raising questions as to whether systems had been breached or if the information was compiled through publicly available means. ""This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy,"" Ratcliffe said. On Thursday, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) issued a joint advisory stating that Russia had targeted the networks of dozens of state, local and tribal governments since late September, and successfully stole data from at least two of them as of October 1. The agencies warned that some of the networks might house election-related data, but said there is ""no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been compromised."" Officials from elections offices in the three states targeted by the spoofed Proud Boys emails told CBS News there have been no breaches to their voter rolls. Varying degrees of voter registration information is considered public record in all three states. Mark Ard, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of State, said the emails had targeted voters in multiple counties but there ""has been no breach to Florida's Voter Registration database."" Gail Fenumiai, Alaska's director of the Division of Elections, said the office ""has no evidence from the FBI that the state's voter registration systems have been compromised."" Sophia Solis, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of State, said Arizona's voter database ""is secure and not affected by incidents reported nationally."" Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, an email security company that analyzes billions of emails a day, said the company identified 3,000 emails sent to corporate and organizational clients as it researched the campaign. DeGrippo said the messages were primarily sent on Tuesday and Wednesday, and revealed that Proofpoint found some of the emails had been routed through servers in Moldova, a detail that was not previously known. DeGrippo said ""a large percentage of these emails were sent to .edu addresses,"" a detail she said is in line with previous Iranian state-sponsored activities. ""Iran is obsessed with higher education and getting access into higher education institutions. They do campaigns constantly, and they have been doing them against higher education in a concerted effort for probably two years,"" DeGrippo said, citing the so-called ""Silent Librarian"" campaign that targeted hundreds of universities. A spokesman for the University of Florida told CBS News on Tuesday that the emails were sent to 183 accounts on the university's network. She said the use of email for voter intimidation, and the scale of the campaign, was unusual for a state-sponsored operation. ""A hundred is considered very big for a state-sponsored actor. A hundred emails out of a state-sponsored actor is crazy, but the difference here is that this is not [a malware] threat. This is social engineering and disinformation,"" DeGrippo said. ""They're not spreading malware with this. They're … trying to get people to take a physical action of some kind out in the world and trying to intimidate."" A spokesperson for Google told CBS News that 25,000 of the emails were sent to Gmail users, and 90% were blocked by the service's automated spam filter. The company said it referred the matter to the FBI. Iran denied targeting American voters. Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesperson for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, tweeted Wednesday that ""Iran does not interfere in other country's elections. The world has been witnessing US' own desperate public attempts to question the outcome of its own elections at the highest level."" Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, told CBS News most voter registration information is public and available online, and added that he has seen no evidence that voter registration databases were compromised. ""My personal sense is that the emails were much more about lashing out at America, trying to influence our election process and have people lose confidence in that process, rather than being about specific candidates,"" he said. Alperovitch, now the chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, called the speed with which the intelligence community publicly attributed the email campaign to Iran ""unprecedented."" Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio said Wednesday that the intelligence community's determination that Iran was behind the campaign left him feeling exposed. ""This is just another news story, a cyberattack, but when this dust settles, the people who are in danger are going to be me and my guys, you know, nobody's going to provide security for us,"" Tarrio said. Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert at The Wilson Center, said the direct-emailing effort is the first she has seen from any adversary and said it indicates Iran is ""stepping up its game."" Such campaigns from foreign actors like Russia and Iran, she said, are aimed at destabilizing the U.S. without expending many resources. ""I don't think any disinformation actor is getting into this game thinking they're actually going to change votes,"" she said. ""Chaos and division in America is much more valuable to them in many ways."" The U.S. intelligence community and national security officials have warned that Russia, China and Iran would attempt to use cyber capabilities or foreign influence to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, including by using disinformation to sow chaos and division among U.S. voters. This month, the Department of Homeland Security warned in a homeland threat assessment Iran would continue ""to use online influence operations to increase societal tensions in the"" U.S. ""Tehran most likely considers the current U.S. administration a threat to the regime's stability,"" the department warned. ""Iran's critical messaging of the U.S. president almost certainly will continue throughout 2020."" The intelligence community has also made a series of disclosures to the American public about foreign threats to the election, as well as steps voters can take to mitigate those threats. In August, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director Bill Evanina detailed the candidate preferences of foreign actors, with Russia trying to ""denigrate"" Joe Biden and China preferring Mr. Trump wins reelection. Iran, he said, ""seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections."" ""Iran's efforts along these lines probably will focus on online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content,"" he said. ""Tehran's motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump's reelection would result in a continuation of U.S. pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change."" CISA also this week rolled out a ""rumor control"" web page designed to educate voters about potential areas of disinformation, and Chris Krebs, the agency's director, urged voters on Twitter on Thursday to remember ""your vote is secure and we're on watch."" ""The American voter is the last line of defense in election security,"" he tweeted. ""Keep calm and vote on.""",20,1.0511521402936985,1.3968940426282281,-0.3457419023345296,29

A 50-page indictment unsealed in federal court in Pittsburgh details the computer intrusions and malware attacks mounted over the past five years by the members of Russia's military intelligence agency, known as the GRU. The Justice Department described the hacking campaign as the ""most disruptive and destructive series of computer attacks"" ever attributed to one group. ""No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously or irresponsibly as Russia, wantonly causing unprecedented damage to pursue small tactical advantages and to satisfy fits of spite,"" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said in a statement announcing the charges. According to the indictment, the Russian intelligence officers deployed ""destructive malware"" beginning around at least November 2015 and continuing through at least October 2019 in support of Russia's effort to undermine or retaliate against foreign nations and organizations around the world. The six defendants allegedly are behind the malware attacks on Ukraine's electric power grid in 2015 and 2016, as well as hack-and-leak efforts targeting the 2017 French elections and President Emmanuel Macron's political party. The indictment accuses the Russians of hacking into computers that supported the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, after Russian athletes were banned from competing because of the country's doping scandal, and deploying destructive malware known as NotPetya, which led to nearly $1 billion in losses to U.S. businesses whose computers were infected. The malware infected computers at hospitals and medical facilities in Pennsylvania, a FedEx subsidiary and a large U.S. drug manufacturer. The Justice Department said the cyberattacks caused damage to computer networks around the world, including in France, Georgia, the Netherlands, South Korea, Ukraine, the U.S. and the U.K. While the GRU has been found by U.S. intelligence agencies to be involved in the efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the indictment does not include charges relating to the 2020 presidential election. The individuals charged are: Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko, 32; Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov, 35; Pavel Valeryevich Frolov, 28; Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, 29; Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko, 27; and Petr Nikolayevich Pliskin, 32.

2020-10-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-spies-operation-ghost-stories-fbi-declassified/,"Russian spies living among us: Inside the FBI's ""Operation Ghost Stories""","Through never-before-seen footage and in-depth interviews, ""The FBI Declassified"" takes you inside the minds of heroic federal agents and analysts as they reveal how they solved some of the biggest cases of their careers. Watch Tuesdays at 10/9c on CBS. Produced by Resa Matthews and Anthony Venditti Around 2000, FBI agents learned there were multiple sets of Russian spies in the United States, posing as Americans. ""Operation Ghost Stories was probably the largest FBI counterintelligence investigation in history,"" says Alan Kohler, assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. The spies were trained in Russia to assimilate into everyday American life by getting married, obtaining jobs and raising families, while also sending encoded messages back home, the FBI agents say. The spies lived double lives. For more than a decade, FBI agents bugged the spies' homes, followed their travels, and ultimately cracked their secret communications network. ""They went to school with Americans. They went to July 4th parties with their neighbors,"" says Kohler. ""And never once did anybody suspect they would be Russian spies."" Counterintelligence agents say the Russian spies got jobs they believed would allow them access to people in powerful positions. Their mission was to gather sensitive information that would be sent back to Moscow, which could potentially be used to damage U.S. national security. Every move they made was monitored. FBI agents recorded several exchanges where the Russians passed large amounts of cash to each other in public places – to help finance their operations – and one instance where $60,000 was buried at a highway rest stop, to be retrieved later. Could the FBI stop the spies before sensitive secrets got into the hands of the Russian government? ""You're always wondering, what are you missing?"" says Ricci. ""Do they have contacts? Do they have access to classified information? … The risks…were astronomical."" Todd Shelton | FBI Special Agent: When we first realized that we may have … Russian intelligence officers … operating in the United States … that became a critical threat that we needed to address. Todd Shelton: We look to use every tool in the FBI investigative toolbox. Wiretaps, electronic monitoring, intercepts of electronic communication … to learn … exactly what we were facing. By 2000, the New York office of the FBI was leading an unprecedented investigation into Russian intelligence agents living in the United States potentially threatening national security. Todd Shelton: Initially we focused on … Juan Lazaro and Vicky Peláez, who are living in Yonkers, New York. … We had Michael Zottoli and Patricia Mills, who had operated for a long time in the state of Washington and relocated to suburban Washington, D.C. We had Donald Heathfield and Tracey Foley, who were working and operating in and around Boston. … We identified Richard and Cynthia Murphy, who were then living in Montclair, New Jersey. Todd Shelton: The Murphys had two children born in the United States. Leon Panetta | Former CIA director: Their children have no idea. … Keeping the children in the dark about what they're doing is a way to make sure that you keep their identity as secure as possible. The spies' identities, or backstory – known as a legend – was determined long before they set foot on American soil. Maria Ricci | FBI Special Agent: I don't have firsthand knowledge on when Richard and Cindy met … and became a husband and wife couple. … I do know that traditionally … trained intelligence officers … are paired up … at Headquarters back in Moscow. Their new identity required new IDs and credentials. Todd Shelton: Richard and Cynthia Murphy are both fabricated people. They had a forged U.S. birth certificate from the state of Pennsylvania and the state of New York, respectively. Todd Shelton: We were able to find some of the original documentation … through clandestine searches. Todd Shelton: The intelligence work -- it's not all James Bond and sports cars. It's nitty-gritty analysis. How did they learn how to do this? Where did they get the documentation? The inks were studied. The papers were studied. With fake IDs and their backstory memorized, their assignments were to blend in with Americans. Maria Ricci: When they first come to the United States, they're armed only with a birth certificate. They had to build a life here. Maria Ricci: Richard Murphy began his career as a computer consultant. … He went to New School and got a degree … in public policy. And then he ended up becoming a stay-at-home dad. His wife, Cindy, she was a financial planner and then ultimately got her MBA at Columbia University. Maria Ricci: This is the business card from Marea Financial … This is Cindy Murphy's Columbia University ID card. Todd Shelton: Cynthia Murphy … really takes on a prominent role in the intelligence activities of that couple. Her work at a financial services industry gave them intelligence of value to the economists in Russia. Todd Shelton: In economic circles, financial circles, social circles, if you're looking for ways to show civil discontent, you might want a pulse of what's going on in the country at the time. Todd Shelton: And … her attendance to Columbia was a huge opportunity for gaining access to the up and coming professionals in the U.S. Maria Ricci: Over the course of the investigation after observing and listening to them for so long … they were constantly talking about how to gain access to people in political circles and policy making circles. Todd Shelton: One of the things that makes intelligence officers so lethal is that they … get a significant amount of training in how to develop and recruit people, how to spot and assess weaknesses in people. Maria Ricci: Cindy Murphy was … reporting on people who were interested in potentially obtaining jobs with the CIA. That was of significance to us. Also, of significance were the spies the Russians had placed in Boston: Tracey Foley and Donald Heathfield. Maria Ricci: Donald Heathfield and Tracey Foley had two children, two boys, who were born in Canada. Todd Shelton: Tracey Foley was a realtor. Alex Coon: I was managing a real estate company here in the Boston area, and Tracey Foley worked for me. … She was probably one of the hardest working and most competent agents that I had. Todd Shelton: We saw a number of things develop with Heathfield and Foley that caused us to be concerned. Todd Shelton: Heathfield had attended the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. After graduating he remained active in the alumni circles. He really used that as a platform to gain access to people that might ultimately be in positions of authority. Craig Sandler: I met Donald Heathfield … at the Kennedy School. … If there was a deep interest in … setting public policy, or … running the government, those are the people you found there. Craig Sandler: My impression of Don is that he was … professionally very well put together. He had an interesting mind and he was interesting to talk to. Todd Shelton: Heathfield had developed his own company called Future Map … in which he had a software program that he thought could help with strategic forecasting. … He would market this to people that he thought might be interested in it, large corporations, the military, defense. Agents suspected that Heathfield's software was nothing more than a ploy to get close to someone inside the U.S. government. Todd Shelton: It caused him to have access to a variety of people who would indeed have the types of information we believe that the Russians would value. … One of the people was a member of the U.S. government with information related to nuclear technology. … We knew that Heathfield was trying to gather information about how one would join the State Department. Maria Ricci: We got information that he was in contact with somebody who could potentially be significant to the Russians and a problem for the United States. … With every step that they got closer, that risk became greater. Alan Kohler | FBI Supervisory Special Agent: In 2004 … the spies … became more aggressive. … The Russians … wanted them to be more productive. They wanted them to target people with more value. That's when the FBI's pursuit of this Russian spy network suddenly took an alarming turn. Maria Ricci: Donald Heathfield … in Boston … was getting close to people who were nuclear experts. … We worked very hard at ensuring that those relationships did not progress. Maria Ricci: Sometimes it was a question of putting somebody else in his path that would be of interest to him. Sometimes it was just a question of maneuvering a little bit. It wasn't long before the FBI discovered a vital new link in the spy network: a Russian operative named Christopher Metsos had been dispatched from Moscow to assist the spies. Todd Shelton: Christopher Metsos played a critical role in providing money and items of tradecraft to the … intelligence officers … operating in the United States. ""Tradecraft"" includes the techniques, methods and technologies that a spy uses to gather intelligence. FBI agents quickly realized Christopher Metsos was sent to distribute a secret cache of money to subsidize the Russian operatives. So, the FBI followed the money. The Russians used a ""brush pass."" Todd Shelton: A brush pass would be a quick and clandestine exchange of items. Todd Shelton: In May 2004, FBI surveillance was able to document a brush pass … between Metsos and the Russian government … at the Forest Hills, Long Island Railroad Station. Todd Shelton: A credentialed, diplomat of the Russian Federation is moving down the stairs while Metsos is moving up the stairs. Each man carries an identical bag, which they exchange midpoint on the stairs. … Inside the bag, we believe to be a significant amount of U.S. currency. Alan Kohler: That was concerning to us because it -- it let us know that the Russians felt like they could freely travel into the United States and conduct operational activity right underneath our noses. Todd Shelton: Now, Christopher Metsos, flush with the currency he's just received from the Russian government, moves to a restaurant in Queens later that same day. There, Metsos met with Richard Murphy -- the spy who studied public policy and lived with his wife and children in New Jersey. Maria Ricci: They walked together to a restaurant in Sunnyside and they sat at the table by the window and they were there for approximately two hours. … We recorded it. We also had FBI agents … in the restaurant next to them. At the table, Metsos passed Murphy $175,000. And there was another $60,000 that came with a very specific set of instructions. Todd Shelton: The Russians … told Metsos to drive upstate New York and bury it. … Through a GPS device … we affixed to the rental car that Metsos was driving, we see the car go north out of New York City to a rest stop in Wurtsboro, New York. Agents quickly identified where the money was hidden. Todd Shelton: A small number of agents … went up to the rest stop and … Digging down a short way, they found … bundles of money that were buried in what is known … as a dead drop. Alan Kohler: A dead drop is a cache of, typically, money. It could be weapons, it could be a radio communication device that is literally buried in the ground, hidden in a hollow tree … waiting for it to be picked up by a recipient at another time. Agents re-buried the money and set up a camera. Todd Shelton: We … immediately set up a new intelligence operation where the FBI would lie in wait, to see who ultimately would come and collect that money. Back in the suburbs of New Jersey, Richard Murphy, flush with $175,000, made a plan to disperse some of the cash to a fellow Russian operative in New York City. Maria Ricci: Richard Murphy … had an operational cell phone. And fortunately for us … we were already compromising that cell phone. He utilized this cell phone to … set up a brush pass in Columbus Circle. In June 2004, the FBI staked out Columbus Circle and watched as Murphy tried to find the other operative, whom he had never met. Ed Foley | FBI Special Agent: In the video, you see … Richard Murphy go up to a -- a gentleman. Maria Ricci: Richard Murphy was supposed to say … ""Uncle Paul sends his love"" and the response was supposed to be ""Isn't it nice to be Santa Claus in May."" Ed Foley: The gentleman kind of looks at him like, you know, you're crazy. You know, I don't know what you are talking about. Maria Ricci: Richard Murphy approached a couple of people trying to locate this man. Finally, Murphy located his target, Michael Zottoli, the spy based in Washington. Maria Ricci: They walk across the street and Richard Murphy passes a bag … to Michael Zottoli … with $75,000. Witnessing these exchanges of cash was significant. Now the FBI knew how Russia was paying the spies. Alan Kohler: It wasn't transferred in from a Russian bank … it wasn't in rubles. It was just in hundred dollar bills. The next move was to figure out how the spies were communicating back and forth with headquarters, known as Center, in Moscow. Maria Ricci: One of the priorities of the squad and the team was, can we do a covert entry? Can we get into the Murphy residence and find out how they are communicating with Center? Maria Ricci: We waited until they were on vacation. … We conducted countless hours of surveillance … and determined the best way of entering the residence. Alan Kohler: As the cases grow, we're able to get more intrusive techniques. … Bugging phones, putting microphones in houses. … We go in as cleaning crew, as Con Ed. … Often we pose as what we're not. Maria Ricci: When we entered the Murphy home, one of the things we found was what we call the tradecraft box. The tradecraft box is the spies' tool kit. Maria Ricci: We found notebooks with codewords. … We found an odd piece of paper that had Alt-Control-E and then a 27-character password … And we found a bunch of floppy disks. … Initially when we looked at the discs, they appeared to be blank. Until a prompt for that 27-character password appeared. Maria Ricci: We inserted the 27 characters. It was a little bit of trial and error … but ultimately, we figured out the order. And we were able to enter the system. Todd Shelton: Immediately when he hit the enter key, a window came up. Whoop! [gestures with his hands]. And they knew that they were into something big. Not only had the FBI found a way into the spy ring, they made an extraordinary discovery: how the operatives communicated by embedding hidden messages in images. Todd Shelton: This is a sophisticated software system designed to … hide digital messages. Maria Ricci: It was a total game changer. … From that point … we were able to read every message Richard and Cindy Murphy sent to Center, and every message Center sent back to Richard and Cindy Murphy. Todd Shelton: For the first time, rather than being on the outside, looking in … we're reading in almost real time exactly what's happening. Alan Kohler: So, we knew where to go, where to set up. But just months later, a potential arrest across the border in Canada threatened to undo the entire FBI operation. Todd Shelton: Sometimes, even the most sophisticated of intelligence operations can be undone by just some stroke of bad luck. Alan Kohler: We were racing against the unknown. We didn't know when or if the Russians were going to make a decision to pull the intelligence officers back, but we had to plan accordingly. In early 2006, just as the FBI was closing in on the American spy ring, the surprise discovery of a Russian operative by Canadian intelligence threatened to shut down the FBI's investigation. Alan Kohler: Our concern was the Russians would worry about … the safety of the … spies … that were based in the United States and would start to pull them back to Russia. Maria Ricci: What do we do if every single one of … them … starts making a run for the border? If we wanted to arrest them, could we? The FBI had advance warning that an arrest in Canada could take place any day. So, agents pulled an all-nighter, preparing a criminal complaint with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York to arrest the spies Todd Shelton: There was a serious sense of urgency that we needed to be prepared. As it turned out, the Russian spy in Canada did not get arrested until months later. In June 2006, the Washington-based spies Michael Zottoli and his wife showed up in New York. Maria Ricci: They don't do what normal tourists do. They do not go to see a Yankees game. They do not go to see a Broadway show. Instead, they go to Home Depot and they buy a shovel. … That was a very strong indicator to us that his next stop was going to be Wurtsboro, New York. Their hunch was dead on. They drove straight to that rest stop north of New York City, where two years earlier that stash of cash had been buried. Maria Ricci: We had cameras there, and so we were able to capture Michael Zottoli going into the woods and digging up $60,000. … It's amazing. After the Canadian spy was arrested, Russian intelligence did not end up recalling any of the U.S. based operatives. But something did change: Christopher Metsos, the spy handler, disappeared. Maria Ricci: As a result of the arrest in Canada … Christopher Metsos never came back to the U.S. after that. With Metsos now out of the picture, the Russians needed a new way to distribute money. The solution? Have an official Russian diplomat working in New York hand it over to one of the spies. Todd Shelton: In June of 2009, on the North White Plains station of Metro North Railroad, we see the … New Jersey conspirator … Richard Murphy, conduct another brush pass with a Russian diplomat. Alan Kohler: When they were being sent instructions on where to meet, we were reading those instructions at the same time. So, we knew where to go, where to set up. Ed Foley: That was my favorite location of all the meets, because … it really challenged us. There were cameras everywhere. … it was like a movie shoot. Ed Foley: We saturated the area with … multiple covert vehicles, rental vehicles, people out with dogs in the park. Todd Shelton: We saw … Richard Murphy … take a circuitous route to access the station … which we believe was specifically to help him identify any surveillance that might be following him. You'll see him looking around. Ed Foley [in tunnel at train station]: You see him standing. … He checks his watch. He takes a deep breath. He tugs on his collar. And then he performs the act. Todd Shelton: They don't even stop on the stairs. It really was a pretty seamless transition for such a large package. The FBI learned Richard Murphy had in his possession $300,000 in cash and a flash drive containing a new covert communication system. Alan Kohler: The brush pass in 2009 between Richard Murphy and another … Russian diplomat from the Russian mission … was actually quite significant for us. Maria Ricci: It established that there was direct contact between the … intelligence officer … and … an official of the Russian government. The FBI later followed Richard Murphy to Brooklyn, where he again met fellow Russian spy Michael Zottoli. Maria Ricci: Richard Murphy was going to pass a $150,000 … and the flash drive containing the new covert communication system … to Michael Zottoli. Maria Ricci: Instead of doing a quick meeting, they bought a cup of coffee … and they sat on a park bench for two hours. Ed Foley: What's supposed to be a quick meeting … lasted quite a while. So long that the battery on the old mini camera started flashing … I'm thinking I'm not going to get the shot. Todd Shelton: Near the conclusion of that meeting, we see Murphy reach into his backpack. He removes a … parcel, placing it into the bag and another small object, which we believe to have been that thumb drive. … And he hands those to Michael Zottoli. … Now we have another key link in the chain that we can ultimately use to forge a criminal charge of conspiracy. As the FBI prepared charges to finally arrest the Russian spies, there was yet another surprise. Alan Kohler: In 2009 a new breed of … intelligence officers … arrived in the United States, and that was in the form of Anna Chapman and Mikhail Semenko. Todd Shelton: We saw this as a new threat. These were legitimate people with legitimate access to the United States. Maria Ricci: Mikhail Semenko, he started out on a student visa. … Really smart kid. He knew five languages fluently. Todd Shelton: He's in Seton Hall University. Again, another flag for us, a tie to an educational institution that provides fertile ground for spotting and assessing. Todd Shelton: Anna Chapman -- young, hip, pretty. … She was a real estate professional. She opens a company called Property Finders. … it allows her to mix and mingle with people of wealth who may want to be looking for real estate in New York. Maria Ricci: She was networking and going to a lot of parties and meeting a lot of people. … and I think she was probably going to stay in New York and be part of the financial center. This new generation of spies also came with a new set of tools. Todd Shelton: Anna Chapman … has a piece of tradecraft -- a dedicated laptop computer specifically designed for her to load in intelligence reports, which could be transmitted to a corresponding laptop in the possession of a Russian diplomat, who also was an intelligence officer. Maria Ricci: The video that you see is her shopping inside the department store. And … the Russian intelligence officer … being outside. … He … pretended to be on the phone. … She was bouncing from department to department. And … her laptop was in that red, white and black bag that she was carrying, and his laptop was in a briefcase. Maria Ricci: And when those two computers were within a certain … proximity of each other, they would … be able to send a quick burst message back and forth. Todd Shelton: We documented multiple occasions where this electronic exchange had happened. This latest Russian technology shut the door on the FBI's ability to crack the new spies' communications. Maria Ricci: We weren't able to … obtain those messages. Todd Shelton: We see the change in the tactics being employed … with Semenko and Chapman. Concerned that national security could be at greater risk, intelligence agencies had to act fast. Leon Panetta: I was very impressed with … the fact that … we knew what the hell was going on here. But at the same time -- it raised a lot of questions in my mind about how many of these people do we not know about. Alan Kohler: In counterintelligence, nothing happens by accident. … Everything has to happen for a reason. By 2009, the FBI had been watching the Russian spy network for nearly a decade. The Bureau worried about potential access to nuclear secrets, government officials and efforts to recruit new spies. Now the FBI's concern grew with the arrival of that new generation of operatives. Todd Shelton: Mikhail Semenko and Anna Chapman, both … Russian nationals … had entered the U.S. with the hidden job of conducting intelligence work on behalf of the Russian government. … They were younger … that provided potential new sources of access. Todd Shelton: They have credentials that'll hold up to scrutiny. And it's a new threat that we sought to counter. Alan Kohler: The decision was made that we were gonna take down the network in 2010. Alan Kohler: There were numerous challenges that we faced to make this happen. There were political issues. … We had just hit the reset button with Russia. So, Russia was our friend again. Todd Shelton: We were fully aware that this was not a typical case. And the repercussions of our action could impact U.S. foreign policy. Todd Shelton: There was a briefing conducted with the then-director of the CIA, Leon Panetta. Leon Panetta: My Russian section at the CIA … asked the FBI to come over and brief me. … They described what the situation was. … And then they showed me some of the surveillance they were doing, to kind of prove the point. … ""We have verified that they are planted agents by Russia and that they continue to maintain close contact with the Russians."" Todd Shelton: It was a head spinning time for us. … Once the decision was made to arrest, and we started to move forward in the planning process, one of the key things that came about was identifying … a window in which to act. Alan Kohler: The summer of 2010 … specifically that last week in June, was really going to be the only time that we anticipated having all the … spies … in the country together. Todd Shelton: If we miss that opportunity, it would be several months before we again found ourselves with all the U.S.-based … Russian intelligence officers … currently in the United States. … Everything really hinged on the final weekend. That weekend, President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev were both attending international summits in Canada. Alan Kohler: The last few days before the arrest was kind of a crazy time. … All the officers involved in headquarters went up 24/7 on all of our subjects. We had airplanes following them around. Ed Foley: We used just about our entire physical surveillance cadre. … And it was the full court press. The FBI had prepared criminal charges against the original four couples -- now they needed to get charges on the newest operatives: Anna Chapman and Mikhail Semenko. Agents in New York and D.C. initiated what's called a ""false flag."" Alan Kohler: Essentially, a false flag is where an FBI undercover agent poses as a Russian intelligence officer and gives the target a task. Todd Shelton: An overt act which we can document … an intelligence officer … as working on behalf of the Russian government. On Saturday, June 26, 2010, an undercover FBI agent, posing as a Russian official, met with Mikhail Semenko in Washington, D.C. Todd Shelton: The undercover agent gave him $5,000 wrapped in a newspaper and tells him that I need you to … load a dead drop … in a suburban Virginia park. Todd Shelton: Semenko takes the money, and the following day the FBI documents him through video surveillance. … He crawls down underneath the bridge and slides this newspaper back deep into the rafters of the bridge and then leaves. Meanwhile in New York City, another FBI undercover agent also playing a Russian government official, met with Anna Chapman at a coffee shop. First, he got Chapman to admit that she was using her laptop to communicate with the Russian government; then to his surprise, she gave it to him. Todd Shelton: That was a great break. She's handing over the evidence, identifying what it was and how she's used it. That's huge. To further strengthen the case, the FBI agent then asked Chapman to pass off a fake passport to another operative. Alan Kohler: Chapman … accepted the offer to hand a fake passport to somebody else. And Semenko agreed to put some money underneath a bridge in Virginia. And that was enough for us to get the complaint and the charges against both of them. But those summits in Canada put the arrests on hold. Todd Shelton: It was the request of the administration that we delay our arrest until the U.S. President was back in the United States and the Russian president was away from North American airspace. Ed Foley: Sunday, June 27th, 2010, I'll never forget. It was hot. I was in New Jersey … covering the Murphys. … We've come so far in 10 years and we don't need any screw ups at this point. Maria Ricci: We were waiting for the go ahead in Montclair. … This was the moment. This was the moment that we've been working for, for so long. … So, there was a ton of pressure on us. Todd Shelton: As things unfold during the day … we're in close communication with all of the offices. Todd Shelton: That night, just before 11:00, the Boston conspirator Donald Heathfield had plane tickets to depart from Logan with one of his children to a European visit. So, we had a very short window in which to react. Alan Kohler: I was very concerned that it was going to fall apart. Alan Kohler: The moment of the arrests was … the moment we've all been waiting for … for years. … Decades. Todd Shelton: We were in the Strategic Information Operation Center at FBI headquarters. … As soon as we know the Russian president is out of North American airspace, the U.S. president is back in the United States … we … move to affect the arrests. Maria Ricci: There's like this incredible surge of emotion coming from all directions. This amazing excitement about accomplishing something this massive after so long. Alex Coon: I got a call … it was around 9:30 at night on my phone and … the person on the other line said … ""Are you Alex Coon, the manager?"" And I said, ""Yeah, absolutely."" And they said, ""Do you know that Tracey Ann Foley, who works for you, was just arrested for being a Russian spy?"" … I – I - I thought it was a prank. Craig Sandler: A friend of mine … said, ""Craig, do you know a guy named Don Heathfield?"" … ""Sure. He's a good guy. Why?"" … And my friend said, ""Well, he's been arrested as a Russian spy."" … I can't really properly describe what a strange feeling it is to have everything that you think you know about a person be upended. In Montclair, New Jersey, neighbors of Richard and Cynthia Murphy were also stunned. Elizabeth Lapin: The night of the arrests, I have to say, everybody was in the streets. It was almost like a carnival. Stanley Skolnik: Crowds were gathering. There were cars parked everywhere. FBI, police. … Nobody could possibly have understood that there was, going on in this neighborhood, a spy ring. It was completely a shock. Ed Foley: When you're working somebody for so long, you kind of get to know them. … The Murphys were my favorite. We watched their kids be born. Maria Ricci: They were … toddlers when I first joined the case and I watched them grow up into really great, beautiful young ladies. … [emotional] Those two little girls, definitely -- definitely impacted me. [pauses] That was hard. … In a lot of ways, I feel like I [laughs] knew them better than I know some members of my own family. With the 10 spies in custody, talks quickly began between the U.S. and Russia about a spy swap. Four western spies were being held in Russian prisons. Now the U.S. wanted them freed. Leon Panetta: I called my Russian counterpart, a guy named Fradkov. … And I said, ""So we've picked up these 10 individuals. …They're your people."" … He said, ""Yes, they are my people."" Everybody in the room kind of said, ""Wow!"" You know, he's admitting that … these were spies. … From that point … it became a negotiation. Leon Panetta: We agreed to set up an exchange in Vienna. After being interrogated, the spies, along with most of their children, were put on the same plane. Only the sons of the New York spies, who were older, were allowed to stay in the U.S. Todd Shelton: Up in the front of the plane, there were members of U.S. intelligence. Farther back in the plane were all the … Russians. After secretly and silently watching the Russian spies for years, the agents could now chat with them. Alan Kohler: Some of them were very sullen. Some of them were very philosophical about it. Todd Shelton: Richard Murphy was frustrated. I think that … he … thought that he was a victim of someone else's mistake. Todd Shelton: Michael Zottoli seemed very easygoing. … One of the FBI people on the plane … asked him, you know, ""How long would you have stayed?"" And Zottoli's response was, ""I would have stayed forever. I mean, I liked it there. We had a great life."" Todd Shelton: As an intelligence official, the number of opportunities you have to talk directly to your adversary … that's not much. … It really was a surreal experience. Alan Kohler: There was a certain feeling of closure … talking with them and seeing them and knowing this was it. Leon Panetta: Russia was delivering the four individuals we wanted to the same location. And they literally passed each other on the runway. … It was right out of the movies [laughs]. Back in Russia, the spies were given a hero's welcome. Some were even rewarded with high-profile jobs working for state-run agencies. Anna Chapman launched a career in television and modeling. In the U.S., the mood was decidedly different. Leon Panetta: I don't think there's any question that … this operation protected our national security. … The whole purpose of these 10 spies was to be able to penetrate sensitive positions. Maria Ricci: A lot of people ask me about this case, and they say, ""Well, they never conducted espionage."" And my response is, if they had, that would have been the single greatest failure of my career."" My job was to ensure that they were not able to get close enough to commit espionage. Todd Shelton: If you have a well-executed counterintelligence operation, nothing's taken. Nothing's stolen. Alan Kohler: The thing about counterintelligence is we're never really going to defeat our adversaries. … All we can do … is beat them back. Todd Shelton: At FBI headquarters … we were thinking, what's the next threat? How long do we have before the Russians replace this network with another? And how are we going to get on that network and have a success similar to Ghost Stories?",20,5.567571734712214,6.854667557148991,-1.2870958224367772,20
2020-10-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/putin-russia-biden-purported-hypersonic-missile-test-new-start-nuclear-weapons-treaty/,"Putin says Russia ""used to"" Biden's ""anti-Russian rhetoric,"" as he gets a missile test for his birthday","Russian President Vladimir Putin noted on Wednesday U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's tough stance on Moscow, but voiced hope that, if elected, the former vice president might push forward talks on a new weapons agreement between the adversaries. Putin said it as he boasted of a purported successful test of a hypersonic missile. The test of the advanced hypersonic missile, if true, would be the latest in Russia's development of weapons systems intended to make their nuclear arsenal faster to deliver around the globe, and unstoppable by America's missile defense systems. ""As far as the candidate from the Democratic Party is concerned... we also see quite sharp anti-Russian rhetoric. Unfortunately, we are used to this,"" Putin said during a televised news conference on Wednesday. But he also said Biden had made encouraging remarks on New START, the last major nuclear arms treaty still in place between Moscow and Washington. That treaty is set to expire in February, and bilateral talks between the two countries have thus far yielded no agreement on a pact to replace it. ""Candidate Biden publicly said he was ready for an extension of New START or to reach a new treaty to limit strategic... weapons, and this is a very serious element of our cooperation in the future,"" said Putin. Meanwhile, he hailed Russia's apparently successfully test of a new hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile as a ""great event"" for the country. The military said that the Tsirkon missile was fired from the Admiral Gorshkov frigate in the White Sea on Tuesday morning in the Russian Arctic and successfully hit its target. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian military's General Staff, told Putin — who turned 68 on Wednesday — that it was the first time the missile had successfully struck a target at sea. ""The tasks of the launch were carried out. The test-fire was successful,"" he told Putin. Gerasimov said the missile hit its target 280 miles away in the Barents Sea and hit a speed of Mach 8 — eight times the speed of sound. Russia has in recent years touted the development of futuristic new weapons which it hopes will give it the edge in any arms race with the United States. Putin said the test-firing of Tsirkon was a ""great event not just in the life of our armed forces bur for all of Russia."" He said that such weapons, which Putin claimed have no equivalent worldwide, ""will without doubt in the long term boost the defense capabilities of our state."" The defense ministry said the plan was to equip both warships and submarines with the Tsirkon. Russia boasts of developing a number of ""invincible"" weapons that surpass existing systems and include Sarmat intercontinental missiles and Burevestnik cruise missiles. The first Avangard hypersonic missiles were put into service in December last year, according to Russian officials. The program is not without risks, and seven people were killed in an explosion at a missile test site in August 2019. Western experts linked the blast to work on the Burevestnik.",49,5.198643789244519,6.156298212763424,-0.9576544235189051,22
2020-10-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-russia-and-white-supremacy-top-dhs-first-public-threat-assessment/,"China, Russia and white supremacy top DHS' first public threat assessment","The Department of Homeland Security has concluded its first-ever ""Homeland Threat Assessment,"" a comprehensive report designed to educate the public on the largest threats facing the country. The report, first obtained by CBS News, highlights major threats posed by China and Russia and identifies white supremacists as posing the ""most persistent and lethal threat"" of all domestic violent extremist groups. In an exclusive interview, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said the report ""touches on all the major threat streams that I look at on a daily basis."" In September, a senior DHS official alleged in a whistleblower complaint that Wolf told him to withhold an intelligence notification on Russian activities because it ""made the president look bad,"" and claimed senior Trump administration officials urged analysts to downplay the threat of violent white supremacy. But Wolf told CBS News on Monday that the Homeland Threat Assessment was free from political influence. ""I am obviously aware of those complaints,"" he said. ""I think if you look at the document, Russia is mentioned somewhere in the document between 30 and 40 different times, so if we were trying to downplay Russia, we didn't do a very good job, I would say. The threat is specifically called out there when we talk about election, potential election interference, or disinformation… We are very upfront."" These are the major takeaways from the report. The report cited multiple potential threats from China, warning the country ""already poses a high cyber espionage threat to the Homeland and Beijing's cyber-attack capabilities will grow."" It also said China has been a ""particularly persistent"" source of counterfeit medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that more than 1 million FDA-prohibited COVID-19 test kits and 75,000 counterfeit masks have been seized from illicit Chinese manufacturers. The report warned that Beijing has been monitoring shortages in U.S. medical supply chains, and said China could exploit those shortages to force the government to adopt more pro-China policies. Wolf told CBS News that he believes ""the most long term strategic threat to Americans to the Homeland and really to our way of life would be the threat from China."" ""It cuts across a variety of different threats, from the cyber threats we see, from foreign influence, to supply chain security, to exploiting our academic and visa systems, foreign investment here in the U.S., trade policy violations and the like. It goes on and on and on…"" he said. ""Just across the board, threat after threat stream, we see China playing a very significant and enhanced role trying to really do the U.S. some long-term harm."" The report also highlighted Russia's efforts to influence the 2020 U.S. Presidential election by exacerbating existing social and political tensions in an effort to ""sway U.S. voter perceptions."" The report did not indicate a preference by Russia for a specific candidate, but did note an effort to undermine the campaign of Joe Biden: ""Russia uses divisive measures to disrupt the electoral process — including denigrating former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment' — as part of a broader effort to divide and destabilize America,"" the report says. Wolf told CBS News that despite foreign attempts to influence the election, he does not believe that any election infrastructure has been compromised. ""What we know right now is that none of those nation states are targeting election infrastructure, at least haven't done so successfully,"" he said. ""That is different than what we saw in 2016 at this time, leading up to the election."" The report also highlighted Russia's skill in cyber espionage and cyber attacks, warning that the nation likely has the ability to conduct attacks that would last hours to days, and is developing the capability to conduct ""more debilitating"" attacks. The report found that the most likely terrorist threat to the United States comes from ""ideologically motivated lone offenders and small groups,"" with domestic violent extremists posing the ""primary terrorist threat"" inside the U.S. Of the domestic violent extremists, the report said, ""racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists—specifically white supremacist extremists (WSEs)—will remain the most persistent and lethal threat."" White supremacist groups have killed more people than any other domestic violent extremist group, according to the report. But Wolf told CBS News that the report is ""also very clear to call out anarchist threats."" ""..if you are only looking at deaths, and you are not looking at property damage, insurance claims and all the other societal factors, and only looking at deaths, then yes, white supremacist extremists sort of lead that category,"" Wolf said. ""But as we have witnessed over the last several months, the movements and the civil unrest we have seen here inside the U.S., while maybe not lethal, certainly have lasting implications to the homeland and do serve as a threat to the homeland."" The report said that ""DHS law enforcement officers suffered over 300 separate injuries and were assaulted with sledgehammers, commercial grade fireworks, rocks, metal pipes, improvised explosive devices, and more"" as part of violence perpetrated by ""anarchist extremists."" The report touched on a number of other threats, including Iran and North Korea. While the report stressed that the cyber capabilities of both nations were weaker than those of China and Russia, it nevertheless warned that the nations could develop the ability to conduct disruptive attacks. While the report said that U.S. counterterrorism efforts have reduced the likelihood of a foreign terrorist attack on U.S. soil, it warned that terrorist groups ""can adapt quickly and resurge,"" and said Iran ""will continue to develop and maintain terrorist capabilities"" to deter the U.S. from ""regime-threatening actions"" or to retaliate for such activity. The report made clear that the founding principal of combatting terrorism ""will always be a priority to the Department of Homeland Security."" The report also cited illegal immigration, noting that while the vast majority of migrants do not pose a security risk, ""pathways used by migrants to travel to the United States have been exploited by threat actors."" The report concluded by noting the record-breaking hurricane and wildfire seasons that have caused billions of dollars in damage this year. While the report cited active land management as a potential solution for the wildfires, it did not mention climate change in either section — despite the fact that experts have linked the intensity of the hurricane and wildfire seasons to global warming.",20,4.751508114100041,2.581638603143606,2.1698695109564348,29
2020-09-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/facebook-crackdown-alleged-russian-military-intelligence-operation/,Facebook Shuts Down Alleged Russian Military Intelligence Operation Weeks Before Election,"MENLO PARK (CBS SF / CNN) -- Facebook said Thursday it had identified and shut down a network of fake accounts that included fictitious personas it said were tied to Russian military intelligence. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said that, while the accounts had not been primarily targeting the United States, there is a concern that accounts like this could be used in Russian influence operations as November's US presidential election draws closer. According to US prosecutors, in 2016, Russian military intelligence used fake online personas and set up a website and a Facebook account for ""DC Leaks,"" a page that publicized and distributed hacked emails tied to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Russia was responsible for the hacking, US prosecutors said. Gleicher said Facebook, based in Menlo Park, has not seen specific evidence of a so-called ""hack and leak"" operation but said ""we do think, and I think a number of experts think, realistically this is one of the threats we should be ready for."" Facebook said the accounts it had shut down had been primarily focused on ""the Far East, Russia's neighboring countries, and Syria."" ""They frequently posted about news and current events, including the Syrian civil war, Turkish domestic politics, geopolitical issues in the Asia-Pacific region, NATO, the war in Ukraine, and politics in the Baltics, Georgia, Armenia, Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and the US,"" Facebook said. Twitter also said it shut down related accounts on its platform that it could ""reliably attribute to state-linked entities"" in Russia, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. Facebook said it had evidence that the group had posed as journalists to contact news organizations — something, Gleicher said, American reporters should be mindful of in the final weeks of the election campaign. Facebook also said it shut down accounts tied to people who have been associated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the infamous Russian troll group that used social media to try to meddle in the 2016 election. Facebook identified a website, linked to the pages it shut down, that describes itself as an ""independent analytical center"" but is linked to the troll operation. Facebook identified this after a tip from the FBI, the company said. Earlier this month, following another tip from the FBI, Facebook shut down accounts to a website that was posing as an independent leftwing news outlet. Facebook said that site too was tied to the IRA. The website recruited unwitting American writers to contribute to it.

2020-09-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-takes-down-suspicious-accounts-linked-to-russia/,Facebook takes down suspicious accounts linked to Russia,"Facebook has taken down a slew of suspicious accounts on Facebook and Instagram tied to Russian military or intelligence assets, according to a report the company released Thursday. The FBI tipped Facebook off on some of the posts, which led to the removal of some of the accounts. They targeted several countries, including the U.S., U.K., China and Belarus, although Facebook said the activity primarily focused on Syria and Ukraine. ""We removed three separate networks for violating our policy against foreign or government interference which is coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) on behalf of a foreign or government entity. These networks originated in Russia,"" Facebook announced on its website. One network was tied to the Russian military, another was linked to the Russian Internet Research Agency and the third was associated with Russian intelligence services. On a call with reporters, Nathaniel Gleicher, head of security policy for Facebook, described the three networks as small and not primarily focused on the U.S. However, because of the behavior the networks were engaged in and because between now and Election Day, they might pivot to focus on the U.S., the company decided to remove them. The Russian-linked networks were pretending to be locals in countries they were targeting and attempted to drive people off the platform onto websites that masqueraded as legitimate advocacy or news websites that included leaks of compromising information, Gleicher said. In total, Facebook announced it has removed 214 Facebook users, 35 pages, 18 groups and 34 Instagram accounts for violating its policy against foreign or government interference and coordinated inauthentic behavior on behalf of a foreign or government entity. On Facebook's post, the social media giant said it fears a ""hack and leak"" operation, like the one that occurred during the 2016 presidential election cycle with the emails from the Democratic National Committee. While there is no evidence of an instance like that, Facebook is running a 24-hour operation to combat that possibility. ""We've seen deceptive campaigns target journalists and public figures in the past, including as part of hack-and-leak operations,"" Facebook wrote. ""Hack-and-leak — where a bad actor steals sensitive information, sometimes manipulates it, and then strategically releases it to influence public debate — is one of the threats we're particularly focused on and concerned about ahead of the November elections in the U.S."" Here are a couple of the removed accounts: The country's top counterintelligence official said this summer that multiple foreign adversaries are actively targeting the November election in a variety of ways, from launching influence campaigns in social and traditional media, to targeting election infrastructure, to attempting to compromise the private communications of political officials. ""At this time, we're primarily concerned with China, Russia and Iran, although other nation-states and non-state actors could also do harm to our electoral process,"" Bill Evanina, National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) Director, said in July. ""Our insights and judgments will evolve as the election season progresses."" — CBS News Andres Triay, Olivia Gazis and Kathryn Watson contributed to this post.",20,2.2260470642121537,3.109392935221436,-0.8833458710092823,29

""Recent developments have obligated the Committee to expand the scope of its ongoing investigation,"" Committee Chairman Adam Schiff wrote in a letter to Joseph Maher, the senior official performing the duties of the undersecretary for intelligence and analysis. The committee over the summer began an investigation into the actions of DHS officials in Portland, Oregon, amid ongoing protests. ""The Committee's investigation must now encompass and review a wider range of reported abuses, deficiencies, and problems, including allegations of improper politicization of intelligence and political interference in I&A's mission and activities,"" Schiff continued. He referenced the complaint by Brian Murphy, the former undersecretary of intelligence and analysis. The committee is requesting documents, as well as transcribed interviews with I&A officials. Murphy is expected to be deposed before the Intelligence Committee on September 21. In his complaint, filed September 8, Murphy said that he was instructed by then-Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf to withhold an intelligence notification on Russian activities because it ""made the president look bad."" Murphy objected, the complaint says, telling Wolf ""it was improper to hold a vetted intelligence product for reasons for political embarrassment."" He claims he was later excluded by Wolf from meetings on the subject and that the draft was ultimately edited in a ""misleading"" way in order to ""place the actions of Russia on par with those of Iran and China,"" which, Murphy says, is ""inconsistent with the actual intelligence data."" The draft with the revised analysis was then leaked to the media, according to the complaint, which also details other instances of misconduct and intelligence manipulation by senior Trump administration officials in the White House and DHS. DHS confirmed earlier this month that it withheld publication of a July intelligence bulletin to law enforcement agencies warning that Russia may try to undermine Joe Biden's candidacy by denigrating his mental and physical health, citing ""quality concerns"" about the report's sourcing. A source familiar with the draft DHS report told CBS News that the memo was withheld it because it was poorly written and thinly sourced. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Marco Rubio and Ranking Member Mark Warner also announced Friday that they will investigate some of Murphy's claims. ""These allegations, if true, raise serious concerns about a potential disregard for the objectivity and impartiality of intelligence analysis and the role of I&A in the Department,"" Rubio and Warner said in a letter to Maher.

2020-09-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-interference-russia-china-iran-microsoft-warning/,"Russia, China and Iran ramping up attacks ahead of election, Microsoft warns","Washington — Groups backed by Russia, China and Iran have in recent weeks launched cyberattacks targeting the Trump and Biden campaigns, as well as people and organizations involved in the 2020 race, as part of efforts to interfere in the upcoming election, Microsoft warned Thursday. Tom Burt, the company's corporate vice president of customer security and trust, said in a blog post that the malign activity ""makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election as has been anticipated."" Most of the attacks were detected by the tech company and stopped. The revelation comes after the Treasury Department announced sanctions against four people with links to Russia, including a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Rudy Giuliani in December, for attempting to influence the U.S. presidential election. The lawmaker, Andriy Derkach, has been an ""active Russian agent"" for more than a decade and ""waged a covert influence campaign"" designed to cultivate unsupported narratives concerning officials in the presidential election, the department said. The U.S. intelligence community issued an assessment in August that warned of ongoing activity by China, Russia and Iran. Russia, according to the assessment, is actively trying to ""denigrate"" Biden, while China prefers Mr. Trump loses reelection. Iran, meanwhile, may attempt to ""undermine"" U.S. democratic institutions and the president through online content. Christopher Krebs, head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said they are aware of the hacking attempts detected by Microsoft and noted the efforts did not involve voting infrastructure or impact election systems. ""The announcement is consistent with earlier statements by the Intelligence Community on a range of malicious cyber activities targeting the 2020 campaign and reinforces that this is an all-of-nation effort to defend democracy,"" Krebs said in a statement. ""Everyone involved in the political process should stay alert against these sorts of attacks and today we are releasing guidance for improving cyber defenses against account compromise attacks. We encourage anyone that experiences a cyber incident to report to CISA and the FBI."" Microsoft identified three hacking groups that have targeted hundreds of organizations, consultants, think tanks and political parties involved in the upcoming election. Strontium, operating from Russia and also known as Fancy Bear, has launched a series of attacks observed by Microsoft beginning in September 2019, seeking to steal login credentials or breach accounts, ""presumably to aid in intelligence gathering or disruption operations,"" Burt said. The hacking group's targets include Republican and Democratic consultants, The German Marshall Fund of the United States and other think tanks, national and state party organizations in the U.S., and political parties in the United Kingdom. The Russia-based group was behind the attacks on the Democratic presidential campaign in 2016 and identified in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling in the last presidential election. According to Microsoft, Zirconium, operating from China, has mounted thousands of attacks between March and September, leading to nearly 150 compromises. The hacking group, which is targeting those associated with the presidential campaigns, ""appears to have indirectly and unsuccessfully targeted the Joe Biden for President campaign through non-campaign email accounts belonging to people affiliated with the campaign. The group has also targeted at least one prominent individual formerly associated with the Trump administration."" The China-based hackers are also targeting individuals in the international affairs community, as well as academics from more than 15 universities and accounts with links to 18 international affairs and policy organizations, such as the Atlantic Council and the Stimson Center, Microsoft said. The third hacking group, Iran-based Phosphorus, has ""operated espionage campaigns targeting a wide variety of organizations traditionally tied to geopolitical, economic or human rights interests in the Middle East region."" The group has attempted to hack the personal or work accounts of people involved with the election. Microsoft said between May and June, Phosphorus unsuccessfully tried to log into the accounts of Trump administration officials and staff for Mr. Trump's campaign. Thea McDonald, spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said it takes ""cybersecurity very seriously and do not publicly comment on our efforts."" ""As President Trump's re-election campaign, we are a large target, so it is not surprising to see malicious activity directed at the campaign or our staff,"" she said. ""We work closely with our partners, Microsoft and others, to mitigate these threats."" The Biden campaign confirmed the attacks and said they unsuccessfully targeted ""non-campaign email accounts of individuals affiliated with the campaign."" ""We have known from the beginning of our campaign that we would be subject to such attacks and we are prepared for them,"" the campaign said. ""Biden for President takes cybersecurity seriously, we will remain vigilant against these threats, and will ensure that the campaign's assets are secured."" Microsoft said it would continue to disclose additional activity and called for more federal funding in the U.S. to ensure states can protect their election infrastructure. ""While the political organizations targeted in attacks from these actors are not those that maintain or operate voting systems, this increased activity related to the U.S. electoral process is concerning for the whole ecosystem,"" Burt said.",20,2.8549086423252663,4.19935014734356,-1.344441505018294,29

Brian Murphy, who was principal deputy under secretary in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS before his alleged demotion, says in a whistleblower complaint that he was instructed by then-Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf to withhold an intelligence notification on Russian activities because it ""made the president look bad."" Murphy objected, the complaint says, telling Wolf ""it was improper to hold a vetted intelligence product for reasons for political embarrassment."" He claims he was subsequently excluded by Wolf from meetings on the subject and that the draft was ultimately edited in a ""misleading"" way in order to ""place the actions of Russia on par with those of Iran and China,"" which, Murphy says, is ""inconsistent with the actual intelligence data."" The draft with the revised analysis was then leaked to the media, according to the complaint. Murphy also alleges that Wolf ordered him to shift the focus of future assessments to interference efforts by China and Iran, and that instructions to do so had come from White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien. Murphy declined to comply, he says in the complaint, because ""doing so would put the country in substantial and specific danger."" In August, Murphy was reassigned amid reporting that his office compiled ""intelligence reports"" about journalists and protesters in Portland, Oregon. The complaint also details other instances of misconduct and intelligence manipulation by senior Trump administration officials in the White House and DHS, who Murphy says urged analysts to suppress threat reports related to violent white supremacy and include information on ""left-wing groups."" A DHS spokesperson denied Murphy's claim in a statement to CBS News, writing that the department ""looks forward to the results of any resulting investigation and we expect it will conclude that no retaliatory action was taken against Mr. Murphy."" ""As Acting Secretary Wolf outlined in his State of the Homeland Address today, DHS is working to address all threats to the homeland regardless of ideology,"" the spokesperson said. ""The Acting Secretary is focused on thwarting election interference from any foreign powers and attacks from any extremist group."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's office released the complaint, which Murphy filed on Wednesday. CNN first reported its details. Schiff said his committee would investigate the matter and sent a letter requesting Murphy appear for a deposition on September 21. He also criticized the Trump administration for ending in-person congressional briefings on foreign election interference, in favor of written briefings. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) announced the change late last month. In a statement, Schiff said, ""If written products are being altered for political reasons, or worse withheld entirely, how can the American people trust that this Administration will inform voters on how foreign powers are trying to influence them, or where the threats really come from, and protect our national security— particularly when it contradicts the President's preferred narrative or personal political interests?"" Mark Zaid, Murphy's attorney, said in a statement that Murphy had ""followed proper lawful whistleblower rules in reporting serious allegations of misconduct against DHS leadership, particularly involving political distortion of intelligence analysis and retaliation."" ""We have alerted both the Executive and Legislative Branches of these allegations and we will appropriately cooperate with oversight investigations, especially in a classified setting,"" Zaid said. Last week, DHS withheld publication of a July intelligence bulletin to law enforcement agencies warning that Russia could try to undermine Joe Biden's candidacy by denigrating his mental and physical health, citing ""quality concerns"" about the report's sourcing. A separate DHS bulletin issued last week that was obtained by CBS News said Russia is ""amplifying criticisms"" of voting by mail in order to undermine trust in the electoral process. President Trump has been consistently critical of mail-in ballots, claiming without evidence that foreign actors could seek to compromise mail-in voting. The U.S. intelligence community has said there is ""no information or intelligence"" that any foreign actor is seeking to undermine voting by mail. In a public assessment released last month, ODNI said Russia is actively seeking to ""denigrate"" Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and that actors linked to the Kremlin have tried to boost Mr. Trump's candidacy. It also said China ""prefers that President Trump – whom Beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win reelection,"" and that Iran may try to ""undermine"" U.S. democratic institutions and the president, primarily through online and social media content. Senior Democratic lawmakers who have been briefed on the intelligence underlying the assessment have criticized ODNI for depicting ""three actors of differing intent and capability as equal threats to our democratic elections,"" saying the three countries have demonstrated ""unequal aims, current actions, and capabilities.""

2020-09-09,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/white-supremacy-is-most-lethal-threat-to-the-us-dhs-draft-assessment-says/,"White Supremacy Is 'Most Lethal Threat' To The US, DHS Draft Assessment Says","(CNN) -- White supremacists will remain the most ""persistent and lethal threat"" in the United States through 2021, according to Department of Homeland Security draft documents. The most recent draft report predicts an ""elevated threat environment at least through"" early next year, concluding that some US-based violent extremists have capitalized on increased social and political tensions in 2020. Although foreign terrorist organizations will continue to call for attacks on the US, the report says, they ""probably will remain constrained in their ability to direct such plots over the next year."" The threat assessment -- which also warns of continued disinformation efforts by Russia -- is especially notable as President Donald Trump has often employed race-baiting tactics in his quest for reelection and frequently downplayed the threat from white supremacists during his term in office. The Trump administration has portrayed Antifa and anarchists as a top threat to the US, with the President tweeting this summer that the US will designate Antifa as a terrorist organization. The recently released draft reports, which were made public by Lawfare Editor in Chief Benjamin Wittes and first reported by Politico, assess a host of threats, including cyber, foreign influence and irregular migration. All three drafts state that white supremacist extremists are the deadliest threat. However, the placement and language about white supremacy in three versions of the DHS draft documents differ slightly. The earliest available version of the ""State of the Homeland Threat Assessment 2020"" drafts reads: ""We judge that ideologically-motivated lone offenders and small groups will pose the greatest terrorist threat to the Homeland through 2021, with white supremacist extremists presenting the most lethal threat."" The lead section on terror threats to the homeland is changed in the latter two drafts to replace ""white supremacist extremists"" with ""Domestic Violent Extremists presenting the most persistent and lethal threat."" The reports, however, all contain this language: ""Among DVEs [Domestic Violent Extremists], we judge that white supremacist extremists (WSEs) will remain the most persistent and lethal threat in the Homeland through 2021."" Wittes published the documents because he wanted there to be a ""benchmark about what the career folks at DHS actually assessed the threats to be against"" the final product that is released by the department. He told CNN that ""the most striking thing is in this political atmosphere; they have said what they said"" -- that white supremacist violence is the threat they are most concerned about. ""I don't want to criticize them when that language is there. That said it is somewhat different in the first draft than the subsequent two and I do think the nature of the change is notable as a reflection of the political pressure they are under,"" he said. CNN has reached out to DHS for comment. The final 2020 threat assessment has not been publicly released. The 2020 draft report also finds that Russian state-affiliated actors will continue targeting US industry and all levels of government with ""intrusive cyber espionage."" According to the draft, China and Russia are the most capable nation-state cyber adversaries, but Iran and North Korea also pose a threat to the US. One of the report's ""key take-aways"" is that ""Russia probably will be the primary covert foreign influence actor and purveyor of disinformation and misinformation in the Homeland."" Moscow's primary aim is to undermine the US electoral process and weaken the United States. Some Kremlin-linked disinformation also might motivate acts of violence in the US, the draft report says. Trump has regularly downplayed the threat of white supremacist violence during his presidency, most notably when he said there were some ""fine people"" among the extremists who sparked violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. He's also called Blacks Lives Matter a ""symbol of hate"" and has regularly pushed narratives on Twitter that emphasize violence against White Americans as he seeks to curry support in the suburbs. Officials in his administration, however, have warned against white supremacist extremism. Last year, CNN reported that White House officials rebuffed efforts by their DHS colleagues for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy. Then-acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said last year White supremacist extremism is one of the most ""potent ideologies"" driving acts violence in the US, when he released the department's counterterrorism strategy, outlining the ongoing threats from foreign terrorism and focusing on domestic terror threats, particularly white supremacism. ""In our modern age, the continued menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to the nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population,"" he said in a speech at the Brookings Institution almost a year ago. The threat assessment was prompted by a 2019 DHS counterterrorism strategy that called for annual reports to inform government officials and the public.

For now, kindergarten through 5th grade will remain on the K12 platform, while all middle and high school students went back to Zoom and Microsoft Teams until September 11. That's is when the District will decide what to do next. ""While we have confidence that that platform can be reinitiated without the systemic problems that we identified, or if we abandon it altogether and continue to utilize the district approved, Zoom through Microsoft Teams platform access, we hope that the experience tomorrow will be even better than today's experience,"" said Carvalho.

""We are providing information and guidance to the public so everyone can make their own informed decisions about what they view, read, and share on social media.

Leading the defense of the election is the Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF), which FBI Director Christopher Wray established in 2017 after federal officials discovered that Russian had interfered in the last presidential election, which Donald Trump won. The task force has election crime coordinators in each local field office, including San Francisco. In a statement released to the public Thursday, the FBI stated that ""foreign adversaries, including Russia and China,"" were attempting to illegally influence the election using three methods: The statement came as Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) announced that the intelligence committee confirmed that Russia was trying to interfere in the election. She demanded that the treasury department act and impose sanctions on Russia. The FBI said it's combating these illegal campaigns by informing the public of what they learn from their federal partners and social media companies. The FITF hopes its relationships with social media companies will inspired them to help share threat information, though it admits that these companies ""independently make decisions regarding the content of their platforms and the safety of their members."" ""The FITF considers strategic engagement with U.S. technology companies, including threat indicator sharing, to be critically important in combating foreign influence actors,"" the statement read.

Analysts from the Department's intelligence arm conclude that Russian state media and proxies will likely ""promote allegations of corruption, system failure, and foreign malign interference to sow distrust in democratic institutions and election outcomes."" ""We assess that Russia is likely to continue amplifying criticisms of vote-by-mail and shifting voting processes amidst the COVID-19 pandemic to undermine public trust in the electoral process,"" the bulletin by the agency's Office of Intelligence and Analysis says. ""Decisions made by state election officials on expanding vote-by-mail and adjusting in-person voting to accommodate challenges posed by COVID-19 have become topics of public debate."" The contents of the bulletin were first reported by ABC News. The bulletin says that Russia would likely continue its campaign to undermine public trust in the electoral system, as it did during the 2016 and 2018 elections. It gives the example of Russian state media sowing discord during the Iowa caucuses in February by claiming the election was rigged. ""In the Iowa Caucuses in February, Russian state media and proxy websites claimed that the contest was fixed in favor of establishment candidates and that technical difficulties with the caucusing mobile voting application led to ballot manipulation,"" the bulletin says. ""These outlets continued this narrative into March 2020, claiming that the Democratic Party made a corrupt back-room deal to orchestrate the exit of establishment candidates to consolidate the vote behind former Vice President Biden in advance of the Super Tuesday primary elections."" An unprecedented number of Americans are expected to cast their vote by mail ahead of the November election, due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis has previously raised concerns about Russian interference in 2020. CBS News confirmed that DHS withheld publication of a July intelligence bulletin to law enforcement agencies warning that Russia might try to undermine Joe Biden's candidacy by denigrating his mental and physical health, citing ""quality concerns"" about the report's sourcing. The bulletin raised the possibility that ""Russian malign influence actors"" would promote allegations about candidates' health ""to influence the outcome of the 2020 election."" President Trump has repeatedly attacked voting by mail, promoting baseless claims that mail-in voting would lead to greater cases of voter fraud. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump encouraged supporters in North Carolina to vote twice, once by mail and once in person — which is illegal — in order to ""test"" mail-in voting systems. In June, Mr. Trump claimed on Twitter that ""millions"" of mail-in ballots would be printed by ""foreign countries,"" leading to the ""scandal of our times."" U.S. officials said last week that there is ""no information or intelligence"" of any foreign actor attempting to compromise mail-in voting, contrary to Mr. Trump's claims. Mr. Trump also tweeted on May 26 that ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-in Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent."" The tweet prompted Twitter to issue its first ever fact-check of the president. However, he has also urged supporters in Florida to vote by mail, and has himself requested his own mail-in ballot for Florida's primary election. In a separate assessment, issued last month, the U.S. intelligence community said Russia is actively seeking to ""denigrate"" Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and that actors linked to the Kremlin have tried to boost Mr. Trump's candidacy.",20,3.232552748805656,4.255498324921153,-1.0229455761154975,29

The draft bulletin by DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), which was first reported and published by ABC News, raises concerns that ""Russian malign influence actors"" would promote allegations about candidates' health ""to influence the outcome of the 2020 election."" The report cites posts by Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik about Biden's mental health between September 2019 and May 2020. In March, a Russian proxy website ""refuted media claims that the candidate's gaffes are the result of a stutter, instead arguing these verbal miscues are symptoms of dementia,"" the bulletin said. The unclassified bulletin also notes that RT and Sputnik questioned Hillary Clinton's mental and physical health during the 2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community cited RT's negative coverage of Clinton's health in its January 2017 assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. The DHS document also noted that Iranian and Chinese state media, in contrast, ""have focused on allegations concerning the mental health of the president."" The intelligence community has concluded that Russia, China and Iran are all actively interfering in the 2020 election. Bill Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said in an August statement that Russia is ""using a range of measures to primarily denigrate"" Biden. China prefers that President Trump ""does not win reelection,"" Evanina said, while Iran may try to ""undermine"" democratic institutions and Mr. Trump. News of the DHS bulletin comes days after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said it would cease in-person election security briefings for members of Congress, raising the ire of Democrats who accused the administration of withholding vital intelligence from lawmakers. John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, wrote in a letter to congressional offices that he was ending in-person briefings to prevent ""unauthorized disclosures or misuse"" of intelligence. A source familiar with the draft DHS report told CBS News that the memo was withheld it because it was poorly written and thinly sourced. A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that the bulletin ""lacked the necessary context and evidence for broader dissemination"" outside of the department's intelligence office. ""After briefing the Acting Secretary and he asked questions, I&A career leadership decided to delay the product for further review,"" the spokesperson said. ""These quality concerns in the work process and tradecraft of I&A were also at issue last month when the Acting Secretary took action to remove I&A leadership."" Brian Murphy, the former acting undersecretary for I&A, was reassigned by Acting Secretary Chad Wolf last month after reports revealed his office had gathered intelligence on American journalists. Trump administration officials have insisted that any foreign actors who attempt to interfere in the upcoming election will face retaliation. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told ""Face the Nation"" last month that there would be ""severe consequences."" ""Whether it's China, Russia or Iran, we're not going to put up with it, and there will be severe consequences with any country that attempts to interfere with our free and fair election,"" O'Brien said.

The White House National Security Council (NSC) said in a statement that a Russian vehicle struck a U.S. mine-resistant all-terrain vehicle, ""causing injuries to the vehicle's crew."" A U.S. official told CBS News senior national defense correspondent David Martin that the Russian forces were operating inside a designated ""security zone"" that they had agreed to stay out of. There have been many encounters between Russian and U.S. forces on the ground in Syria and some have been tense, but the official told Martin the incident earlier this week was the first time American troops were injured in such a confrontation. Their injuries were minor, but the official called the Russian forces' actions ""reckless."" Russia's defense ministry released a statement saying it had warned the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition in advance that a column of its military police would pass through. ""In spite of this, in breach of the existing agreements the U.S. troops attempted to block the Russian patrol,"" it said, adding that Russian military police took ""necessary measures"" to end the incident and carry on their mission. The chief of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, gave ""full explanations"" in a Wednesday phone call with General Mark Milley, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Moscow said. The U.S. military declined to comment on the call beyond confirming that it had taken place, saying both sides had ""agreed to keep the specific details of their conversation private."" Videos shared on Twitter, apparently filmed by bystanders and the Russians themselves, appear to show Russian troop carriers and attack helicopters trying to box the U.S. vehicles in and then force them from the area, near Dayrick. Vehicles appear to bump each other, and at one point one of the helicopters hovers very low over the halted Americans, blasting them with propeller wash. National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said the U.S. vehicles were a security patrol of the anti-ISIS coalition. He said the patrol departed the area to de-escalate the situation. ""Unsafe and unprofessional actions like this represent a breach of de-confliction protocols, committed to by the United States and Russia in December 2019,"" said Ullyot. ""The coalition and the United States do not seek escalation with any national military forces, but U.S. forces always retain the inherent right and obligation to defend themselves from hostile acts.""",7,6.4121409541505,6.5596926418718615,-0.14755168772136162,27
2020-08-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mail-in-voting-foreign-interference-no-evidence-us-officials/,U.S. officials say they have no evidence of foreign interference with mail-in voting,"Washington — Top federal officials responsible for securing the nation's election systems said Wednesday that they have no evidence of foreign powers attempting to compromise mail-in voting, undercutting claims by President Trump that voting by mail is susceptible to foreign interference. ""We have no information or intelligence that any nation-state threat actor is engaging in any kind of activity to undermine any part of the mail-in vote or ballots,"" a senior official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a conference call with reporters. For months, the president has railed against states that have expanded mail-in voting ahead of November's elections amid fears about in-person voting during a pandemic. He has insisted, without evidence, that allowing large-scale voting by mail will lead to fraud and open the door to foreign manipulation. ""RIGGED 2020 ELECTION: MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS,"" he tweeted in June. ""IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!"" On Wednesday's call, senior officials from the ODNI, FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) briefed reporters about election security threats and the government's efforts to protect against them. They spoke on the condition that they not be named. A CISA official said targeting of election infrastructure, such as voting machines, is ""in the playbook"" for foreign adversaries like Russia, but no effort to date has ""inhibited the ability for people to vote or the integrity of the process."" ""We saw it in 2016, we know it's an option now. We continue to receive reporting from state and local election officials of scanning and probing of election infrastructure as a whole,"" the official said, adding that the ""vast majority of activity has been blocked, and unsuccessful."" Since 2016, the official said, sensors to detect intrusions into election systems have been installed in all 50 states, and ""90-plus percent"" of votes cast in 2020 are expected to have a record that can be audited. The official declined to make a direct comparison between the level of probing activity that has been detected this year versus 2016, saying the government's improved visibility now makes such a comparison ""tough."" ""We haven't seen, to date, a ramp-up in activity targeting election infrastructure over, say, the last few months,"" the official said. ""Activity level and reporting from states has been relatively consistent."" On August 7, the nation's top election security official said the U.S. intelligence community had determined that Russia is working to ""denigrate"" Democratic nominee Joe Biden, and that some actors linked to the Kremlin are trying to boost the president's reelection bid. In his statement, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director Bill Evanina also noted that China ""prefers that President Trump — whom Beijing sees as unpredictable — does not win reelection,"" and that Iran may attempt to ""undermine"" U.S. institutions and the president. Mr. Trump was quick to dismiss the intelligence community's assessment, claiming that ""the last person that Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump … I don't care what anybody says."" In a separate speech on Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said the government has ""yet to see any activity intended to prevent voting or to change votes,"" but stressed that efforts to interfere by Russia, China and Iran are ongoing. An FBI official on the conference call said Russia remains ""very active when it comes to malign influence"" and ""works hard to get Americans essentially to tear each other apart politically."" The official also said China ""is a significant malign foreign influence player,"" with the goal of gaining ""an economic and technological advantage over the United States and, over time, manage what it hopes to be our decline on the world stage."" ""And we certainly can't neglect the current malign foreign influence threat from several other actors, including Iran,"" the official added. The officials stressed that Americans should be prepared for an ""election time period,"" as opposed to Election Day, noting that mail-in ballots and other coronavirus mitigation measures will almost certainly mean a delay in final election results. ""We also recognize that the 2020 election looks like no other election we've had before,"" a CISA official said. ""American voters will be casting their ballots in the midst of a pandemic and it's going to change a lot about what we are typically used to and what we see in the process."" The official urged voters to be ""prepared, patient and participating"" in November, saying uncertainty ""is a fertile battle ground for our adversaries who seek to divide us and undermine trust in the process.""",20,4.278374995331695,2.941664720142237,1.336710275189458,29
2020-08-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-hackers-2016-election-democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-60-minutes-2020-08-23/,How Russian operatives hacked the DCCC and disrupted the 2016 election - 60 Minutes,"With less than 100 days before the presidential election, U.S. intelligence officials are warning that Russia and other adversaries are once again interfering in our democratic process. In 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his intelligence agencies to create chaos in our system using a combination of social media manipulation, propaganda, and other dirty tricks. President Trump's Justice Department currently has at least two open cases against Russian citizens for disrupting the 2016 presidential and congressional elections. As we first reported last November, 12 Russian military officers are still at large, charged with breaking into the Democratic Party's computers in 2016, stealing compromising information and selectively releasing it to undermine specific candidates. There's no evidence of similar operations against Republicans in 2016. With the 2020 elections just around the corner, a cautionary tale: ""The Russian Hack."" Robert Anderson: The Russians never left. I can guarantee you in 2016 after this all hit the news, they never left. They didn't stop doing what they're doing. Bill Whitaker: This wasn't just a one-time thing? Robert Anderson: No way. Russia doesn't do it that way. Robert Anderson should know. He spent 21 years inside the cloak and dagger world of spies and hackers overseeing the FBI's counterintelligence and cyber Divisions and tracking Moscow's spy agencies, an alphabet of artifice, the FSB, SVR, and, especially, the GRU. Robert Anderson: The GRU is military intelligence. So when we look at the attacks that happened during our presidential races in 2016 you had military organizations inside of Russia attacking our infrastructure. Bill Whitaker: So are they hackers or are they soldiers? Robert Anderson: So they're both. And in most cases, in most of these units, they're not just hackers, they're probably some of the best mathematical minds in Russia. These are seasoned professionals that have worked their way up the ranks to be in these units to carry out these strategic attacks on behalf of that country. These are the hacker-soldiers from GRU unit 26165 who, according to the Justice Department, were responsible for ""breaking and entering"" into the Democratic Party's computers remotely, from Moscow. Their names, ranks and faces are now on the FBI's most wanted list for stealing, among other things, the Democrats' strategic plans, detailed targeting data, and internal polling. GRU Colonel Aleksandr Osadchuk commanded a separate unit, 74455. One of his officers was in charge of spreading the stolen material to political operatives, bloggers and the media. Another hacked state election boards. Bill Whitaker: It wasn't some 400-pound guy in his parent's basement? Robert Anderson: No. This was a well-choreographed military operation with units that not only were set up specifically to hack in to obtain information, but other units that were used for psychological warfare were weaponizing that. This is not an operation that was just put together haphazardly. The Justice Department's National Security Division is overseeing the Russian hacking case. Assistant Attorney General John Demers runs the division, along with deputies Adam Hickey and Sean Newell. DOJ attorney, Heather Alpino, worked with special counsel Mueller on the Russian indictments. All have access to the underlying intelligence, and have no doubt the Russians interfered in the 2016 election. Bill Whitaker: This really happened. John Demers: Yes. That really happened. And we believe that if we had to we could prove that in court tomorrow using only admissible, non-classified evidence to 12 jurors. Bill Whitaker: Do you ever expect to get the 12 Russian officials to trial? John Demers: I would be surprised. But the purpose of the indictment isn't just that, although that's certainly one of the purposes. The purpose of this kind of indictment is even to educate the public. For a legal document, the 29-page indictment is a page-turner. It details how U.S. intelligence agencies tracked each defendant's actions, sometimes by the keystroke, revealing the fictitious names and phony emails used to infiltrate the Democrats' computers, and tracing the stolen data on its circuitous route from Washington, D.C. to Moscow. Bill Whitaker: The information in the indictment is very detailed. You have descriptions of the Russian agents typing into their computers. John Demers: Obviously I can't go into too much detail because I don't wanna reveal investigative methods. But the insight here is that behind every one of those keyboards is not an IP address. It's a human being. Those indicted GRU agents. The U.S. says one team, working out of a building in Moscow called the ""Tower,"" created a website and a provocative character to disseminate the stolen material: Guccifer 2.0. John Demers: So Guccifer 2.0 is a fictional online persona. It's all an effort on the Russian side to hide their involvement. Bill Whitaker: And these guys are pretending to be one lone hacker. John Demers: Correct. Bill Whitaker: And that works? John Demers: What it gives them is plausible deniability, right? They don't need for it to work 100% as long as the Russians can say: ""Wasn't us."" Posing as Guccifer 2.0, the Russians offered up stolen documents to Julian Assange's WikiLeaks and self proclaimed ""dirty trickster"" Roger Stone. It was all part of a broad campaign to disrupt the presidential election. But there was another, less well-known part of the Russian operation: to undermine Democrats running for Congress. Kelly Ward Burton: It started as large document dumps, where Guccifer 2.0 was kind of taunting and saying, ""I have more."" Kelly Ward Burton was executive director of the DCCC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, when the Russians hacked the committee's computers. Kelly Ward Burton: These bullet points at the top are the summary for how we need to win. They swiped and dumped on the internet material she told us cost millions of dollars to produce: battle plans for congressional races; demographic research on voters; and extensive dossiers on the weaknesses of their own candidates. Kelly Ward Burton: So when we deliberate internally about anything, you know, that's not intended to be made public. And that's what makes this so important to understand these as stolen documents. It's not different than Watergate. It's not different than when, you know, Republicans came into the DNC and stole documents from the file cabinets. It's the cyber version of that. They came into our office, and they stole our documents. Documents that were never intended to be public. And then they used that in the election. Ward was shocked when Republicans used the stolen internal materials in a negative ad. Kelly Ward Burton: We reached out to them and asked them. You know, we-- we said, ""We have been the victims of a cyberattack by a foreign adversary. Will you make a commitment not to use any of these stolen materials in the-- in the campaign, or in the 2016 election?"" And they wouldn't make a commitment to do so. She says in the months leading up to the elections, Russian tactics evolved. The indiscriminate document dumps became more frequent and strategic. Kelly Ward Burton: There would be thousands of documents that would show up on one day and then they got smarter, and they started to release specific documents related to our specific races, or documents that were, you know, in our most-targeted states and our most-targeted areas. The Russian agents stole material about candidates running for Congress in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, Illinois, Nebraska, New Mexico and North Carolina. But one swing state seemed to be the Kremlin's primary target: Florida. In 2016, Annette Taddeo was running for Congress in the 26th District, which stretches from South Miami to the Florida Keys, one of the most hotly contested races in this battleground state. Taddeo had the full backing of the DCCC. But her campaign was upended two weeks before the primary. Annette Taddeo: I was on my way to a TV debate, live TV debate, and I get the call about the fact that not only were we hacked, but our information is now public, from our polling to our mail plan. In addition to that, the entire ""Path to Victory."" Bill Whitaker: It's your gameplan? Annette Taddeo: Yes. My opponent, Joe Garcia, showed up at that debate with a printout of all the documents. Her primary opponent, a fellow Democrat, used the hacked material as a prop to paint her as a conniving politician. The same day, Guccifer 2.0 dropped this mocking post: ""the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce."" Taddeo lost the primary. Garcia went on to lose the election to the Republican candidate. Bill Whitaker: You describe South Florida as rough and tumble. But this seems to ratchet it up a notch? Annette Taddeo: We've seen a lot here. But this was, this was a foreign government. This was so much bigger. You know, I've been told by a lotta people, ""You should stop talking about this. It's really not good for you politically to remind people that you lost."" But I refuse to stop talking about it. Because, again, if it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. And it didn't happen to me: It happened to our democracy. Bill Whitaker: You lost by how much? Annette Taddeo: About 700 votes. Marc Caputo: This is a state where elections are decided by a percentage point or so. A coin toss. Add the Russians onto that and you're looking at a real problem. Marc Caputo has covered Florida politics for 20 years. The senior writer for Politico was one of the reporters who received and wrote about the hacked documents. Bill Whitaker: Not a lot of people know that the Russians interfered in five congressional races here in Florida. When did you first get wind of it? Marc Caputo: Well, I'd been paying attention, like the rest of the press corps, that Russia had been hacking and Russia had been trying to interfere in our election system. And then out of the blue I got contacted by this blogger, Hello Florida. The blogger turned out to be this man, Aaron Nevins, one of the shadier political operators in the Sunshine State. The Republican strategist wouldn't talk to us on camera, but he did talk to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigators. He admits direct-messaging Guccifer 2.0, asking for any Florida-related documents. Seeing a willing participant, the Russians flooded Nevins with hacked materials. ""Holy 'F' man,"" he responded. ""I don't think you realize what you gave me… this is probably worth millions of dollars."" Guccifer 2.0 responded: ""OK, you owe me a million"" with a smiley face. Nevins posted the stolen documents on his website, organized in files, and alerted Florida journalists who couldn't resist publishing the Democrats' secrets. At one point Nevins wrote the Russians: ""I honestly think you helped sink Annette Taddeo in Florida 26."" Bill Whitaker: You played a role in disseminating this stolen information. Marc Caputo: I have a role to play as a reporter covering campaigns. And sometimes that information comes to us from a variety of sources. And in this case, it came to us from a source right at the edge of being unusable. But ultimately we decided, ""Well, this tells a legitimate story about how these campaigns view their own candidates."" And voters have a right to that information. Robert Anderson: This operation was a huge success. Former FBI spy-hunter Robert Anderson says Russia's goals today are the same as in the Soviet era: to sow discord in the U.S. and doubt about our democracy around the world. Robert Anderson: The thing that you need to worry about with Russia and every one of their intelligence services is they will learn from these operations. They'll learn how easy it is to gain access to government and private accounts. They'll learn how quickly the information that they put in front of somebody will be disseminated. They will analyze everything they did right or wrong. And when they attack again, they will not come at you the same way. Produced by Graham Messick. Associate producer, Jack Weingart.

2020-08-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-army-green-beret-charged-with-spying-for-russia/,Former Army Green Beret charged with spying for Russia,"A former U.S. Army Green Beret was arrested Friday on espionage charges, accused of handing over classified defense information to the Russian intelligence service in a conspiracy that lasted more than a decade. Prosecutors say that from 1996 to 2011, Peter Rafael Dzibinski Debbins conspired with Russian nationals, who told him they were intelligence agents working for the country's primary military intelligence agency, GRU. During this period, he made repeated trips to Russia, where both his wife and his mother were born. ""Our military is tasked with the awesome responsibility of protecting our nation from its adversaries, and its service members make incredible sacrifices in service of that duty,"" said Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. ""When service members collude to provide classified information to our foreign adversaries, they betray the oaths they swore to their country and their fellow service members."" Court documents indicate that Debbins, 45, was initially contacted by members of the foreign intelligence service while he was a college student studying abroad in Russia in 1996. In meetings with the unidentified intelligence officers, Debbins disclosed he was in his university's ROTC program and planned to join the military after college, but declared he was ultimately a ""son of Russia."" After graduating from college, Debbins returned to Russia in 1997, where he was assigned the code name, ""Ikar Lesnikov,"" by Russian intelligence. He subsequently signed a statement under his code name saying he wished to ""serve Russia."" After beginning U.S. active-duty service in 1998, Debbins was deployed to South Korea to serve as a lieutenant in the 4th Chemical Company. While on leave, he traveled to Russia and provided his contacts in the intelligence service with U.S. defense information, including the number of men in his platoon, their equipment, and mission. ""During these times, Debbins sought to help Russia, as he considered himself pro-Russian and a loyal son of Russia,"" the court documents say. ""Debbins thought that the United States was too dominant in the world and needed to be cut down to size."" Debbins received gifts in exchange for the information he provided to Russian intelligence. In 2000, he was given $1,000 ""as gratitude for his assistance to the Russian Intelligence Service."" Prosecutors say that while Debbins initially dismissed the payment because ""he had true love for Russia,"" he ended up taking it and signing for it with his given code name. Later he received a bottle of cognac and a Russian military uniform. After he left the Army in 2008, Debbins returned to Russia, ""angry and bitter"" about his service in the U.S. Special Forces, and eager to start a business venture in Russia. He ended up working as part of a front created by a GRU officer, and subsequently continued to provide them with information, including classified intelligence about his unit's missions in Georgia and Azerbaijan. He even handed over the names of his team members in the Special Forces, knowing that the Russian officers would try to contact them ""to see if they would cooperate with the Russian intelligence service."" Debbins' cooperation with GRU, also known as ""Fancy Bear,"" is significant, because that arm of Russia's intelligence service would later go on to hack the emails of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election. The Democrats' emails were disseminated via DCLeaks and WikiLeaks and were further amplified by a network of bot accounts on social media. Most recently, GRU has been tied to the hack of Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, was previously a board member. Debbins' arrest is the second high-profile espionage related arrest this week. On Tuesday, Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, a former CIA officer, was accused of selling top-secret information to China in a scheme that also lasted for over a decade. John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security said, ""Two espionage arrests in the past week – Ma in Hawaii and now Debbins in Virginia – demonstrate that we must remain vigilant against espionage from our two most malicious adversaries – Russia and China."" Debbins has been arrested and is being detained at the Alexandria Detention Center. He has been charged with one count of conspiracy to gather or deliver defense information to aid a foreign government, and if convicted, he could be imprisoned for life.",20,4.3354342445914895,5.967415672280508,-1.631981427689018,12

""Whether it's China, Russia or Iran, we're not going to put up with it, and there will be severe consequences with any country that attempts to interfere with our free and fair election,"" O'Brien said in an interview with ""Face the Nation,"" his first since recovering from the coronavirus. ""Whether their leaders prefer Joe Biden or prefer Donald Trump, it doesn't matter. We're Americans. We're not going to have foreign countries deciding who our next president is going to be. That's outrageous."" O'Brien said the Trump administration is taking steps to counter foreign influence in the 2020 election, including by hardening election and cyber infrastructure and working with states, but acknowledged that Russia, China and Iran have engaged in cyberattacks and phishing attempts. Malign actors have also attempted to access secretary of state websites and collect data on Americans, the national security adviser said. ""There's no higher concern that we have than maintaining the free and fair elections that are the cornerstone of our democracy,"" O'Brien said. ""And look, we know that there are people overseas, the Chinese, the Iranians, the Russians, others who would like to interfere with our democracy. And we're going to fight against that."" The warning from the national security adviser to foreign governments less than 100 days before the November election comes after the intelligence community issued its first public assessment Friday on the candidate preferences of some foreign actors. According to the assessment, Russia is working to ""denigrate"" presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and China prefers that President Trump loses his reelection bid. Iran may attempt to undermine U.S. democratic institutions and the president through online and social media content, the intelligence community warned. Russia's influence campaign marks its second attempt to interfere in a U.S. presidential election, prompting questions as to whether Mr. Trump has told Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop meddling and whether he has sanctioned the country hard enough. But O'Brien said that when it comes to Russia specifically, there isn't much left to impose sanctions on. ""We've sanctioned the heck out of the Russians — individuals, companies, the government,"" he said. ""We've kicked out literally scores of Russian spies. We've closed down all their consulates on the West Coast. We closed down diplomatic facilities. There's not a lot left we can do with the Russians."" Still, O'Brien said the message to the Russians, Chinese and Iranians the same: ""Don't get involved in our elections."" ""Don't do it because there will be severe consequences,"" he said.",20,3.3613002111828454,1.4072967962994243,1.954003414883421,29
2020-08-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-intelligence-shows-russia-is-trying-to-denigrate-biden-china-prefers-trump-lose/,"U.S. intelligence shows Russia is trying to ""denigrate"" Biden, while China prefers Trump lose","The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Russia is actively seeking to ""denigrate"" presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and that some actors linked to the Kremlin are trying to boost President Trump's candidacy ahead of the 2020 presidential election, according to the country's top election security official. In an unprecedented statement outlining the candidate preferences of several foreign actors, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director Bill Evanina also said China ""prefers that President Trump – whom Beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win reelection,"" and that Iran may try to ""undermine"" U.S. democratic institutions and the president, primarily through online and social media content. ""Many foreign actors have a preference for who wins the election, which they express through a range of overt and private statements; covert influence efforts are rarer,"" Evanina's statement said. ""We are primarily concerned about the ongoing and potential activity by China, Russia, and Iran."" Mr. Trump dismissed the intelligence on Russia. When a reporter in New Jersey asked the president about the assessment that Russia wants him to win reelection and China wants him to lose, Mr. Trump said, ""The last person that Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump."" When a reporter pointed out that's not what intelligence officials said, the president responded, ""I don't care what anybody says."" His statement, issued less than three months before Election Day, identifies several examples of behavior the intelligence community considered in forming its assessment. Evanina has been the top U.S. counterintelligence official for years and was tapped to lead intelligence-based election security threat briefings in May. ""China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China,"" his statement said. It also cited Beijing's criticism of the Trump administration's COVID-19 response, its closure of the consulate in Houston, and recent actions taken to block social media platform TikTok. Russia, the assessment said, ""is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate"" Biden. ""For example, pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption – including through publicizing leaked phone calls – to undermine former Vice President Biden's candidacy and the Democratic Party."" Mr. Trump's candidacy was being boosted on social media and Russian television by unspecified actors linked to the Kremlin, Evanina's statement said. ""We assess that Iran seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 election,"" the statement continued, adding that Tehran's efforts ""probably will focus on on-line influence."" ""Tehran's motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump's reelection would result in a continuation of U.S. pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change,"" the statement said. Friday's update, which follows mounting pressure from Democratic lawmakers on the intelligence community to release more detailed information about election threats, said it represents ""the most current, accurate, and objective election threat information the IC has to offer in an unclassified setting at this time."" But a U.S. official briefed on the intelligence cautioned that the update, while more detailed, suffered from an underlying lack of clarity about what each country was doing vis a vis the U.S. election, and why. ""Only one of the three is actively seeking to interfere to the benefit of one candidate and at the expense of another, and that's Russia,"" the official said. ""That doesn't mean China doesn't have a preference – but having a preference and doing something about it are not one and the same."" In a bipartisan statement, Senate Intelligence Committee acting Chairman Marco Rubio and Vice Chairman Mark Warner praised Evanina for providing ""additional context"" to a statement he issued late last month, 100 days before the election. ""We thank him for providing this additional information to the American people, and we look forward to his continued engagement, along with other members of the Intelligence Community and the Administration, with the public over the next 87 days,"" the lawmakers said. They encouraged the intelligence community to continue sharing information publicly and admonished political leaders ""on all sides to refrain from weaponizing intelligence matters for political gain."" National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said of Friday's update that the U.S. ""will not tolerate foreign interference in our electoral processes and will respond to malicious foreign threats that target our democratic institutions."" Publicly identifying the candidate preference of a foreign actor ahead of an election is an unprecedented step for the U.S. intelligence community. Although the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Department of Homeland Security issued a joint statement in October of 2016 stating that the Russian government was behind the hacking and dumping of emails and had been scanning and probing election systems, it was not until two months later, in January of 2017, that the intelligence community said explicitly that Moscow, having ""developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump"" took those and other measures in an effort to damage Secretary Clinton's election chances and boost then-candidate Trump's. That assessment – and subsequent efforts by the intelligence community to identify a preferred candidate in closed briefings – have become politically charged topics. Officials who told members of the House Intelligence Committee in February that Moscow had again demonstrated a preference for President Trump were criticized by Republicans who questioned the validity of the underlying intelligence. Press reports about that briefing infuriated Mr. Trump, who tweeted that Democrats had launched a ""misinformation campaign"" about Russia's preference for his candidacy and removed then-acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. Mr. Trump has consistently downplayed Russia's 2016 interference campaign while highlighting Russian president Vladimir Putin's denials that Moscow had meddled at all. The president has also criticized the work of U.S. intelligence agencies, whose findings on Russia's 2016 campaign have been reinforced by a bipartisan Senate Committee and bolstered by the report compiled by special counsel Robert Mueller. Since 2016, intelligence and other administration officials have warned consistently that Russia and other adversaries were likely to continue engaging in election interference, likely using new and more sophisticated and less detectable tactics. All three countries identified in 2020 have previously been named as candidates likely to engage in disinformation and influence campaigns – including in the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment, an annual report compiled by the intelligence community on top global security challenges. ""We expect our adversaries and strategic competitors to refine their capabilities and add new tactics as they learn from each other's experiences, suggesting the threat landscape could look very different in 2020 and future elections,"" the 2019 assessment said. Some Democrats have been sharply critical of many of ODNI's election security disclosures to date. Senior Democrats belonging to the so-called ""Gang of 8,"" a select group of lawmakers routinely briefed by the executive branch on classified matters, criticized Evanina's July statement for creating a false equivalence among actors of ""unequal intent, motivation and capability,"" and that the warning about Russia's activities was ""so generic as to be meaningless."" Those same lawmakers – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Warner – previously expressed concerns that Congress was being targeted in a ""concerted foreign interference campaign"" and called for a defensive counterintelligence briefing from the FBI. On Friday, Pelosi and Schiff welcomed Evanina's update, though they maintained it did not go far enough to differentiate among the activities of the three countries. ""[T]oday's statement still treats three actors of differing intent and capability as equal threats to our democratic elections,"" Schiff and Pelosi said. ""Members of Congress have now been briefed on the specific threats facing the 2020 election, and we have been clear with the Intelligence Community that the American people must be provided with specific information that would allow voters to appraise for themselves the respective threats posed by these foreign actors, and distinguish these actors' different and unequal aims, current actions, and capabilities."" Evanina, along with other senior national security officials, briefed lawmakers in multiple classified sessions late last week and early this week. His statement on Friday explicitly accused the Ukrainian politician, Derkach, of undermining Biden through weaponized leaks. Derkach is known to have met late last year with President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who has spoken openly about working with Ukrainian contacts to obtain information about Biden. Sources previously confirmed to CBS News that Democrats' concerns had stemmed from some of Derkach's materials being sent to certain lawmakers, including members of a Senate committee, led by Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson, that is currently investigating Biden and his son, Hunter. Politico first reported the details of Democrats' concerns. Johnson has denied receiving information from foreign nationals about Biden and, together with Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, accused Democrats of assisting Russian disinformation efforts. In Friday's update, Evanina said the intelligence community would continue to provide classified briefings to relevant stakeholders and unclassified updates to the public. ""Aside from sharing information, let me assure you that the IC is also doing everything in its power to combat both cyber and influence efforts targeting our electoral process,"" he said. ""Our election should be our own."" — CBS News' Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.",20,2.0919416708226564,2.0312146165968086,0.06072705422584779,29

Jankowicz, who wrote the book ""How to Lose the Information War,"" said the U.S. needs a ""joined-up government response"" to disinformation, which she defined as ""false or misleading information used with malign intent."" There were ""not enough"" consequences for Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, Jankowicz said. This has in part allowed Russia, as well as other countries, to continue to engage in disinformation campaigns, she said. ""China's certainly been engaging in similar tactics, although they're a little bit less, I would say, practiced at exploiting our societal fissures"" as Russia, she said. ""Iran has been doing it again in support of Iranian policy. We've also seen Venezuela and North Korea. I mean, it's easy for anyone to do, unfortunately."" Jankowicz was critical of President Donald Trump's messaging toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""You know, we've heard a lot recently about Chinese disinformation and COVID-19. I only wish the Trump administration had been so bullish about Russian disinformation,"" she said. While there are entities in the federal government dealing with disinformation and cybersecurity, there is not a joint effort, Jankowicz said. ""In terms of a joined-up government response, we don't have that because from the highest levels of government, we've not seen President Trump say, 'This is a threat, and I want us to shore up all of our resources to make sure our domestic, democratic processes are not affected,'"" she said. Jankowicz urged Americans to pay attention to disinformation tactics, such as taking advantage of private Facebook groups that are advertised as trusted spaces. ""These audiences are already segmented by vulnerability, essentially,"" she said, adding that Facebook should not allow groups to be private if they reach a certain threshold of membership. ""When you've got hundreds of thousands of members, or even tens of thousands of members in a group, it's no longer a private space, and it's just serving as an ideal vector for bad actors to seed disinformation and to watch it spread,"" she explained. Jankowicz also advises Americans to practice ""informational distancing."" ""When you find yourself getting upset about something you see online, or overly emotional, there's a good chance you're being manipulated. Disinformation runs on that emotion,"" she said. ""And so, when you feel that, just put your device down, close your laptop, walk away for a little bit, and if it's still bothering you, then just do some basic fact-checking work."" Jankowicz's fact-check tips include looking for the information in multiple places, checking if the source is credible by looking for mailing address and phone number, and doing reverse image searches to find the original source of an image.",20,2.161383048835682,2.127283667269274,0.03409938156640813,24
2020-07-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/100-days-before-election-foreign-interference-russia-china-iran/,"100 days before election, top counterintelligence official warns of foreign interference","The country's top counterintelligence official says that multiple foreign adversaries are actively targeting the November election in a variety of ways, from launching influence campaigns in social and traditional media, to targeting election infrastructure, to attempting to compromise the private communications of political officials. ""At this time, we're primarily concerned with China, Russia and Iran, although other nation-states and non-state actors could also do harm to our electoral process,"" Bill Evanina, National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) Director, said in a statement Friday. ""Our insights and judgments will evolve as the election season progresses."" NCSC is part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which coordinates the activities of the country's 17 intelligence agencies. ""Foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections are a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy,"" said Evanina, a career official who has served as NCSC Director since 2014. He was tasked with personally briefing relevant stakeholders – including Congress, political campaigns and candidates – on election security earlier this year. China, his statement said, is ""expanding its influence efforts to shape the policy environment in the United States."" Russia ""continues to spread disinformation in the United States that is designed to undermine confidence in our democratic process and denigrate what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment' in America."" And Iran's efforts ""center around online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media."" The coronavirus pandemic and recent protests for racial justice had provided ""fodder"" for influence and disinformation efforts, Evanina said. His statement drew swift and sharp criticism from top Democratic congressional leaders, who said it created a ""false sense of equivalence"" among China, Russia and Iran – three countries, they cautioned, that have demonstrated ""unequal intent, motivation and capability."" Evanina's warning on Russia's activities in particular, they said, was ""so generic as to be almost meaningless."" The Democrats' response was issued jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner. All four are part of the so-called ""Gang of 8,"" a select group of lawmakers routinely briefed by the executive branch on classified matters. ""A far more concrete and specific statement needs to be made to the American people, consistent with the need to protect sources and methods,"" the lawmakers said. The same group on Monday demanded a defensive counterintelligence briefing from the FBI for all lawmakers before the August recess, expressing concern in a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray that Congress ""appears to be the target of a concerted foreign interference campaign."" Two sources confirmed the Democrats' concerns stem from information derived from Russian intelligence sources and provided to a Senate committee that is currently investigating presumptive Democratic nominee for president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. A spokesman for the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, headed by Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said its staff had already been briefed on the material by the FBI, and that a briefing for members of the committee had also been requested. A Russia-linked effort to disparage a presidential candidate would be reminiscent of efforts by Moscow to influence the 2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community concluded that the Russian government in 2016 launched a broad, multi-prong influence campaign designed to boost then-candidate Trump's chances of winning while damaging Secretary Clinton's. The conclusion has been reinforced by a bipartisan Senate Committee and bolstered by the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller. Neither China nor Iran are known to have attempted to engage in election interference campaigns in 2016. President Trump has consistently downplayed Russia's unprecedented incursion in 2016 while reserving praise for President Vladimir Putin, with whom Mr. Trump spoke on Thursday. Neither government's readout of the leaders' call said election interference was raised. An ODNI official defended Evanina's statement on Friday, stressing that there had been no particular ""order or weight"" ascribed to the adversaries mentioned, but that it was important to explain that ""multiple nations"" are now trying to influence the 2020 election. ""This statement in no way downplays the election-related threats from Russia, which are very serious and which we have briefed to Congressional leaders,"" the official said. ""However, other nation-state actors have entered the election threat arena in a big way and they can't be ignored."" ""This is the beginning of a conversation with the American public,"" the official continued. ""There is more to follow."" Earlier this year, federal agencies issued a framework for notifying Congress, political campaigns and the public of foreign interference. It says explicitly that ""partisan politics shall not play [a] role in the decision to provide notifications."" As part of its multi-part, bipartisan investigation into Russia's 2016 election interference, the Senate Intelligence Committee recommended that the public be informed ""as soon as possible, with a clear and succinct statement"" of any influence campaign targeting elections, even if information is incomplete.",20,1.951243008275542,2.584652310016269,-0.6334093017407267,29
2020-07-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2020-election-interference-pelosi-schumer-fbi-briefing-congress/,Top Democrats request FBI briefing on foreign election interference targeting Congress,"Washington — Democratic congressional leaders on Monday released a joint letter to FBI Director Chris Wray requesting a ""defensive counterintelligence briefing"" on election security for all members of Congress prior to August recess, in a sign concerns about potential foreign interference are mounting as the November election nears. The letter, sent last week by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Mark Warner, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, says the leaders ""believe it is imperative that the FBI provide a classified defensive briefing to all Members of Congress."" ""We are gravely concerned, in particular, that Congress appears to be the target of a concerted foreign interference campaign, which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate, and the presidential election in November,"" the Democrats wrote. The letter was dated July 13 and asked Wray to respond by Monday. The FBI acknowledged receipt of the letter but declined further comment when asked by CBS News. The letter includes a header that says ""unclassified when separated from attachment,"" suggesting the request is based at least in part on classified intelligence. All four lawmakers are part of the Gang of 8, a select group that is briefed by the executive branch on highly classified intelligence matters. ""To ensure a clear and unambiguous record of the counterintelligence threats of concern, the four enclosed with the letter a classified addendum that draws, in large part, from the Executive Branch's own reporting and analysis,"" a congressional official said. The letter did not specify in detail what prompted the all-member briefing request, but its release follows a similar request from Democratic Senators Gary Peters of Michigan and Ron Wyden of Oregon — the ranking members, respectively, of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs (HSGAC) and the Senate Committee on Finance. The two lawmakers wrote to their Republican counterparts last week renewing a request for a briefing from the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force and other intelligence officials regarding certain Ukrainian operatives and the materials they had offered to the committees. Senator Ron Johnson, the HSGAC chairman, has been leading an investigation into Hunter Biden, the son of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden whose work for a natural gas company was at the center of events leading to President Trump's impeachment. ""As Committees charged with safeguarding our homeland security and financial systems, we have a responsibility to fully understand the national security and counterintelligence implications of foreign election interference and your ongoing investigative work,"" Peters and Wyden wrote last week. In a statement Monday, HSGAC spokesman Austin Altenburg said the committee staff had already received a briefing on the issue, and that Johnson had requested an additional briefing for members. ""That briefing has not occurred in part because the agencies requested additional information from minority staff, which has not followed on these requests since mid-May,"" Altenburg said. Peters and Wyden's letter cites recent reporting from the Washington Post documenting interactions between several Ukrainian officials, some of whom have known links to Russian intelligence services, and Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney. Giuliani has spoken openly about his efforts to obtain tapes and documents of conversations that Biden had with Ukrainian politicians while he was vice president. The former New York mayor did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Some materials — including edited recordings of Biden speaking with then-president Petro Poroshenko about the removal of Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin — have already been released publicly by a pro-Russian Ukrainian lawmaker whose father served as a KGB officer. Biden publicly and as a matter of U.S. policy led a group of Western countries calling for the ouster of Shokin, who was widely viewed as tolerant of entrenched corruption in Ukraine. The former vice president does not mention either his son or Burisma in any of the recordings. Some of the Ukrainian officials said in interviews cited by the Post that more materials on Biden would be released later in the summer or closer to the U.S. election. Their timing and target are reminiscent of election interference efforts in 2016 by the Russian government, which the U.S. intelligence community concluded used a combination of influence campaigns on social media platforms and the weaponized release of hacked information to undermine the Clinton campaign while helping then-candidate Trump's election chances. On Friday, Biden said he had been briefed on intelligence showing Russia and China were engaged in activities designed to delegitimize the outcome of the presidential election. ""We know from before, and I guarantee you that I know now, because now I get briefings again. The Russians are still engaged in trying to delegitimize our electoral process. Fact,"" Biden said. He did not specify what kind of briefings he had received or with what regularity he received them. In a statement on Monday, Biden said he is ""putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments on notice"" and warned that any interference would be met with swift retaliation if he wins the White House. ""If elected president, I will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation's government,"" he said. ""I will direct the U.S. Intelligence Community to report publicly and in a timely manner on any efforts by foreign governments that have interfered, or attempted to interfere, with U.S. elections. I will direct my administration to leverage all appropriate instruments of national power and make full use of my executive authority to impose substantial and lasting costs on state perpetrators."" An official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) told CBS News that the office had been consistently providing election security briefings to relevant political stakeholders. ODNI announced in May that the briefings would be led by Bill Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. ""The ODNI has been providing robust intelligence-based briefings on election security to the campaigns, political organizations and Hill leaders,"" the official said. ""In public settings, ODNI has previously warned about nation states seeking to influence or interfere in the upcoming elections."" ""Director Evanina and the ODNI Election Threats Executive continue to support and coordinate closely with FBI, DHS and the interagency as part of the Administration's whole-of-government efforts to secure the 2020 election,"" the official said.

2020-07-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-russian-bounties-briefing-cia-officials-decided-against/,O'Brien says top CIA official decided against briefing Trump on Russia bounty intel,"Washington — National security adviser Robert O'Brien said Wednesday that the senior career CIA officer who briefs President Trump in person made the decision not to verbally brief him on intelligence about a Russian scheme to offer bounties targeting American troops in Afghanistan, saying she lacked confidence in the veracity of the intelligence. ""The president's career CIA briefer decided not to brief him because it was unverified intelligence,"" O'Brien said in an interview with Fox News, adding that she is ""an outstanding officer."" O'Brien told reporters at the White House following his interview that the CIA officer who serves as the president's briefer, who he did not identify, decided not to tell Mr. Trump of the Russian bounty operation ""because she didn't have the confidence in the intelligence that came up."" ""We get raw intelligence and tactical intelligence every day, hundreds of pieces of intelligence come in every day, thousands of pieces of intelligence come in a week,"" he said. ""She made that call and, you know what, I think she made the right call, so I'm not going to criticize her. And knowing the facts that I know now, I stand behind that call."" Later in the day, the president said on Fox Business that the bounties story was a ""hoax"" and ""we never heard about it"" because intelligence officials didn't think it rose to his level. ""The intelligence people, many of them didn't believe it happened at all,"" Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump's consumption of intelligence, both through the President's Daily Brief, a daily written summary, and his in-person intelligence briefings, has come under scrutiny after the New York Times reported Friday that the U.S. had intelligence indicating a Russian military spy unit offered cash payments to Taliban-linked soldiers for killing U.S. troops and coalition forces in Afghanistan. Mr. Trump, O'Brien and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said neither the president nor the vice president were briefed on the Russian operation targeting American soldiers because the intelligence was not verified by the intelligence community. But the Times and the Associated Press reported this week the information was included in Mr. Trump's written intelligence briefings. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Tuesday the president has since been briefed ""on what is unfortunately in the public domain."" ""He has been briefed,"" she said, ""but that does not change the fact that there is no consensus on this intelligence that still has yet to be verified."" O'Brien told reporters the president is now ""fully aware of the situation."" But he noted that once the U.S. received raw intelligence on the Russian bounties, U.S. and coalition forces were made aware even though the intelligence wasn't verified. ""The DOD came out and said as soon as we had this information, we made sure that we had tactics in place, that we took protective measures, to look after our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines in Afghanistan. That hasn't been reported. That was done right,"" he said. ""Here at the White House, when we had this raw intelligence, we started an interagency process to look at options, so that if the intelligence turned out to be verified, if it could be corroborated, then we'd have options to go to the president with to address the Russian situation."" The matter has raised questions among Democrats and Republicans who are urging the White House to provide them with more information on the Russian operation, including what Mr. Trump knew and when. The White House, meanwhile, has chastised the New York Times for its report on the intelligence and criticized the unidentified official who leaked the information to the press. O'Brien told reporters he believes the CIA filed a ""crimes report"" with the Justice Department regarding the leak. The Justice Department on Tuesday declined to comment on whether they are investigating who leaked the Russian bounty finding, after McEnany was pressed as to whether the Trump administration is taking action to identify the government official. ""These are important allegations and if they're verified, I can guarantee you the president would take strong action,"" he said. ""We've been working for several months on options for the president of the United States in the event that this uncorroborated, as the Department of Defense calls it, uncorroborated evidence turned out to be true. It may now be impossible to get to the bottom of this because some government official somewhere decided to leak allegations before we had a chance to get to the bottom of it."" White House officials met with a group of House Republicans and a group of House Democrats separately this week to discuss the Russian bounty intelligence, though Democrats who attended their meeting Tuesday said they did not hear from key officials within the intelligence community or learn anything new. The White House is expected to hold a briefing with the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" — leaders of the House and Senate, and leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees — on Capitol Hill on Thursday, senior administration officials told CBS News.

""The purpose of the briefing process is to meet the particular needs of the president and present it to him in the way that best suits his desires. The problem with Donald Trump is not that he is not receptive to one means or another. He's just not receptive to new facts,"" Bolton told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview for this week's episode of ""The Takeout"" podcast. The episode will be available for download Friday morning and air in its entirety on CBSN on Friday and Saturday at 9 p.m. ET. Bolton said the president's intelligence briefings do not contain as much information as they should, which he attributed to the president's preferences for consuming intelligence. ""It's not that the intelligence community is failing, it's that the president doesn't value this information as highly as his predecessors have, and as highly as he should,"" Bolton continued. His new memoir documenting his time in the White House, ""The Room Where It Happened,"" is published by Simon & Schuster, a division of ViacomCBS. The longtime conservative foreign policy hand declined to comment on reports that he had been involved in briefing the president on the intelligence in 2019, but said he believed he could discuss news reports about the intelligence following comments by current national security adviser Robert O'Brien in an interview Wednesday morning. O'Brien said a senior career CIA officer who briefs Mr. Trump in person made the decision not to present him with the allegations because the officer lacked confidence in the credibility of the intelligence. Bolton said the veracity of intelligence falls along a spectrum, but he believed the allegations were important enough to warrant briefing the president personally. ""It's a complex process and there's no point where it gets to be, you know, just right like in Goldilocks and three bears, and then you run in and tell the president,"" he said. ""You don't take everything in to the president, but when American troops are threatened by an adversary like Russia in this way, if there's any indication this is an ongoing operation, it's something the president needs to take into account."" Bolton said he agreed with Susan Rice, the former national security adviser in the Obama administration, who wrote an op-ed on Tuesday criticizing the Trump administration's handling of the intelligence. ""She said she would have walked in and shown it to Obama,"" Bolton said. ""I would have done the same if — I hope I would have done the same if I had this kind of information."" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has repeatedly denied that the president was briefed on the allegations. ""There was not a consensus among the intelligence community,"" McEnany told reporters at Monday's White House press briefing. ""In fact, there were dissenting opinions within the intelligence community, and it would not be elevated to the president until it was verified."" Bolton said the changing explanations from the White House about Mr. Trump's knowledge of the allegations raise doubts about the president's engagement on serious issues. ""The demonstration of the confusion inside the White House only gives our adversaries the stronger impression that the president simply doesn't pay attention to what he's being told, or to thinking systematically about how you respond to it,"" Bolton told Garrett.",20,1.2800947019550486,1.0099619188920803,0.2701327830629683,14
2020-06-30,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-democrats-white-house-briefing-russian-bounty-intel-us-troops/,House Democrats frustrated by White House briefing on Russia bounty allegations,"Washington — A group of House Democrats who attended a White House briefing Tuesday morning about intelligence that a Russian spy unit offered bounties to Afghan militants for killing U.S. and coalition forces expressed frustration about the substance of the meeting, saying it did not include key stakeholders from the intelligence community who could address the allegations or provide any new information. ""We did not receive any new substantive information,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, told reporters at the Capitol following the meeting at the White House. Congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, lamented that ""the right people were not in the room to give us the kind of briefing that we needed to get."" ""We need to hear from the heads of the intelligence agencies, about how they assess the allegations that have been made publicly,"" Schiff, a Democrat from California, said. ""What can they tell us about the truth or falsity of these allegations? What can they tell us about steps they are undertaking or have undertaken to vet any information that they might have? So it might be the right people were not in the room to give us the kind of briefing that we needed to get."" A group of 11 House Democrats who either chair the relevant committees or have national security backgrounds attended the briefing on Tuesday morning to discuss the alleged Russian operation to offer cash payments to Taliban-linked militants to attack U.S. troops, which was first reported by the New York Times on Friday. The Times reported that President Trump was briefed on the intelligence and officials had drawn up a list of options for how to respond. But Mr. Trump and top administration officials, including Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, denied the president was briefed on the allegations, citing concerns surrounding the validity of the intelligence. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said in a statement Monday ""because the allegations in recent press articles have not been verified or substantiated by the Intelligence Community, President Trump had not been briefed on the items."" But the New York Times reported later Monday that the allegations were included in the president's written daily intelligence briefing in late February. The Associated Press, meanwhile, reported that top White House officials knew of the intelligence about the Russian operation in early 2019, and the assessment was included in at least one of the president's written daily intelligence briefings. Reports of the intelligence raised concerns from Republicans and Democrats alike who are pressing the White House for answers on the alleged Russian bounties, as well as what Mr. Trump knew and when. A group of House Republicans received a briefing at the White House on Monday afternoon, before House Democrats met with officials there Tuesday morning. The president has equated the New York Times report that he was briefed on the alleged Russian bounties to ""another fabricated Russia Hoax,"" though Hoyer fired back at the characterization. ""Nothing in the briefing we have just received led me to believe this is a hoax,"" he said. Hoyer said the finding of the alleged Russian bounties ""was a red flag,"" adding ""it was either not waved, or the president ignored the wave."" A person who was in the room told CBS News that the briefing for House Democrats included White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, O'Brien and Ratcliffe, along with other top White House officials. One of the ""major challenges"" of the meeting, this person said, was ""there was far too much time and focus on The New York Times and what they reported and why they reported it, and certainly not enough time addressing our actual questions related to a timeline of the information discussed in the report or in the article."" Ratcliffe, O'Brien and CIA Director Gina Haspel have all separately denounced the leaking of classified information to reporters, warning in separate statements it endangers national security and puts U.S. forces at risk.

2020-06-30,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/us-investigating-whether-delaware-marine-christopher-slutmans-death-was-part-of-alleged-russian-bounty-us-troops/,US Investigating Whether Delaware Marine Christopher Slutman's Death Was Part Of Alleged Russian Bounty On US Troops,"PHILADELPHIA (CBS/AP) -- The U.S. is investigating whether a Delaware Marine died because of reported Russian bounties on U.S. troops. Sgt. Christopher Slutman, of Wilmington, and two other Marines were killed in an attack on their convoy in Afghanistan last year. Intelligence that Russia was offering the Taliban money to kill U.S. troops was allegedly included in President Donald Trump's daily written report but the White House continues to deny Trump was personally briefed. President Trump on Tuesday came under growing pressure to respond to allegations that Russia offered bounties for killing American troops in Afghanistan, with Democrats demanding answers and accusing Trump of bowing to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the risk of U.S. soldiers' lives. Frustrated House Democrats returning from a briefing at the White House said they learned nothing new about American intelligence assessments that suggested Russia was making overtures to militants as the U.S. and the Taliban held talks to end the conflict in Afghanistan. Senate Republicans who attended a separate briefing largely defended the president, arguing along with the White House that the intelligence was unverified. The intelligence assessments were first reported by The New York Times, then confirmed to The Associated Press by American intelligence officials and others with knowledge of the matter. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that Trump had been briefed on the intelligence, a day after saying he hadn't because it had not been verified. McEnany added that there were still reservations within the intelligence community on the veracity of the allegations. ""Make no mistake. This president will always protect American troops,"" she said. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and a small group of other House Democrats met with White House officials as Trump downplayed the allegations. The Democrats questioned why Trump wouldn't have been briefed sooner and pushed White House officials to have the president make a strong statement about the matter. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, one of the Democrats who attended the briefing, said it was ""inexplicable"" why Trump won't say publicly that he is working to get to the bottom of the issue and why he won't call out Putin. He said Trump's defense that he hadn't been briefed was inexcusable. ""Many of us do not understand his affinity for that autocratic ruler who means our nation ill,"" Schiff said. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., a freshman and former Navy helicopter pilot and Russia policy officer, said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows briefed the group. She said the Democrats told the White House briefers that the president should make a statement. ""These are very concerning allegations and if they're true, Russia is going to face repercussions,"" Sherrill said. ""We really pushed that strongly in the meeting."" She wouldn't say how the White House officials reacted or say if the briefers told the Democrats that in fact Trump had been briefed. Trump and his aides set a high bar for briefing a president since it is rare for intelligence to be confirmed without a shadow of doubt before it is presented to senior government decision-makers. McEnany declined to say why a different standard of confidence in the intelligence might apply to briefing lawmakers than for bringing information to the president. Some House Republicans who were briefed by the White House on Monday also said they left with questions. Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said the panel would ""leave no stone unturned"" in seeking further information. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming insisted there would be ""ramifications"" for any targeting of Americans. But Senate Republicans seemed less concerned and questioned the media reports. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he didn't think Trump should be ""subjected to every rumor."" ""Conclusions, apparently, were not reached,"" McConnell said. The White House was working to schedule a briefing for Wednesday with McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the top Republicans and Democrats on the two intelligence committees according to a person familiar with the talks. The person declined to be identified because the so-called ""Gang of 8"" briefing will be classified. That group receives the most sensitive information in regular meetings with administration officials. A separate group of Senate Republicans briefed in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday appeared mostly satisfied with the answers they received. Senate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said he was ""convinced"" Trump hadn't known about the intelligence. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Trump ""can't be made aware of every piece of unverified intelligence."" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Marco Rubio said he believed the U.S. was prepared ""to do everything possible to protect our men or women stationed abroad, from a variety of threats."" Some Republican senators did express frustration. Nebraska Republican Ben Sasse, a member of the intelligence panel, said Monday evening that Congress should focus on finding out who knew what, and when, ""and did the commander in chief know? And if not, how the hell not?"" While Russian meddling in Afghanistan isn't new, officials said Russian operatives became more aggressive in their desire to contract with the Taliban and members of the Haqqani Network, a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan and designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2012. The intelligence community has been investigating an April 2019 attack on an American convoy that killed three U.S. Marines after a car rigged with explosives detonated near their armored vehicles as they traveled back to Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan, officials told the AP. Three other U.S. service members were wounded in the attack, along with an Afghan contractor. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. The officials the AP spoke to also said they were looking closely at insider attacks — sometimes called ""green-on-blue"" attacks — from 2019 to determine if they are also linked to Russian bounties. One official said the administration discussed several potential responses, but the White House has yet to authorize any. Intelligence officials told the AP that the White House first became aware of alleged Russian bounties in early 2019 — a year earlier than had been previously reported. The assessments were included in one of Trump's written daily briefings at the time, and then-National Security Adviser John Bolton told colleagues he had briefed Trump on the matter. Bolton declined to comment on that matter, and the White House did not respond to questions. The intelligence officials and others with knowledge of the matter insisted on anonymity to discuss the highly sensitive matter. Trump's Democratic general election rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, accused the president Monday of a ""betrayal"" of American troops in favor of ""an embarrassing campaign of deferring and debasing himself before Putin."" ""I'm disgusted,"" Biden told donors, as he recalled his late son Beau's military service. Families of service members, Biden said, ""should never, ever have to worry they'll face a threat like this: the commander in chief turning a blind eye."" Asked about the reports on the alleged bounties, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, ""These claims are lies."" (© Copyright 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

2020-06-29,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/pelosi-bipartisan-congress-trump-russia-bounty-answers/,Pelosi Leads Bipartisan Congress Members Demanding Answers From Trump On Russia Taliban Bounties,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A bipartisan group of congressional leaders is demanding the Trump administration explain what it knew about reports U.S. intelligence concluded Russia offered bounties to Taliban fighters to kill U.S. troops. The White House briefed a group of House Republican lawmakers on the matter on Monday, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and CIA Director Gina Haspel to provide all-member briefings to Congress on the intelligence. And several key Senate Republicans said they are seeking more information from the Trump administration, too. ""Congress and the country need answers now,"" wrote Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco. ""Congress needs to know what the intelligence community knows about this significant threat to American troops and our allies and what options are available to hold Russia accountable. The Administration's disturbing silence and inaction endanger the lives of our troops and our coalition partners."" The swift response underscored the congressional push for information about the US intelligence -- and swirling questions over whether President Donald Trump was briefed about it, which Trump has denied. Pelosi -- a member of the ""Gang of Eight,"" the congressional leaders who are briefed on sensitive intelligence matters -- said Sunday she was not told about the bounties offered to the Taliban. The House and Senate Intelligence Committees declined to comment. ""It seems clear that the intelligence is real. The question is whether the president was briefed,"" Pelosi told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday. ""If he was not briefed, why would he not be briefed? Were they afraid to approach him on the subject of Russia?"" This weekend, the New York Times, CNN and other news outlets reported Russian intelligence officers offered money to Taliban militants in Afghanistan as rewards if they killed U.S. or UK troops there. While it's unclear whether Trump was aware, there have been recent discussions at high levels between the US and the UK to share the intelligence, two sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Monday there was ""no consensus within the intelligence community"" about whether Russia offered to pay bounties to the Taliban for killing American troops in Afghanistan. McEnany said there was ""dissent"" within the intelligence community about the intelligence. ""Intelligence is verified before it reaches the President,"" she said during a briefing at the White House. Pressed whether the information was included in the presidential daily briefing -- the written document that includes the intelligence community's more important and urgent information -- McEnany said only Trump ""was not personally briefed."" On Sunday, Trump described the reporting as ""possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax."" ""Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @VP,"" Trump tweeted Sunday evening. ""Possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax, maybe by the Fake News @nytimesbooks, wanting to make Republicans look bad!!!"" House Republicans briefed on Monday Some GOP lawmakers received a briefing Monday on the intelligence from Ratcliffe, national security adviser Robert O'Brien and chief of staff Mark Meadows, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The lawmakers included Republican Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Mac Thornberry of Texas, Mike McCaul of Texas, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Jim Banks of Indiana, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Elise Stefanik of New York and Chris Stewart of Utah. After the briefing, McCaul and Kinzinger said in a statement that a review is ongoing to assess the accuracy of the media reports. ""If the intelligence review process verifies the reports, we strongly encourage the Administration to take swift and serious action to hold the Putin regime accountable,"" they said. Kinzinger told reporters that he believed it was accurate that the intelligence ""shouldn't have risen"" to Trump's level because there was conflicting intelligence. ""But the administration went forward with additional force protection maneuvers to protect our troops in case they found out and advised other troops in the region,"" Kinzinger said. Banks accused the New York Times of using ""unconfirmed intel in an ONGOING investigation into targeted killing of American soldiers in order to smear the President."" ""Now it's impossible to finish the investigation,"" he said. Thornberry told reporters Monday morning before the briefing he was concerned if the president was not briefed on intelligence that U.S. troops could have been endangered. ""What the president and the DNI have said is that the president was not briefed, which to me is a very concerning statement,"" Thornberry said. ""I don't know the credibility of the information because I have not been briefed, but anything with any hint of credibility that would endanger our service members, much less put a bounty on their lives, to me should have been briefed immediately to the commander-in-chief and a plan to deal with that situation."" House Democrats to be briefed Tuesday House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer is bringing a group of House Democrats to the White House to be briefed Tuesday morning, according to an aide, who added that was ""not a substitute for an all-House briefing."" House Intelligence chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said he expected to attend that White House briefing and he has also requested a classified briefing for his committee from the intelligence community. Schiff told CNN's Jim Acosta the White House explanation that Trump wasn't briefed because of conflicting intelligence wasn't sufficient. ""It is frequently the case that the president should be briefed on matters where there is no absolute certainly about the intelligence on a given topic,"" Schiff said. ""It's not sufficient to say we didn't tell him because we couldn't dot every I, cross every T, prove every point. ... If it goes to the protection of our troops, that's something that needs to be briefed to the commander in chief."" House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith also requested a briefing for his committee on Monday, along with Thornberry. Smith told reporters Monday that the committee was seeking information from the Pentagon and intelligence community ""to get real answers as to what we knew, when we knew it, and how we reacted."" ""It's a very important story,"" the Washington Democrat added. In the Senate, Republican committee leaders also sought additional information. ""We've known for a long time that Putin is a thug and a murderer and, if the allegations reported in the New York Times are true, I will work with President Trump on a strong response. My number-one priority is the safety of our troops,"" Senate Armed Services chairman Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, tweeted Monday. ""Right now, though, we need answers. I have asked the administration to share what it knows and I expect to know more in the coming days."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of Trump, said he expected the Trump administration ""to take such allegations seriously and inform Congress immediately as to the reliability of these news reports."" Acting Intelligence chairman Marco Rubio on Monday declined to comment ""on specific recent reports."" ""However, the targeting of our troops by foreign adversaries via proxies is a well established threat,"" Rubio tweeted.

2020-06-29,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-russia-bounty-briefing-answers/,White House says Trump wasn't briefed on Russia bounty intel as lawmakers demand answers,"Washington — White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany repeatedly denied that President Trump was briefed on reported intelligence that Russian military intelligence offered cash payments to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. troops and coalition forces in Afghanistan. ""There was not a consensus among the intelligence community,"" McEnany told reporters at Monday's White House press briefing. ""In fact, there were dissenting opinions within the intelligence community, and it would not be elevated to the president until it was verified."" McEnany was pressed on why Mr. Trump did not receive a briefing on the intelligence about the Russian operation, reported over the weekend by the New York Times and the Washington Post, and repeatedly told reporters the intelligence in question has not been verified. ""This was not briefed up to the president because it was not, in fact, verified,"" she said. National security council spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement Sunday, ""The veracity of the underlying allegations continues to be evaluated."" In an explosive report published Friday, the New York Times said U.S. intelligence officials concluded a Russian military spy unit offered bounties to the Taliban-linked militants for the killing of coalition forces in Afghanistan. According to the Times report, Mr. Trump was briefed on the finding, and White House officials developed options for addressing the matter. The Washington Post subsequently reported the Russian operation Saturday, citing U.S. officials who said Trump administration leaders learned of the cash payments in recent months from U.S. intelligence agencies. The president, however, has denied that he was briefed on the intelligence finding, tweeting Sunday night that ""Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me"" or Vice President Mike Pence. McEnany separately said in a statement Friday the ""CIA director, national security adviser and the chief of staff can all confirm that neither the president nor the vice president were briefed on the alleged Russian bounty intelligence."" She added that her statement ""does not speak to the merits of the alleged intelligence"" and asserted that the New York Times had ""erroneously"" suggested the president was briefed. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Saturday he ""confirmed that neither the President nor the Vice President were ever briefed on any intelligence alleged by the New York Times in its reporting yesterday."" But the reports from The New York Times and Washington Post have generated concerns from Republicans and Democrats alike who are pressing the Trump administration for answers on the reported intelligence on Russia's operation and whether Mr. Trump was informed of the matter. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter Monday to Ratcliffe and CIA Director Gina Haspel requesting an interagency brief for all House members. ""The questions that arise are: was the President briefed, and if not, why not, and why was Congress not briefed. Congress and the country need answers now,"" Pelosi, a Democrat from California, wrote. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and one of Mr. Trump's closest allies on Capitol Hill, said Saturday it was ""imperative Congress get to the bottom"" of the reports. ""I expect the Trump administration to take such allegations seriously and inform Congress immediately as to the reliability of these news reports,"" he tweeted. Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-highest-ranking Republican in the House, said the White House must explain why neither Mr. Trump nor Pence were briefed on the intelligence and whether it was in the President's Daily Brief, and she said the White House should disclose who knew of the intelligence and when, and what the Trump administration would do in response to the reported operation by Russia. McEnany told reporters Monday that she would not ""get ahead"" of Mr. Trump regarding further actions toward Russia and President Vladimir Putin. A group of lawmakers met at the White House on Monday for a briefing on the reported intelligence, McEnany said. She did not detail who was in attendance, but said a ""bipartisan invitation"" had been extended. Members of the House Armed Services and Intelligence committees were invited to the White House for a briefing on the Russia allegations; Republicans went to the White House Monday, and a senior administration official later confirmed that congressional Democrats from the same committees would be briefed at the White House early Tuesday morning.

2020-05-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-security-agency-cyberattack-sandworm-russia-hackers/,NSA warns of new cyberattacks by Russian military hackers,"A notorious hacking team backed by the Russian government has been exploiting a serious flaw in commonly used email software, the National Security Agency (NSA) warned Thursday, issuing a rare advisory that publicly attributed attempts to utilize the software flaw to a nation-state actor. The NSA's Cybersecurity Directorate said a group of cyber actors known as ""Sandworm team"" from the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, had identified and exploited a vulnerability in the popular email software Exim Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) since at least August 2019. ""The Russian actors … have used this exploit to add privileged users, disable network security settings, execute additional scripts for further network exploitation; pretty much any attacker's dream access – as long as that network is using an unpatched version of Exim MTA,"" the advisory said. The agency advised users to immediately update the software and warned that any outdated versions would likely remain vulnerable to attack. ""When the patch was released last year, Exim urged its users to update to the latest version. NSA adds its encouragement to immediately patch to mitigate against this still current threat,"" it said. Sandworm is known to have operated for at least a decade and has been linked to large-scale cyberattacks on government, energy and telecommunications sectors in Ukraine and Poland, as well as on NATO and the European Union. The group was determined to be behind the devastating 2017 NotPetya attacks, which caused billions of dollars of damage across Europe, the United States and Asia. In February, the State Department publicly blamed Sandworm for a widespread cyberattack on government and private websites in the country of Georgia. ""This is a dangerous vulnerability that can provide an entryway for one of the most threatening cyber actors into the inner sanctum of corporate and government networks,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and former chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator. ""It is an important sign that NSA is now providing this highly relevant context about which adversary is exploiting this vulnerability that is highly helpful for defenders to prioritize defense and other mitigation efforts,"" Alperovitch said. Michael Daniel, president of the Cyber Threat Alliance and cybersecurity coordinator in the Obama administration, said other cyber actors were also likely to follow the Russians' lead. ""If an adversary can carry out these actions on your network, they can do whatever they want and you have very limited ability to detect or stop them,"" Daniel said. ""If the Russians are exploiting this vulnerability, then other actors are either using it, too – or they soon will,"" he said, noting the recommended patch was a simple and effective fix. The NSA's Cybersecurity Directorate, which was restructured and newly launched last October, has been charged with disseminating more unclassified threat information more quickly, so that private sector entities can take steps to protect themselves from cyber attacks. In January, the directorate announced a critical flaw in Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system. It notably disclosed the vulnerability to the company instead of using it to carry out cyber activities of its own, as had been its practice in the past. The NSA on Wednesday launched a new Twitter account, @NSACyber, where news of the Exim vulnerability was also announced.",20,7.515699882642506,5.66046824707371,1.8552316355687966,16
2020-04-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-intelligence-committee-report-2016-russian-interference-assessment/,Bipartisan Senate Intel report backs intelligence assessment of 2016 Russian interference,"The Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday reaffirmed the accuracy and integrity of a 2017 joint assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies, who determined that Russia's coordinated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election was meant to benefit President Trump. The committee's review is the fourth and penultimate chapter resulting from the committee's investigation into the Russian government's actions, a probe that has spanned more than three years. In its heavily redacted 158-page report, the committee found that the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) commissioned by former President Barack Obama in late 2016 ""presents a coherent and well-constructed intelligence basis for the case of unprecedented Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election."" The report was unanimously approved by senators on the committee. ""The ICA reflects strong tradecraft, sound analytical reasoning, and proper justification of disagreement in the one analytical line where it occurred,"" Republican Senator Richard Burr, the committee chairman, said in a statement accompanying the report's release. ""The Committee found no reason to dispute the Intelligence Community's conclusions."" A declassified version of the ICA — which was compiled by the CIA, FBI, National Security Agency (NSA) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and is otherwise highly classified — was released publicly on January 6, 2017. The committee review said interviews with those involved in drafting the ICA showed that ""analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions."" ""All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process,"" the report said. The panel's investigators conducted 25 interviews and hearings with more than 40 intelligence officials involved in creating the ICA. The committee's bipartisan finding is notable given an ongoing Justice Department review of the government's investigation into Russia's election interference led by U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut John Durham. Durham has focused at least part of his probe on the crafting of the ICA, which has stoked concerns among intelligence officials who say a federal prosecutor's scrutiny could have a ""chilling effect"" on the community's analytic processes. Among the ICA's findings that proved to be more controversial over time was the accompanying assessment that the Russian government's efforts were designed to boost then-candidate Donald Trump's chances of winning the election while damaging Hillary Clinton's. That judgment was delivered with high confidence by the CIA and FBI; the NSA had moderate confidence. Republican allies of the president later maintained that Russia did not intervene on behalf of any one candidate, only that it intended to sow chaos in U.S. political processes. Since before he was elected, Mr. Trump himself has frequently questioned the scope and aim of Russia's interference and decried some U.S. intelligence findings as a ""hoax."" The ICA's principal finding, delivered with ""high confidence,"" was that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an influence campaign aimed at the 2016 election and designed to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral process. The Senate Intelligence Committee previously released a brief, unclassified summary of its findings on the ICA, declaring it in July 2018 to be a ""sound intelligence product"" with findings that were later bolstered by continued intelligence collection. The committee faulted the assessment for providing inadequate ""historical context"" about Russia's previous attempts at election interference. But where agencies had different confidence levels in a finding, the committee found ""analytical disagreement was reasonable, transparent, and openly debated"" by the relevant analysts and agency heads. Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, in their own report on the matter, faulted the ICA for its judgment that Russia preferred Mr. Trump, saying agencies failed to employ ""proper analytic tradecraft."" Tuesday's more comprehensive report said the committee ""did not discover any significant analytic tradecraft issues in the preparation or final presentation of the ICA."" It said the difference in confidence levels was the responsibility of then-CIA Director John Brennan and then-NSA director Admiral Michael Rogers, both of whom ""independently expressed to the Committee that they reached the final wording openly and with sufficient exchanges of views."" ""The ICA correctly found the Russians interfered in our 2016 election to hurt Secretary Clinton and help the candidacy of Donald Trump,"" Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel's vice chairman, said Tuesday. ""Our review of the highly classified ICA and underlying intelligence found that this and other conclusions were well-supported."" In one of the few sections of the report that was not completely redacted, the committee also evaluated the internal debate over the potential inclusion of materials from the dossier produced by former British intelligence official Christopher Steele. ""All individuals the Committee interviewed stated that the Steele material did not in any way inform the analysis in the ICA — including the key judgments — because it was unverified information and had not been disseminated as serialized intelligence reporting,"" the report said. At the apparent insistence of FBI officials, the material was ""instead included in Annex A of the compartmented ICA."" ""FBI officials told the Committee that they 'would have had a major problem if Annex A had not been included,'"" the panel wrote. The committee said the ICA would have benefitted from including more context about previous Russian election interference efforts and noted that the group assembling it, despite being tasked by President Obama with producing a set of policy recommendations about how to prevent future foreign incursions, did not include them. ""The absence of policy recommendations was deliberate, due to the well-established norm that the IC provides insight and warning to policy makers, but does not itself make policy,"" the report said. It also reiterated that subsequent intelligence collection had strengthened the ICA's initial findings. ""Since January 2017, the Committee has discovered additional examples of Russia's attempt to sow discord, undermine democratic institutions, and interfere in U.S. elections,"" the report said. The U.S. intelligence community has continuously warned that Moscow would again attempt to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, likely using more sophisticated tactics. The question of whether Russia would show support for a particular candidate has already proven politically divisive. In February, Mr. Trump abruptly dismissed acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire after ODNI official Shelby Pierson told the House Intelligence Committee in a classified briefing that Russia had developed a ""preference"" for Mr. Trump in the 2020 election. In a subsequent briefing to all members of Congress, administration officials said they had ""nothing to support"" the notion that Putin favored one candidate over another. Pierson was excluded from the latter briefing. The Senate Intelligence Committee released three previous volumes of its final product. The first focused on election security and was made public in July 2019. It was followed by a second, released in October 2019, on the coordinated campaign Russia waged on social media.

2020-03-30,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak-china-russian-style-disinformation-tactics/,"Amid COVID-19 outbreak, China shifts to use ""Russian-style"" disinformation tactics","China has in recent months significantly expanded its official presence on Western social media platforms and, in an apparent effort to influence public opinion about the spread of COVID-19, moved toward a ""Russian style"" of spreading disinformation, an independent assessment has found. Official Chinese accounts adopted a ""more confrontational posture"" in their messaging on the virus beginning in late February and throughout March, as COVID-19 cases were confirmed across Europe and within the U.S., according to preliminary findings from a disinformation-tracking tool. Some of the most engaged content included criticism of the Trump administration's handling of the outbreak. The newly expanded tool, called Hamilton 2.0, was unveiled Monday by the Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD), which is part of the nonpartisan, U.S.-based German Marshall Fund. Though it previously was dedicated to tracking official accounts and media outlets linked to or funded by the Russian government, it will now also examine account behaviors and trends among Chinese state-backed media, tracking content that Chinese government officials share on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and on state news websites. Among the findings ASD released Monday was that Twitter accounts linked to China's ambassadors, embassies and consulates grew by more than 250% since this time last year, when political protests in Hong Kong first erupted. The group also found that official Chinese accounts frequently retweeted news outlets funded by the Iranian or Russian governments – three of the top five non-Chinese, most-retweeted news outlets were backed by Tehran or Moscow, according the tracker. The analysis also showed a marked evolution in the type of content Chinese accounts shared since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. While early messaging focused on Beijing's efforts to stem the virus' spread, those messages grew more overtly hostile in February and March, as cases proliferated outside of China. Some of those accounts shared conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus and attacked Western officials for criticizing China's role. Several U.S. administration officials, including President Trump, have recently called out Chinese officials for spreading false or misleading information. Mr. Trump appeared to condemn a pair of tweets by the deputy director general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department, Lijian Zhao, who twice linked on Twitter to articles that claimed COVID-19 originated outside of China, and possibly in the U.S. ""China was putting out information which was false, that our military gave this to them. That was false,"" said Mr. Trump, who also for a time defended his own tendency to refer to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese"" virus. He has since stopped using the term. Mr. Trump's own messaging on China has evolved in recent weeks. In January he praised Beijing's ""transparency"" but, more recently, lambasted the Chinese government for spreading propaganda. Late last week, after a phone call with China's president Xi Jinping, Mr. Trump tweeted that the two leaders were ""Working closely together."" On Friday, State Department officials told reporters that they had observed several actors – Russia, China and Iran – promote similar, often false messages about COVID-19. ""During the crisis, we've seen Russian, Chinese, and Iranian state disinformation and propaganda ecosystems all converge around some disinformation themes intended to promote their own agendas,"" said Lea Gabrielle, who heads the State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC). Russia in late January launched an initial disinformation campaign focused on COVID-19, according to GEC, elements of which had since been seized upon by other states; Iranian-backed outlets, for example, have alleged that the U.S. ""weaponized"" the virus. For its part, China had sought to ""falsely blame"" the United States for being the origin of the virus and otherwise pumped out stories favorable to the Chinese Communist Party's handling of the outbreak, Gabrielle said – though she noted the situation was ""fluid"" and that there were early indications that Chinese officials might be moving ""away from disinformation"" on social media. Citing insufficient data, she declined to address whether the campaigns had evolved organically or whether there might have been covert, high-level coordination among the three. U.S. intelligence agencies have consistently warned that other countries, including China and Iran, were likely to follow in Russia's footsteps to engage in online disinformation and influence campaigns. In the most recent public assessment of adversaries' strategic intentions – the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment – intelligence agencies warned that ""China and Russia are more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s."" ""[T]he relationship is likely to strengthen in the coming year as some of their interests and threat perceptions converge,"" the assessment said.",20,3.9576806600971715,2.256434416511709,1.7012462435854623,29
2020-03-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/facebook-twitter-russia-trolls-sophisticated-election-interference/,"Facebook, Twitter Describe Russia Trolls' Sophisticated Election Interference","SAN FRANCISCO (CBS/AP) -- Facebook and Twitter revealed evidence Thursday suggesting that Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. presidential election are getting more sophisticated and harder to detect. The companies said they have removed dozens of fake accounts and pages from their services. Facebook said the network of accounts it removed was in the ""early stages"" of building an audience. It was operated by people in Ghana and Nigeria on behalf of individuals in Russia. The accounts posted about topics such as black history, celebrity gossip and fashion. Twitter, meanwhile, said the accounts it removed tried to sow discord by emphasizing social issues such as race and civil rights without favoring any particular candidate or ideology. The tactics the accounts used to avoid detection -- and that Russia has essentially outsourced the work to countries in West Africa -- shows that foreign interference remains a challenge for Facebook in the months leading to November. The accounts Facebook took down focused on stoking racial divisions. Some posed as legitimate non-governmental organizations in order to deceive people. The take-downs follow a report last week that found Moscow's campaign of election interference hasn't let up since 2016, and in fact has gotten more difficult to detect. That report, from University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Young Mie Kim, found that Russia-linked social media accounts are posting about the same divisive issues — race relations, gun laws and immigration — as they did in 2016, when the Kremlin polluted American voters' feeds with messages about the presidential election. Facebook has since removed those accounts as well. Last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that Russia was still waging ""information warfare"" with an army of fictional social media personas and bots that spread disinformation.

2020-02-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/intelligence-agency-pushes-back-on-reports-that-it-said-russia-is-actively-aiding-trump-2020-02-24/,Intelligence agency pushes back on reports that it said Russia is actively aiding Trump,"Washington — The Office of the Director of National Intelligence pushed back Monday on reports that a senior intelligence official told lawmakers that the Russian government was actively aiding President Trump's reelection, though it did not specify what the official did say at a classified, now-contentious briefing before the House Intelligence Committee on February 13. ""During the [February 13] briefing, the Intelligence Community did not state that Russia is aiding the re-election of President Trump,"" a senior official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) told CBS News. ""This was an interagency briefing with pre-coordinated messages that had been briefed to other congressional committees."" The senior official also said that the briefing, which focused on election security, was broad and covered threats from adversaries beyond Russia. The official's pushback was a rare effort by ODNI, which serves as the head of the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, to dispel inaccurate accounts that have emerged of an intelligence assessment delivered at the House briefing by Shelby Pierson, the Intelligence Community Election Threats Executive. Pierson, a former national intelligence manager for Russia who coordinated election security efforts in 2018, was accompanied at the briefing by representatives from multiple agencies, including the FBI, CIA and NSA. Multiple sources familiar with the briefing told CBS News that Pierson had not stated that Russia was actively aiding Mr. Trump's reelection. Rather, those sources said, the assessment she delivered, which drew from intelligence collected over a period of months from several agencies, indicated that the Russian government had established a preference for Mr. Trump. The subtle but important distinction, sources pointed out, was in Moscow demonstrating a desire for a given outcome — while not yet taking concerted steps to bring it about. Lawmakers from both parties in the briefing requested the raw intelligence that supported the assessment, sources familiar with the briefing said, and briefers indicated that they would follow up to provide relevant materials. It is unclear how long that process might take or what level of detail might be included; intelligence agencies have discretion over what they share with members of congress to protect their sources and methods. The briefing — which included Democrats and Republicans on the committee — infuriated Mr. Trump, who, notified of the briefing by House Republicans, summoned then-acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to explain why Maguire had allowed Democratic lawmakers, including committee chairman Adam Schiff, to be briefed on alleged Russian efforts to interfere in the upcoming election. Schiff served as the lead House manager during the impeachment proceedings that ended in Mr. Trump's acquittal by the Senate last month. Maguire, who assumed the role of acting Director of National Intelligence in August, resigned his post last week after the president announced Maguire would be replaced on a temporary basis by U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. Mr. Trump has since announced that he is considering several candidates to take the role permanently. Any permanent replacement would have to be confirmed by the Senate. Administration officials have contended that Maguire's ouster was unrelated to the president's displeasure with the House briefing. On Sunday, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien said on ""Face the Nation"" that Maguire was ""always planning on leaving within the next couple of weeks"" and praised his tenure as acting intelligence chief. O'Brien also repeatedly denied seeing ""any intelligence"" that supported what he characterized as ""reports that were leaked out of the House."" ""I haven't seen any intelligence that there's any active measures by the Russians to try and get the president re-elected,"" O'Brien said — a statement consistent with the specific denial now issued by ODNI, but does not fully address other potential intelligence on Russia's preferences. O'Brien did say he had ""heard from the FBI"" that ""Russia would like Bernie Sanders to win the Democrat nomination,"" without offering further specifics about the origin of that information. Sanders, who in recent weeks has surged in the primary contest to become the Democratic front-runner, said Friday he had been briefed ""about a month ago"" about Russia's efforts to assist his presidential campaign, and warned Moscow to ""stay out of American elections."" Lawmakers had also been informed of Russia's efforts to assist Sanders' campaign, CBS News confirmed last week. Russia was known to have boosted Sanders' previous presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016. An indictment of over a dozen Russian individuals issued by special counsel Robert Mueller in 2018 described a multi-platform social media push that was designed to denigrate Clinton with the simultaneous aim of assisting Sanders. One official familiar with the House briefing and the underlying intelligence said the intelligence that informed the assessment about Russia's preferences had been shared with senior administration officials and with the intelligence committees in both the House and Senate. The official, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It was not immediately clear what other congressional committees might have received a similar briefing. A spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee declined to confirm whether that panel had been briefed in similar fashion, citing a tradition of not commenting on classified briefings or confirming whether they have taken place.",20,4.187443819187436,0.7915975593889923,3.395846259798444,14
2020-02-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-face-the-nation-us-intelligence-brief-campaigns-russia-interference/,Biden says U.S. intelligence should brief campaigns about Russian interference,"Washington — Former Vice President Joe Biden said Russia is behind fake Facebook accounts that oppose his candidacy and urged the intelligence community to disclose to Democratic campaigns Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2020 election. ""The Russians don't want me to be the nominee,"" Biden said on ""Face the Nation"" in an interview that aired Sunday. ""They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook and they've been taken down, saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running."" The Democratic presidential hopeful said he hasn't been told by the intelligence community or Facebook about the fake accounts traced back to Russia but was sure they've been removed. Facebook in October revealed it took down a network of Russian-backed accounts, including some presenting as local people in swing states. ""No one's helping me to try to get the nomination,"" he said. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 election on President Trump's behalf, in part by using social media to sow division among U.S. voters. The Kremlin's efforts in the last presidential campaign led top government officials to warn Russia would likely attempt to meddle again in 2020. Intelligence officials briefed lawmakers about Russia's ongoing interference efforts on February 13. Senator Bernie Sanders revealed Friday that U.S. officials briefed him roughly a month ago on Moscow's efforts to help his campaign and suggested Russian bots were behind the behavior of so-called ""Bernie Bros,"" the name given to some of his supporters who troll Sanders' detractors. Biden called for the intelligence community to brief the other presidential candidates on Russia's efforts to interfere in 2020, saying intelligence officials ""should inform the rest of us who are running what they told Senator Sanders."" He also questioned why the Trump administration hasn't done more to protect the integrity of U.S. elections. ""Why in God's name haven't we hardened the electoral process, provided hundreds of millions of dollars to states to be able to harden their voter rolls, make sure they can't be attacked?"" he said, adding it's ""outrageous.""",20,1.186102107909902,1.5695180093968601,-0.38341590148695825,29

Speaking to ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien disputed the reports of what was presented during a House Intelligence Committee briefing that he said was ""leaked"" to members of the press. O'Brien said he had ""not seen the finding"" himself. ""From what I understand about the report....I get this second hand, but from Republican congressmen that were in the committee, there was no intelligence behind it,"" O'Brien said. ""I haven't seen any intelligence to support the reports that were leaked out of the House. But it's just hard to comment on that because, again, I wasn't there. And these are leaks that were coming from a House Intel Committee hearing. I haven't seen any intelligence that would- would back up what I'm reading in the papers."" Following the congressional briefing, intelligence officials then briefed the White House on election security and offered the same assessment — that Russia is trying to help Mr. Trump win re-election in 2020 — a senior administration official told CBS. Moscow has since denied that it's trying to interfere in the election and help Mr. Trump, and said the reports are the result of paranoia, according to the Reuters news service.

""The message was, it appears they're favoring one candidate over another, and everybody should be cautious,"" a source who attended the Hill meeting confirmed to CBS News. The New York Times first reported on the briefing at the Capitol. Officials at the briefing offered an assessment reflective of the conclusions of multiple agencies, and lawmakers on both sides asked to see the underlying intelligence. But there was reportedly bipartisan pushback on the House briefing concerning its depth, credibility and the scope of the evidence, a senior administration official told CBS News. The DNI official overseeing election security threats, Shelby Pierson, was not able to present a rock-solid case proving Russia's assistance, according to the senior administration official. A House Intelligence Committee official denied there had been bipartisan pushback on the briefing. A day later, on Friday, February 14, intelligence officials briefed the White House on election security and also offered the same assessment — that Russia is trying to help Mr. Trump win his re-election bid in 2020 — the senior administration official said.

Sources tell CBS News that Mr. Trump was unaware of the classified House briefing and furious when he found out about it from House Republicans. According to the senior administration official, Mr. Trump ""blew his stack"" and repeatedly used an expletive. The Washington Post first reported that Mr. Trump had quarreled with his acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, after intelligence officials briefed lawmakers on the threat of Russian interference. Mr. Trump announced Wednesday that Richard Grenell, the current ambassador to Germany, would replace Maguire in the position. But a congressional source told CBS News ""there is absolutely no connection to replacing Maguire and the briefing — Maguire was on the way out anyway."" The source at the Hill meeting also confirmed that some of the president's Republican allies on the House Intelligence Committee, who were also in the meeting, ""questioned the validity of the information."" But the the information presented wasn't particularly surprising, the source said, since former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats had already warned months ago that when it comes to Russian election interference, ""the lights are still flashing red."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted late Thursday that another briefing is planned, saying, ""We await the election security briefing for Members on March 10."" She also chided the president: Intelligence officials have been suggesting publicly and privately that Russia and other adversaries have been refining their disinformation methods, working to spread and amplify their messages through ""authentic"" U.S. sources, rather than creating personas that can be flagged by social media companies as fake identities. Top administration officials, including Attorney General Bill Barr, FBI Director Christopher Wray and ex-Acting DNI Joseph Maguire, alluded to this phenomenon in a USA Today op-ed Wednesday. They warned Americans that some foreign governments have tried to meddle in U.S. affairs ""by attempting to shape public opinion and voter perceptions."" ""Often, we see foreign adversaries amplifying messages some Americans create and share with each other, in an effort to stoke hostility among us and make us appear more divided than we are,"" they wrote. Multiple intelligence and government officials have said they fear that U.S. adversaries could also use ransomware to target state and local governments. And they worry that there could be cyber operations launched that target voting infrastructure, to obtain voter data not to change it, but rather to microtarget voters with disinformation.

2020-02-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-intelligence-committee-report-details-obamas-response-to-russian-meddling/,"Bipartisan Senate report urges presidents to ""put aside politics"" to fight election interference","Washington — A bipartisan report released by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday recommended that the president of the United States ""separate himself or herself from political considerations"" when dealing with foreign interference in U.S. elections, including ""explicitly putting aside politics"" when addressing the public on election threats. The report, which details — and, in many instances, harshly faults — the Obama administration's response to the coordinated interference campaign waged by Russia ahead of the 2016 presidential election, also said sitting officials and political candidates should exercise ""the absolute greatest amount of restraint and caution"" when calling forthcoming election results into question. ""Such a grave allegation can have significant national security and electoral consequences,"" the report warned, ""including limiting the response options of the appropriate authorities, and exacerbating the already damaging messaging efforts of foreign intelligence services."" The release of the 54-page document comes one day after President Trump was acquitted by the Senate of impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. At the crux of the case against the president were allegations Mr. Trump ordered the withholding of military aid from Ukraine in a pressure campaign to force Kyiv announce an investigation targeting former Vice President Joe Biden, now a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. The report's release also follows an effective meltdown in reporting results from Monday's Iowa caucuses, after a faulty smartphone app delayed final delegate counts for days. The delays prompted some Democrats to raise questions about the integrity of the vote, and some officials affiliated with the Trump campaign suggested on social media that the process had been ""rigged."" The Senate panel's latest chapter marks the third installment of what is expected to be five volumes of findings released by the committee, which began its investigation into Russia's coordinated influence campaign targeting the 2016 presidential election in January of 2017. The partially redacted third volume consolidates findings from numerous interviews with Obama administration officials, most of whom said constraints stemming from divisive political realities at the time may have impeded their ability to issue a robust response to Moscow. Information silos maintained within the administration — and a delayed awareness of the sheer scope and purpose of Russia's influence campaign — also hampered the government's handling, Thursday's report said. ""The Committee found that the U.S. Government was not well-postured to counter Russian election interference activity with a full range of readily-available policy options,"" its investigators wrote. The report found that the five warnings issued directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin and other senior Russian officials by Mr. Obama and his national security team failed to have a meaningful deterrent effect. The administration also failed to link Russia's cyber activities — which included a weaponized release of information hacked from Democratic political entities and a wide-reaching misinformation campaign on social media — with Moscow's broader influence campaign until August of 2016, just three months before the election. Republican Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the committee, said Obama officials were ""frozen by 'paralysis of analysis,'"" and ""hamstrung by constraints both real and perceived."" ""Obama officials debated courses of action without truly taking one,"" Burr said. ""Many of their concerns were understandable, including the fear that warning the public of the election threat would only alarm the American people and accomplish Russia's goal of undermining faith in our democratic institutions."" ""We must continue building on the lessons of 2016,"" Burr said. ""There were many flaws with the U.S. response to the 2016 attack, but it's worth noting that many of those were due to problems with our own system,"" Democratic Vice Chairman Mark Warner said. ""I am particularly concerned however, that a legitimate fear raised by the Obama Administration — that warning the public of the Russian attack could backfire politically — is still present in our hyper-partisan environment."" The report recounts the belated awareness most Obama administration officials had about Russia's hack of the Democratic National Committee, noting most said in interviews that they first learned of the intrusion in a story in The Washington Post in June 2016. Even then, there was no immediate suspicion that the hack could be part of a broader effort by Russia to undermine the election, investigators found. ""Witnesses told the Committee that the initial reaction of administration officials and the Intelligence Community (IC) was that Russia's cyber activity targeting the DNC fell within the bounds of traditional espionage and was not understood immediately to be a precursor to an active measures campaign,"" the report said. A section that would appear to detail the intelligence community's eventual ""wake-up call"" is almost entirely redacted, but the report says then-national security advisor Susan Rice called for the material to be briefed to President Obama ""within an hour or two"" of her learning the information. The receipt of the unspecified ""sensitive intelligence"" then spurred members of Mr. Obama's National Security Council to craft options for an official response, according to the report. The apparent sensitivity of that information, though, led meetings about the matter to be ""extraordinarily restricted,"" the committee found, citing officials who said intelligence was disseminated in a manner ""reminiscent of the highly restricted meetings employed prior to the U.S. military operation to capture Osama bin Laden."" The highly restricted intelligence — and the small group of principals to which it was confined — posed an additional constraint on the administration's ability to deliberate and effect response options, committee investigators said. Lisa Monaco, the former assistant to the president for homeland security and counter terrorism, said in an interview cited by the report that Mr. Obama's ""clear guidance"" to the national security team was ""first and foremost ... to protect the integrity of the election"" and make sure vulnerabilities were promptly addressed with state and local governments. But officials were further daunted by the possibility that Moscow had the ability to take other, more destructive actions. ""Ambassador Rice feared a range of additional actions Putin could take such as affecting votes, altering or deleting voter registration data, or falsifying and releasing information online that appeared to be authentic,"" the report said. ""She stated that Secretary [Jeh] Johnson, as the head of [the Department of Homeland Security, DHS], decided to alert states and urge the secretaries of state to harden systems associated with their respective election infrastructure."" Above all, officials said they were wary that, by issuing a public warning about Moscow's activities, they would seed the very doubts Russia was aiming to grow. More than one official said the administration had to be careful about not ""doing the Russians' dirty work for them."" ""Administration officials told the Committee that they did not want the response to Russian election interference to be seen as a politically motivated action in an already highly political environment,"" the report said. ""They were concerned that warning the public about Russian efforts would be interpreted as the White House siding with one candidate. They pointed out in interviews that candidate Trump was, at the time, publicly saying that the election would be 'rigged.'"" Efforts to avoid politics and get the intelligence community to ""come to a unified, high-confidence conclusion"" as to Russia's targets and intentions also ""took longer than we would have hoped or anticipated,"" Rice said, which complicated the administration's efforts to issue attribution to Moscow. Congressional leaders were also unwilling to issue a bipartisan statement reinforcing the administration's findings to prompt states to harden their election infrastructure. Monaco and former CIA Director John Brennan said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told them during a September 2016 meeting, ""[y]ou security people should be careful that you're not getting used."" (The report says Burr, who was also present for the meeting, said McConnell's question related to the possibility that Russia's efforts could be enhanced, rather than blunted, by a statement from Congress.) Despite expectations it would be ""above the fold news,"" the public statement that eventually was issued — an unprecedented joint statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and DHS — was almost immediately eclipsed by news of the Access Hollywood videotape of then-candidate Trump, which was soon followed by the weaponized release of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. Apart from urging U.S. officials to address issues of election integrity with utmost care and apart from politics, the committee's recommendations stressed the need for future administrations to engage more fulsomely with countries on Russia's periphery, which, committee investigators said, Moscow uses ""as a laboratory for refining its active measures campaigns."" They also urged the U.S. government to establish norms governing cyber activity and to position future cyber events in a full ""geopolitical context."" The report called on ODNI to provide a ""regular, apolitical assessment of foreign intelligence threats to U.S. elections, including clandestine foreign influence campaigns prior to regularly scheduled federal elections."" ""Executive and legislative branch officials, regardless of party affiliation, should jointly and publicly reinforce the DNI's findings, particularly if a foreign influence effort is directed at specific candidates seeking office,"" the committee recommended. It also said the public should be informed ""as soon as possible"" of any influence campaign targeting elections, even if information is incomplete. ""Delaying the release of information allows inaccurate narratives to spread, which makes the task of informing the public significantly harder,"" the committee wrote. In November, a group of federal agencies released a one-page framework that sets out how government entities, political candidates and the public would be notified of foreign interference. The Senate Intelligence Committee is expected to release two more chapters, including one that is likely to be highly redacted and reviews the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment of Russian activities in the U.S. elections. The final volume on the counterintelligence concerns stemming from any political campaign links to Moscow. The committee previously released two volumes of its final product. The first focused on election security and was made public in July. It was followed by a second — released in October — on the interference campaign Russia waged on social media.",20,1.433610672484483,0.5047006026406536,0.9289100698438294,29

""Countries seek to influence each other all the time. And when it becomes particularly problematic is when it's covert, when it's subversive, when it's illegal,"" said Shelby Pierson, who serves as the intelligence community's election threats executive. ""And we do not assess that any other country influenced the United States election in 2016 on the scale of what the Russians did."" In an interview with Intelligence Matters host and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell, Pierson, who was named to the newly created role in July by then-Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, declined to discuss whether Russian intelligence operatives were behind the seeding or propagation of the notion that Ukraine sought to interfere in 2016. ""[W]e can't speak about our current classified assessment on this situation,"" she said. ""But for us, all roads lead back to Russia in this particular circumstance. And it's something that we continue to monitor at this time."" As impeachment proceedings – which have centered on Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine's political leadership – gathered steam in the fall, allies of the president argued that Mr. Trump was justified in withholding military aid from Kiev out of concerns about corruption and whether Ukraine meddled against his campaign in 2016. They pointed to anti-Trump comments made by Ukrainian officials on social media and efforts to discredit Paul Manafort, who was Mr. Trump's campaign chairman. Numerous current and former officials, including Pierson, have since countered the idea that the actions of some Ukrainian officials were comparable to the top-down interference campaign that U.S. intelligence agencies have since concluded was ordered by Russian president Vladimir Putin and carried out by various instruments of the Russian government. In her public testimony during House-led impeachment hearings in November, Fiona Hill, a Russia expert who served on the National Security Council, said suggestions that Ukraine intervened in a similar manner was ""a fictional narrative"" that bolstered Moscow's efforts to deflect blame for its actions. And last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray said in an interview that the bureau had ""no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election."" Pierson, a career intelligence officer, was named the National Intelligence Manager for Russia, Europe and Eurasia at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in November of 2016, beginning the job roughly two weeks before President Obama asked the intelligence community to begin working on the document now known as the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA). While she did not have a direct hand in drafting the ICA – which laid out the intelligence community's conclusions about the scope and aim of Russia's activities in 2016 – Pierson's experience with disseminating its findings led to her subsequent role as crisis manager for election security during the 2018 midterm elections. Russians engaged ""less"" in 2018 than in 2016, Pierson said, in part because of the midterms' lower profile, and in part because U.S. agencies coordinated more extensively to blunt foreign interference efforts. The Department of Homeland Security helped states better protect their voting infrastructure. The FBI also engaged more robustly with social media companies, and U.S. Cyber Command, Pierson said, took a more active role ""in terms of managing the information space even before it got stateside."" (Cyber Command took a Russian troll farm known to have led disinformation efforts in 2016 offline in the run-up to the 2018 midterms). Pierson said the intelligence community, alongside its partner agencies in the U.S. government, was preparing to face a ""watershed moment"" during the 2020 presidential election, and that influence efforts since 2016 have grown broader, more complicated, and, in the cases of some adversaries, more sophisticated. ""[F]oreign influence and foreign interference is a 24/7, 365 endeavor,"" she told Morell, ""I certainly think that we are looking at considerable foreign influence challenges."" Some operations, she said, were overt, ""and that's natural and understood behavior across nations."" ""And then what happens that I think is the concern for us is: When does that sponsorship…of an adversary become more murky, if not fully concealed, to the recipient of the information?"" she continued. ""[T]here is perhaps not wholesale interference, but you have this broader ecosystem and landscape of influence operations that are seeking to sway the populace in a direction. And that's probably I think most of the continuum of what we saw in 2018 and 2019 and certainly what we're concerned about going into 2020,"" Pierson said. U.S. government officials have issued repeated warnings that countries including Russia, China, Iran and North Korea – as well as non-state 'hacktivists' – were likely to target the upcoming election in pursuit of their own respective objectives. Pierson told Morell a key part of the post-2016 adjustments made to election security efforts would involve notifying victims of cyber compromise more promptly and fulsomely. In November, a group of federal agencies, including ODNI, released a framework for how disclosures to private entities, congressional stakeholders, presidential candidates and the public would work. ""[T]his has been a continuum of introspection and activity coming out of 2016,"" Pierson said. ""What we're trying to do now is handle this in real time…we're not trying to simply intellectually look back on what occurs in 2021 past inauguration."" ""What we want to do is be able to affect this in real time and so that we have fair, safe elections from foreign interference,"" she said.

2020-01-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/top-u-s-election-security-official-says-adversaries-have-sharpened-interference-tools-ahead-of-2020/,"Top U.S. election security official says adversaries have ""sharpened"" interference tools ahead of 2020","A top U.S. election security official warned on Tuesday that the country faces threats from adversaries beyond Russia, and can count on ""more sophisticated"" attacks from other state and non-state actors ahead of the 2020 presidential election. ""This is not a Russia-only problem,"" said Shelby Pierson, who serves as the intelligence community's election threats executive within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. ""Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, [and] non-state hacktivists all have opportunity, means, and potentially motive to come after the United States in the 2020 election to accomplish their goals."" Pierson spoke at a U.S. Election Assistance Commission summit in Washington, DC, where she also said key adversaries had likely honed and made adjustments to their interference tactics based on past actions taken by the U.S. ""They've learned from the volume of information that we have shared,"" Pierson said. ""They have learned — certainly based upon red-teaming the results of some of our operations — and they have sharpened their own capabilities."" The U.S. intelligence community determined that Russia, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, engaged in a wide-ranging and systematic interference campaign that was designed to boost then-candidate Trump's chances of winning while damaging Hillary Clinton's. To date, public evidence of U.S. election interference efforts by Iran, China and North Korea remains relatively scarce. Social media companies including Facebook and Twitter have several times removed pro-Iranian, state-sponsored materials from their platforms. In September 2018, President Trump accused China of ""meddling"" in the midterms against his administration because of its tougher trade policies. Mr. Trump later posted on Twitter what he called ""propaganda ads"" — images of paid ads China had placed in the Des Moines Register and other newspapers. Intelligence officials have frequently cited the preparations and proactive steps agencies took ahead of the 2018 midterm elections as key to ensuring their security. General Paul Nakasone, who heads U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, has said he would model those agencies' approach to the 2020 elections on the three-part process used in 2018: understanding adversaries, sharing information about them, and imposing costs on them if they attempted to interfere in U.S. political processes. (U.S. Cyber Command used an offensive attack to take a Russian troll farm offline in the run-up to the midterms.) Pierson, who assumed her post in July, also said that the intelligence community would be making efforts to share more unclassified information about agencies' election security preparations, though it is unclear how specific that information would be and how frequently or widely it would be shared. In November, ODNI released a one-page framework governing how lawmakers, the private sector and the public would be notified of foreign interference. ""We are committed to sharing that information [related to adversaries] as we can with all relevant stakeholders, as we go forward into 2020,"" Pierson said. ""This is a balancing act. And I recognize it's one that inevitably will leave certain parties unsatisfied.""",20,0.6030717394564269,1.2507968314569,-0.6477250920004731,29

The operation began in early November, as a congressional impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump was underway. That inquiry examined whether Mr. Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Burisma and the Bidens. The hacking campaign was carried out by the Russian intelligence agency GRU, according to Area 1, the Silicon Valley-based company that discovered the breach. It is unclear what kinds of materials the hackers accessed or sought. The New York Times was first to report on the hacking campaign. Area 1 said the GRU hacking group, also known as ""Fancy Bear,"" launched a phishing campaign targeting Burisma employees in an effort to steal their usernames and passwords and enable the hackers to access employee accounts. ""We don't know what (the GRU is) going to do,"" Area 1 co-founder and CEO Oren Falkowitz told CBS News in a phone interview. ""I can just tell you from my experience working for the U.S. government: It's impossible to know what a hacker wants. You can just sometimes see that they're doing it."" Falkowitz said he spent seven years working at the National Security Agency, including some with an elite hacking unit known as Tailored Access Operations. ""Our report is not noteworthy because we identify the GRU launching a phishing campaign, nor is the targeting of a Ukrainian company particularly novel,"" the report says. ""It is significant because Burisma Holdings is publically [sic] entangled in U.S. foreign and domestic politics."" U.S. intelligence officials concluded that Russian hackers linked to GRU were responsible for hacking the email servers of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election. The emails were eventually disseminated through DCLeaks and WikiLeaks and amplified by a network of bot accounts on social media. Intelligence agencies later concluded that the hack was designed to boost the election chances of Donald Trump and damage those of Hillary Clinton. ""The timing of the GRU's campaign in relation to the 2020 U.S. elections raises the spectre that this is an early warning of what we have anticipated since the successful cyberattacks undertaken during the 2016 U.S. elections,"" the Area 1 report said. Falkowitz warned that, ""The hackers' relatively low-tech approach is a reminder that cyber attacks do not have to be sophisticated to be successful. ... Once again, phishing attacks were the root cause of a cyber security incident, which is the case in 95% of cybersecurity damages."" The Biden campaign declined to comment on the specifics of the report, but seized on the findings to criticize the president. ""Donald Trump tried to coerce Ukraine into lying about Joe Biden and a major bipartisan, international anti-corruption victory because he recognized that he can't beat the Vice President. Now we know that Vladimir Putin also sees Joe Biden as a threat,"" the Biden campaign's rapid response director Andrew Bates told CBS News. ""Any American president who had not repeatedly encouraged foreign interventions of this kind would immediately condemn this attack on the sovereignty of our elections."" No evidence has emerged that Hunter or Joe Biden broke any U.S. or Ukrainian laws in relation to Hunter's tenure on the Burisma board. Burisma did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Area 1 also said the phishing campaign was connected to another one targeting a media organization founded by Zelensky.",20,0.0,0.0,0.0,16
2019-12-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-any-mobile-app-developed-in-russia-potential-counterintelligence-threat/,"FBI warns that any mobile app developed in Russia could be ""potential counterintelligence threat""","The FBI views any app developed in Russia to be a ""potential counterintelligence threat,"" the agency warned Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer late last month. The FBI informed Schumer, a New York Democrat, of its concerns regarding products made in Russia after he warned of the possible national security and privacy risks raised by FaceApp, a photo-editing application that exploded in popularity this summer. ""The FBI considers any mobile application or similar product developed in Russia, such as FaceApp, to be a potential counterintelligence threat, based on the data the product collects, its privacy and terms of use policies, and the legal mechanisms available to the government of Russia that permits access to data within Russia's borders,"" Jill Tyson, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, told Schumer in a letter dated November 25. Schumer urged the FBI and Federal Trade Commission in July to examine the possible risks posed by FaceApp, which counted celebrities like Carrie Underwood, the Jonas Brothers, and Drake among its users. ""It would be deeply troubling if the sensitive personal information of U.S. citizens was provided to a hostile foreign power actively engaged in cyber hostilities against the United States,"" Schumer wrote in a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray and FTC chair Joseph Simons. In response to Schumer's letter, Tyson noted that while FaceApp loads user photos to cloud servers hosted in the United States, Singapore, Ireland, and Australia, Russia's intelligence services can ""remotely access all communications and servers on Russian networks without making a request to [Internet service providers]."" While FaceApp maintains it removes most photos from its servers within 48 hours, Tyson noted Russia's intelligence services boast ""robust cyber exploitation capabilities."" FaceApp is owned by Wireless Lab, based in St. Petersburg, Russia. As privacy concerns surrounding the app mounted several months ago, the Democratic National Committee warned 2020 Democratic presidential campaigns against using the smartphone app.",20,0.0,0.0,0.0,16
